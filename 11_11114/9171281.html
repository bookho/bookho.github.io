			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Red Dragon did not wait for the leader of the Dragon Tooth and other people to return to the Longshan State to launch the final attack, which was retained by the dwarves, and was uneven. The old city walls have become a new obstacle for the Grinada people, but the people in the city-states are not happy with this. For the first time, they saw that the casters were able to attack like a military. They lined up in a row and cast the same. The spells, the foundations of the walls were shaken, and they collapsed like a domino. It was almost impossible in other places, because the wizards and warlocks could not have all their spells and spirits. The power is spent on similar spells, which will allow them to die when they encounter a raid, but here in Grenada, they can get the shelter of their companions as long as they follow the orders of the Red Dragon, without having to consider their own safety. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So before, was she teasing us?" one of the city councillors muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If yes, I beg her to continue to tease," the consul said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the city are calming down, they know what they are going to face - the shadow of the lion's lion's body covers half the sky, Greiner The warlocks and flames of Dad poured down the lightning and flames that occupied the entire field of vision. At the beginning, they could rescue each other, but when a small city-state was destroyed, this unreliable trap was torn open. A gap, the Grinada people swarmed in, the front, back, left, right, top and bottom of the city-state seem to be surging with the enemy, everyone is fighting, old people, children, men, women, they Use wooden beams and furniture to cook fat and boiling water, use beautiful bronze statues and marble sculptures to serve as rolling stones, use the wood for threshing to fight against the steel thorns with thorns, and the merchants move gold and silver coins from the secret room to brighten them. The sparkling little discs are scattered into the crowd, and the greedy goblin will desperately pick up and let the city-state soldiers get a chance to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they waiting for?" Members asked, the Dragon Claws’ Deinonychus and their knights did not join the chaotic battle, instead They arrayed outside the range of the arrows, and the black armor and cloak seemed like a solid night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait for the body to pile up." A knight said in a hurry, he ran, shouted loudly, and asked the city's mage to cast a flame to burn the bodies, or It is dumping grease and then igniting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he ran up, the array of Dragon Claws began to move, first a minimal triangular formation, like a sign showing directions The other knights followed the orderly forward, the pace was the same, first slow-moving, then fast-paced, then rushing, when the first fearing dragon was clear enough to let people see the face of the knight It jumped up high, and the claws stretched out in the air. When they fell, they pierced deeply into the shoulders of a giant, and then rushed out without a trace of pause. Its movements were so beautiful and swift. The spells and arrows thrown by the wizard all fall behind it. The warlocks it carries make gestures, a spell is unfolding in the air, and the second wave of arrows is pushed away by a blast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers failed to wait for the third chance to raise the longbow and the bow, and the fear claws fell into them. It was so embarrassing, not as The lack of wisdom is as eager to sharpen their teeth. The warlocks of Grenada immediately cast spells that were prepared in the air, and a poisonous dark green mist swept from their feet and spread around them. But an adult's smoke can't hurt the Deinonychus and the people on it, but it can cause serious damage to the mortal who lack protection - their eyes and tongue will melt, and the flesh will be burned like Charred black and falling off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A city-state mage waved his arm, the wind passed through the crowd and took the smoke, but as soon as he appeared, a lightning from the air Hit him, the rune on the mage shines, blocking the attack for him, but the fear claw dragon just jumped, crossed the crowd, slightly on one side of the head, and bit the one of the mage Arm. He was lifted up, and this tenacious man was able to pull out a reel at this time, but a small spell interrupted his finger, the reel fell to the ground, and the dragon claw knight's spear was running through his chest. . The warlock twisted his fingers, and the invisible servant picked up the scroll for him. He glanced at him and received his arms with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brake!" The governor who witnessed all this shouted: "Get ready!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The car is to deal with the red dragon," the congressman around him shouted: "Those are enchanted arrows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way," The consul said: "The red dragon may not occupy the entire city state at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can we defeat them?" the congressman murmured, and there were always eagle-headed lions falling from the sky, but the haze that covered the city-state never dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are not defeating them." The Archon said, hiding another sentence - they are just fighting, fighting to the last moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last moment came so fast, when the last enchanted arrow shot an eagle-headed lion, the scene suddenly appeared on the battlefield. The calm, then the guards of the city-state heard the cheers of the enemy, like the wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no enchantment arrow, the casters die one after another, ordinary knights and soldiers can not even fight against the Guardian Legion of the Greinada, the city-state The ground was swallowed up by the black mud, the red dragons spread their wings, gliding under the blue-violet scorpio, and the residual light was inlaid with gold on the edge of her scales. It looked so perfect, evil and huge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor of Longshan City State stared at the scene until the Red Dragon landed on the tower less than a hundred feet away from him, they looked at each other, golden eyes The manchu full of malicious and mocking mortals, the consul noticed that the red dragon's neck was abnormally raised, and the scales shimmered like a flame. No, a group of dragon fires were bred in the red dragon. In the sac, as long as she has a mouth, he will immediately become ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes the Red Dragon unexpected is that the Archon actually smiled at her, and he reached into his arms, and the Red Dragon lowered his head slightly. There is no magic rune in humans. She believes in her spells, but her instinct still allows her to erect every scale - just as the Red Dragon gives up the intention of teasing this human being, preparing for a dragon fire to end all the time. The consul took out a rock, which is as big as a baby's fist. It has eighty-nine faces. Even if it is dark now, it is still like a jumping star when it is in his hand. The action suddenly stopped. The Longshan City State has many legends about the Silver Dragon. One of them is that they have a rock of a silver dragon heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time she paused may be shorter than a breath, but a smashing arrow, an enchanted arrow that has been prepared for hundreds of years, accompanied by a bang The loud noise, from the place where the governor stood, the human body formed a powder, the red dragon screamed back and raised his wings, she could feel something violently hitting herself, studded in The runes and gems on the Mithril chain were shattered and turned into ineffective debris. She thought she could fly, but the sharp pain came from the right wing, and she saw the one. Although the arrow did not hit her key, she nailed the membrane wing on her right side to the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the Red Dragon stunned the entire city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar and his team have already had two injured people, fortunately They are all knights. After all, they have only four casters with their dark-haired dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just got rid of a group of tangled winged demon snakes, they are buried in the ground like mud bats, and once they pass, they will fly out, if What is the difference, that is, they are more difficult to deal with and in addition to acid and venom, the soul of the outside world lost a wand (although he does not think it is a loss), this wand should have been ejected from the broken place. A series of fireballs, but the soul of the outside world wisely broke it and threw it out. The broken wand exploded without touching the ground. The flame almost made a delicious barbecue together with them - some on the edge. The devil still barely retains some of his body, and a warlock picks it up and cuts off his belly, finding a piece of meat inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is human...the pancreas." The warlock said, watching the surroundings with vigilance: "But it is not like there are adventurers or mercenaries. The way we come." The frenzied magic zone is already enough trouble, let alone there are so many monsters here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If someone raises them, it's a different matter." The dark-haired dragon said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the host we are going to visit does not welcome outsiders," said a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since I can be known by the Red Dragon, and send out an invitation." Danos said: "Then he will not be an ordinary guy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only hope that he is not so sensitive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
