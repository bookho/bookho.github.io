			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When do you think the orcs will attack?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the snow is over "Kerry Ben said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Regular, huh?" Birdwin said with a smile, wearing a thick velvet gloved finger stroking the scabbard of the broad sword. "What have you seen?" "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no place worth noting," said the Ranger: "It is this that makes me uneasy."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin patted his friend's shoulder heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands why the Elf Ranger is worried, and no one can keep calm in the case of the wolves, especially if there is a group of people who have no backs and hungry. The wolf - but he is not so worried, in any case, this is just a war, like the war that will happen in the early winter of each year, blood, pain, death, he has experienced twenty such wars From a humble identity, only a young hunter with a pair of clothes and a string of bows became the owner of Thunder Castle - he also clearly remembers the feeling of archery pointing down on the wall with bare feet, more vivid than fear. It was the numbness and tingling caused by the cold. When an orc jumped on the mouth and wanted to tear him apart, the old sergeant’s sword cut off the head of the orc. After the battle, he got a pair of boots. It's a good pair of boots, although it's a bit big, but he is more willing to put it on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two years after the battle, he became one of the old masters of the old lord, then he became a knight, he married Penny, married I still wore those boots, and the boots were already fitting his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second snow lasted for one day and one night, on the morning of the third day The clouds are thinner, the light becomes brighter, and the entire dragon's belly is covered with white snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the imagination of ordinary people, the war between humans and orcs must be extremely fierce and cruel, perhaps, but if you think it will have a drama When the mines started, it was a big mistake. The first one who died in this war was not even a human or an orc, but an ordinary brownstone python. It was picked from the body immediately after being awakened. The branches vacated and wanted to fly into the air, which it thought was a safe place, but in the next moment, the white claws of the two scales were caught and the iron shackles were pierced. Its head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind sent the smell of blood and winter wine. Winter wine is a precious drink in the poorly planted orcs. Except for their princes, priests and warriors, ordinary orcs can only drink mixed blood before the war. Winter wine, this kind of drink from humans can boil the blood in their bodies, release their souls and paralyze their pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defenders of Thunderbolt acted in an orderly manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The archers staggered through the dark passages in the walls, stopping from time to time to see if the moving stones that plugged the shooting holes could be pulled out smoothly - some The stones will be frozen or entangled by the roots of the climbing plants. They look out. It is better than ever that heavy snow only accumulates to the knee height. In the years when it was particularly cold, the snow did not even pass the lowest row of shooting holes. The blizzard obscured their sight. Many times, the orcs rushed to the position where the bow and arrow were about to fail, and they were discovered by them, and they exceeded the height of the person. Snow has also become their best shelter and armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The channel is crowded, cold and dark, and the glass bottles hanging from the top and the wall are filled with phosphorus fire to provide the necessary illumination. This is not suitable for use with torches or braziers. The archers put their hands in their arms while waiting for them to prevent them from stiffening at a critical moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers on the wall began the last inspection and launch of the cannon, the small torsion trebuchet, the wooden platform that extended the wall, the temporary wooden passage around the wall, etc. ——They burned the snow ice in a large pot on the wall, and when they melted, they spilled on all the woodwork and the wall. Some water flowed into the shooting hole along the crack of the stone, and it was wet. Looking at the archers at the edge of the shooting hole led to a very loud yell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More water is being hijacked by the harsh low temperature when it is sloping on the wall, they are so soft and fragile when they are still water, no defense But the ice that they condensed is so hard, like a set of colorless steel armor for the walls of Thunder, and even sharp spears are difficult to penetrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry and some of the elves are scattered on the tower and the wall, holding the triangle bow that is quite common among the elves, the bow of the silver crown, Glittering with a metallic silver-gray luster, he has a quiver under his feet, which contains nearly twenty arrows. He pulls one of them and puts on a bowstring, as if just greeting the old friend and caressing gently. But with a short beep, a big bird screams screaming from the gray sky, falling heavily in the distance of the black hair caster but only a few feet away - it is an easy Impressive bird, it's bare, even a triangle with no fluff is black, but the curved forward and the big tumor-like sac are red, which makes it look Just like always burying his head in the internal organs, his vitality is similar to that of ordinary birds. Kerry’s arrow runs through its neck, and the knights pour oil on it, ignite it and then use it. The spear took it and threw it out of the wall. The flame burned on it, but after it was dropped from the wall, the cry of the old man crying and laughing like a child continued for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red 嗦 vulture," Kerry said: "The orc god Kauka's sacred bird, the orc priests feeding them, they eat carrion and poisonous snakes, claws, cockroaches, blood and feathers are poisonous and can cause plague "Bugs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the ominous sign that the orcs have shown to their enemies." The Ranger stared into the distance and said, "They are coming." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More red vultures pass through the valley and fly to Thunderbolt. If the same kind is shot before they reach the city wall, they will fall in the The snow-stained snow is rushing to the top, and when they stretch their heads and look up, even the most tough and brave warriors will shudder at the eyes full of jealousy and viciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver flute of the elf first penetrated the cold, transparent air, followed by the human horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that appears at the other end of the mouth is the warrior of the orc, but the human slave of the orc. The young half-orc is old and injured and can’t Ordinary orcs fighting, they spread out unevenly, swaying forward steadily, constantly pricking the ground in front of the branches in their hands, every step is very careful - but that doesn't mean they You can walk through the entire canyon safely - Krimaar helps the people of Thunderbolt to set traps in the canyon. Under the premise that the weather is cold enough, the wizard casts spells to make the soil soft and the ground collapses. Hidden and covered is a straw mat soaked in water. After being frozen, it can withstand a human girl walking on it, but it can't afford the weight of an orc. No matter the size of the style, it is Heavy and abnormal siege equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beasts of these orcs were only used to test and fill the traps. When the first person fell into the trap, no one of them was surprised. Although the pace of progress inevitably slowed down - human slaves were the first to be exhausted, except for the instinctual screams that fell into the trap, they didn't make any more noise - maybe they knew that It’s just in vain, whether it’s painful sorrow or sorrow for help. However, those half-orcs and ordinary orcs who are still in their infancy will still hold a glimpse of the hope of the people after falling into the trap, but only a large amount of snow is greeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc soldiers who followed will push the snow around them into deep pits, and turn a deaf to those curses and pleadings. These traps are not fatal, bottom There are neither sharp wood thorns nor venomous snakes, and humans, half-orcs and orcs who fall into the trap are almost alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
