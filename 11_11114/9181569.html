			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the gnomes has a very interesting name. In the language of the gnome, it means long, that is, he is higher than the ordinary gnome. So one or two inches, when he was a child and a young gnome, he had a gnome name, but because he was extremely proud of his height, his name was less and less raised, but the nickname "long" became The one that is most often called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older age is a little older than McGee’s father. Of course, in the gnome's ethnic group, age is not the key to becoming a leader. The distinct level, as described before, the gnomes have elders and parliamentarians, but unlike the elders who dwarf the last drop of blood and ale for the ethnic group, the elders of the gnomes are more like the guilds of the craftsmen of the human race. The leader, who replaced most of the gnomes and humans in negotiating and trading, charged them two commissions. They hired mercenaries and mages to ensure their safety and rule over other tribes. If there is anything to be said, then That is, they can suppress their greedy heart and pretend to be an illusion of peace and prosperity for the people, but no one knows what the truth is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, compared to the skills and experience of forging and assembly, the gnomes’ leaders should know how to climb, deceive, and bribe. The gnomes agree that this is The most important thing - he must be cruel, keen, know how to look at the color, flattering, deceiving, squatting, and circling, just as Birdwin and others just arrived at the Dragon Fire Island, the gnomes have ruthlessly laughed. They trampled and attacked them, but once the black-haired dragon became the nominal lord, and the Baldwin knights surpassed the total number of gnomes in a few days, the long and his people 亟Don't wait to yell at them, don't forget to poke your nose into the sand every time you lick. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When attempting to seize the legacy of McGee’s father, he long ordered his daughter to marry the temperamental and grotesque gnome. The wonderful thing is that ** is really like McGee. Maybe it’s the reason why McGee’s skills are really impeccable. Young people always have to be simpler than the older ones. But McGee also knows that if she asks for ** to pour poison into his honey wine, ** will do the same, she may grieve for 30 days or forty days, and then become her father's designated Another gnome's wife - after all, lost McGee, she still has a father as a gnome leader, and lost her father, she is just an ordinary gnome, whoever counts this account is simple. The gnomes are like this, there is nothing to be considered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now McGee wants to have a home, has a child, and the ** thing is put on the trip again, and McGee doesn’t feel that he is Still as lonely and helpless as when he was on the island of Longhuo, he finally went side by side with Birdwin for a while. The friendship between them was meager, but there was still, and Birdwin’s Mithril arm still needed him. Maintenance and repair, this is something that no human, dwarf or gnome can do. He holds the most important chips in his hand, no need to worry about someone stealing his stable life - in the Dragon Fire Island, the gnomes The inheritance is always a bloody rancid smell. It is not a rare thing to hire a mercenary and a mage to terminate the life of a dwarf. After the emergence of the new lord, the leader of the gnome group will be replaced. A hidden convention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If McGee wants to be the leader of the gnomes, it’s not difficult, he has a whole country behind him, and the gnomes must take their breath to survive here. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Have you considered this long? Of course, there are, but he is worried that the lord of the East Guandao has fallen into a state of depression and madness. The irony is that the East Crown has not been attacked by the other three main islands, because there is a group of powerful And a lot of outsiders took a break in the side of the island, but as Baldwin and Leona returned to the land, their knights and soldiers followed, leaving only their wives and children. There are very few people who are still left to protect the priests and slaves of the Rosada on the side. They have neither power nor obligation to the gnomes. The problem is that although they are not interested in the wealth of the gnomes and the gnomes themselves, But there are others who like it, and the other three gnomes on the main island have been eager to move – perhaps their lords are also, the islands of the long ethnic group have been attacked several times by pirates, of course, everyone knows Pirates are just a concealed and implicit statement. Everyone knows that those people are the mercenaries of the lords. Afterwards, even the eunuchs of the East Crown began to confess the gold coins in the hands of Confucianism. They became greedy and even vaguely thought of turning gnomes into slaves. By the time I was alert, there were no fewer than ten gnomes who became the captives of that herb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long believes that during this time, he can try to win the favor and favor of those in power, as he did on the Longhuo Island, although McGee’s father is smarter than him. A pair of unparalleled skill, but still in the battle for the position of the leader, he had a good brain, but unfortunately did not use the right place - he was more convinced when he saw Baldwin The idea that this human has a pair of stubborn and ambitious eyes, innocent McGee will never know what kind of master he has chosen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this owner is a bit stupid. Long in my heart, he has already said very clearly, is this Norman king not read the scrolls associated with them before? Since he decided to accept and use a group of strange people before? But thinking about this may also be a good thing. "The rune plate is the creation of the gods. I mean, at the earliest time, the gods used it to measure the fate, measure the merits, and create everything in the world." It is a treasure that cannot be touched by all things, but one day, it suddenly fell into the dirty soil, Guanghua no longer, the light is hidden, then who discovered it, wiped the dust, let it re-emerge Awesome glory? Not human, right, not dwarf, not elf, orc and giant, gnome, sire, gnome." Longer aggravated tone, "is a gnome, squat, in the sacred recovery Before their creation, we found its secrets. We let the runes spread everywhere you can see, so that ordinary people with no mana can create miracles like the gods."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin’s eyes looked at the gnome wearing a heavy amount of money in front of him, and really said that it’s so wonderful to be able to steal and plagiarize, good-looking people, good Well, even Dwarf the first time he met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ever thought about it?" Long, helpless, he has never met such a one... He said that the mind is like the seaside The hard and boring lord or king of the rock, "Gnomes can imitate any creation, even if they belonged to a powerful mage, a terrible demon, or a great deity..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long sighed, he didn’t want to say so clearly, it’s too lacking in the unique beauty of conspiracy: “You can have ten, one hundred, or A thousand runes, as long as you are willing to give them to me, we can even use steel to build towering walls on the border of Norman in the Highlands." Of course, long know that in addition to runes, this may be needed to do this. All the iron in this plane is exhausted, but it doesn't matter. He believes that Wang should understand the exaggeration that gnomes have always liked to use - as long as he can see the desire from Birdwin's eyes, then he will win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin’s heart slammed his chest, perhaps his mind, and he never thought that his mind was blank. I can't even think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the gnomes showed a smile of joy. He and his people came here under McGee’s leadership, and there was no fear, especially him. Because McGee is likely to replace him and become the leader of the gnomes, he has to do more preparations. He asked his daughter to marry McGonagall as soon as possible, so that even if McGee really became the leader of the gnomes, He also doesn't have to worry about his head going down on Norman's execution platform. What's more, he can't replace McGee's position. After all, it's not himself who is loyal to Bedwin first. Strictly speaking, He was also an enemy of Baldwin, and he didn't know how to repair the Mithril arm, but he could let the human king see that McGee could not replace his place. McGee's father was an arrogant man. The people, McGee is also, they have always dismissed the imitation, but he can, his sons can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** Curiously looked at his fiancé. And the female gnomes around her are also the same. They are surrounded by **, whispering and talking quietly, congratulations ** have a beautiful husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, **I am very happy that McGee has finally given up his whimsy, but from the results, McGee’s whimsy is not What a bad thing, if he does not leave the Dragon Fire Island, how can he get a king's friendship? Undoubtedly, this young man who was scorned and indifferent by the gnomes was bet on the bet. He now seeks not only a warm, but at least very broad and safe territory for the gnomes of the East Crown. He is this piece. The lord of the territory, with a viscount of the viscount, she will also be called the wife, she is of course satisfied, even if McGee continues to wear a greasy leather coat like a sly "squirrel", unkempt hair, with The fake beard walked around with bare feet and she could bear it, let alone, he now looks cleaner than any other gnome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
