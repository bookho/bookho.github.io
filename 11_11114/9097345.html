"Okay," Druid said. "You should go back, don't let humans see you." In this barren place, even the mole It can be regarded as a delicious food, not to mention a delicate and dense, metallic luster. Because of the thin and warm relationship, many knights and nobles are willing to use cloaks for cloaks and robes. - If you are seen by a serf or a hunter, not only its children, but even its children and wives may not be able to get a good end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I always feel that we have forgotten something." The soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Perant recalled for a while, he felt that nothing was missing, the conversion ceremony of the Lich was not completed, and it was only one after seven days. With a sad zombie, his letter eagle should have reached the Grey Ridge, and then there will be other elves trying to contact the nearest Good God pastor, asking them to deal with the follow-up - they are not necessarily there to wait for a full seven days and nights, In order to deal with a zombie, he believes that whether it is the pastor of Tell, Rosada or even Su Lun, or their believers, they will not stand by and ignore it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have anything left there?" Druid asked, after all, they were raided. If it is really important, he can summon one. The red deer or himself turned and took the caster back to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world is speechless, and he reaches out and shakes at the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant stared at his hand, his eyes solidified, and his expression turned into a state similar to "囧", with a few points Unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"McKe!" they said in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, they had to delay a half-day departure. On the morning of the next day, the druid drank a little warm water and turned into a white-headed eagle. Start. After the people in Baldwin helped the people here to have half the yard of firewood - they didn't even have an axe, because the axe was a property, and long before the adventurer arrived, the axe was charged as a higher tax. After they were taken away, they could only use their sharp stones or hands-on methods to prepare themselves for the fuel they needed in winter. When Baldwin decided to cut a tree, they stopped it with fear. Because trees are also the property of the lords, as long as they have fallen leaves, they will do it. Of course, this is a kindly lie. Baldwin was once a hunter. He knows that he has to live through such a long winter. How much firewood is there. "I have a gold coin here." Birdwin said: "If someone punishes you on this charge, you can use it as a fine."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he wondered if there would still be someone to investigate whether these serfs really cut a tree. Lev and his wife could not appear here again. The former has turned into nothingness, while the latter went to pain and remorse. Mourning the wasteland - just don't know if she can still hear the voice of God. Since she has fallen, the devil will come with the smell of evil. Birdwin has no doubt at all. This has spent a lifetime in lies. The old woman may not have been able to leave a complete footprint, and she will be dragged into another desperate and desperate field - wait until the pastor cleans up, confirm the death of Lev and his wife, inform the Dagong, Waiting for seven days or more, as for the person who will come back to recover this territory, whether it is Dagong’s son or nephew, he may prefer to stay in a warm room until the winter passes, and by that time, all Traces will be enchanted by snow and time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the wheat in the field grows, the gold coin he left can exchange enough food and salt for these poor people so that they don’t After getting rid of a gray robe lord, they still have to face the threat of hunger and cold. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they and the serfs, together with the bonfire and the sweet potato baked (these sweet potatoes or the gift of the elf), the pygmy Mackey hangs in the white head The eagle's claws swayed underneath, and the hands and feet came back stiffly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is as soft as a bag of grain, or a ripe berry on a thick snow, without being hurt a little It’s just that the eyes are straight and the words and deeds are sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant returned to its original appearance, lifted the gnome, placed it next to the campfire, and then took a hot cup of honey from the lich’s hand. Into the small hands of McGee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About when they are about to eat the sweet potato, the gnome finally moved and took a long breath: "The gods are on." He used The little, sad voice said: "I thought I had to stay in the crack for several years," he looked at the sweet potato that Leona handed him over, put down the cup, and took it bite. Take a sip: "You...you...can't imagine it," he sobbed, and miraculously did not prevent him from drinking honey and eating sweet potatoes. "I... I was set in a gap." Yes, ... a few hundred feet from the ground, I... I can’t move at all, I don’t dare... move... There are bugs crawling on me, drilling... drilling into my nose, In the ear, if I didn't close my eyes," he seemed to have finally slowed down and his speech became smooth: "They may have been in my eyes..." He paused twitching. For a moment: "And... that damn bird," he glanced cautiously at the druid, wisely not adding How bad adjective: "It feed me, feed me ......" <br <br /> & nbsp />; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"Oh, maybe because it thinks you are hungry?" Leona said a little nervously, she also forgot one of the gnomes McGee, think about him hanging on the cliff for nearly a day and a night, she must He showed his deepest apology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it feeds my intestines, intestines, intestines!" The gnome screamed: "The intestines of the sheep, I saw it carrying a lamb up!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That," Druid said: "The intestines can also be said to be quite good foods." Especially for the carvings, it may be because The pygmy McGee can also be regarded as a guest, so the eagle as a master is quite generous and kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But there are feces! Yellow, soft, stinky feces!" The gnome then shouted: "I can't even refuse!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The...the eagle is sometimes very stubborn, Perant thinks, maybe next time he should change a friend, for example... how about a fox? The internal organs are the favorite of the fox, then McGee may get a fur-covered head, but at least there will be no feces in his head - he noticed that Gülen and others have already put down the sweet potato that has not been eaten yet. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...you have solved that...what?" The gnome calmed down more quickly than his companion, his little hand flexingly The branch of sweet potato: "What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An evil gray robe," Birdwin replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are countless mummies, corpses, gargoyles and zombies." Gülen said, please allow him to exaggerate, look, and work well. The gnome's emotions are no longer so bad. He even reveals a reassuring look. Obviously, for a gnome, compared to a necromancer with countless undead entourages, a eagle, and a sculpt for him. The choice of temporary homes, as well as the intestines of sheep with soft feces, are not so unbearable at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you tell me?" McGee eagerly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Kerry said kindly: "But you seem to need to sleep better."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mckey hesitated for a while, his spirit is still a little excited because of nausea and fear, but he also knows that he really needs a rest; "Okay, if you can." He looked forward eagerly The mud house, the house of the serfs, was not even glanced at McGee, but now it seems that they are not too bad - after all, these serfs have long lost the animals that were raised in the mud house. Because of the lack of food, they dry up like a stubborn remnant of life and skin. In order to keep them cold, they get mud, thick like a pig, so that even if they lack clothes and firewood, they Can be a bit obscured - this makes their stench slightly lighter, and the mud house is low, small, dark, but they also carry fur, McGee can sleep comfortably. It’s just that he doesn’t know if this will affect the next trip, but since the companions say so, he’s only respectful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gnomes went to sleep, the adventurers around the bonfire were obviously relieved. The elves were obviously awkward, and Leona couldn’t help but laugh. She knew it was wrong, but many things were It’s not that you can control it if you don’t think it’s right, and then you laugh at the unscrupulous smile. “Maybe we can carry him on the back,” Baldwin suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If that's a calm trip, of course." Perant said: "But if we need to fight." He raised his hands and made a few gestures. With a rich experience in combat, Birdwin suddenly understood what he meant. Druid said yes, if in battle, the gnome is likely to become his carapace, not to become a full plug. The hedgehog of the arrow is dead because it broke the neck or broke the spine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are concerned that the gnome is too weak to fight," the savage said suddenly: "Why don't try to let him learn to fight." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he is a gnome." Leona said without thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I know, not every gnome is fragile and useless." The lich looks at Gülen: "Every thief guild will have gnomes "The figure is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grand nodded: "Yes, but..." In general, the gnomes in the thieves' union are still more used in the configuration. Trap and making bows and other instruments, they are rarely used for assassinations and raids, although at some point, in order to cater to some monsters that like young children, some people try to use gnomes, but they are not If the price is too high, it will give up the task for various reasons (sometimes just because you came across a dead mouse that they think is unlucky), and the frequency of death and injury is high, compared to the benefits of their exquisite craftsmanship. It is simply not worth the candle, so in the end the thieves guilds would rather choose the human child they were collecting in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not that there is no eccentric gnome who is willing to taste the danger and bloody taste. He knows that there is a female gnome, she is called a little monster. Because her appearance is like the most beautiful and flawless pearl, the soul is like being soaked in the most evil mud. Her favorite is to assassinate those good people. When they see the helpless children, they are full. When I kindly approached the inquiry, even when she was in her arms, she probably wouldn’t have thought of a delicate dagger piercing her throat or heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is our companion, not a clown, nor a cumbersome." The Lich said that even this time, Leona began to seriously think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This may be my fault," Perant admitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many people make mistakes." The Lich said softly: "A very normal mistake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you don't have to blame yourself for this." Leona said: "Even if McGee really needs to learn how to fight for his life and conviction, it needs to be gradual - first, he must at least know how to Protect yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He may have learned how to get along with a eagle." Gülen said: "A great improvement."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He seems to have wanted to be a heroic dwarf." Birdwin said: "I think we can really try it. A heroic dwarf still deserves our admiration. Appreciate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry looked at the black hair caster, the lich smiled at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s see an episode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I always feel that we have forgotten something."
