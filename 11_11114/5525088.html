			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry thought that the caster would immediately leave the place where he was grayed out, but he walked away without disappointment, or casually Point something to the boy who had no hands and feet - he bought light wine, bread and salted fish from the vendor, then sat there and watched the boy full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does he have a parent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a boy chews a loaf of light wine He quietly asked Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Kerry Ben said: "And they love this child very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kreima looked at Kerry Ben, and the Elf Ranger could almost see the words "Impossible!" from his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The children here have to find their own food as long as they can go," said Kerry Ben. "Not every day, people like you are willing to give He has bread and light wine, he is still alive, someone must have given him food, and there is a place to sleep, but even if he can grow up, he can't work, he will die sooner or later, and the things he eats will be wasted. Off - for them, this is stupid, stupid enough to kill them, so I said that his parents love him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you Look at his body," the elf continued. "The dirt didn't get into pieces, someone gave him a shave, and some of his hair was cut for him. Most importantly," he signaled to Kremar to observe around. "There are only A disabled child, a child who is alive and alive, but do you think that this low-lying tool will only appear once in Beitburg?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kreima’s pupil is black without a trace of light – only when it’s very close, you can Separate color of the iris area - it made a sudden contraction, shrinking very small, small like a quill on parchment falling a little something, undoubtedly represent the horror and hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rogues buy them from their parents' parents at a cheap price, when free orphans are not enough - this transaction does not violate the Biyin In the law of the fort, the child is the property of the parents.” The Ranger looked at the child again: “The criminals who have been shackled will be expelled from Bibi Dibao. They have waited for a day or two to make sure no one wants him. Take him back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy only ate a piece of bread that was no bigger than his fist. Krimall bought a piece of linen worth more than the food and wrapped the rest of the food around his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy looks at him and lifts his bare wrists more than on the forehead. If he has a hand, it is a simple greeting, he has no fingers, no With a gesture of gratitude, Kreima didn't want to know why he didn't use his tongue—perhaps it was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they walked away, a big girl immediately ran over and took off the parcel from the docile boy’s neck, and she ran to a tilted tent. The children’s eyes follow her. The boy stayed alone in the ground, with sand on his body. He climbed with his elbows and knees to continue his previous work - using a residual limb to dig shells and sandworms in a clumsy and slow way, grabbing with his mouth they. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" The speller confusely asked: "...Since they love him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "There is no residence, surname, blood, property, no appearance, no strong body," Kerry said quietly: "Becoming a thief is the only chance for these children and their parents to get ahead - it is an evil mean. Occupation, but it can bring money and status."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are only a handful of members who can become full members."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every child thinks he can be one of the few," said the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman who couldn’t tell the age came out of the tent. She was holding a few large sea otters leaves and went to the boy to pick up his sand. The worm, touching the boy's head with the hand covered with sand, the boy laughed, carefree, with the mucus of the sandworm on the corner of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar's throat is in a tight position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What kind of world is this? Kerry Ben."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One does not It’s too good,” said the Elf Ranger: “But it’s not too bad.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near the dusk, the entire tourmaline has become hot and humid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar accepted the invitation of Alva and lived in a cool and safe smog hut with Kerry Ben, and he still had three before the night finally came. After copying the last reel, the lich left him with the spells he needed to copy, two magic missiles, one electric claw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a mage, the smog hut is much more lovely than the egret's feet. There are not only the servants who are attentive to the service, but also the work of the mage. A variety of well-designed appliances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a ebony winged magical monster in the corner of the wall, and the hands of the claws are holding the colorless fluorite as a fist. This is rare. The white light emitted by the expensive ore is soft and bright enough to illuminate the entire room. It does not generate heat and black smoke like oil lamps or candles, and does not burn and contaminate precious books. It is the most favored by the mages. Lighting fixtures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next to the ebony statue is a mica stone low table carved into the head of a giant, with the adult man’s elbows on the skull. A delicate silver boat filled with myrrh and sandalwood powder, a small bird-shaped silver incense burner suffocates at the bow of the boat, its wings can be opened and put into the spice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant's sparse teeth spurt out the fresh water carrying the fresh air, falling into his prominent lower lip - a deep concave stone plate, the blisters burst, The water circling a small hole that flows into the center of the stone plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large bed is a black silk blanket with adult male hands open and unable to touch the edge, Mithril line, and perhaps other Things are interwoven into a miniature star map that changes position and color every day with the real stars in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the bed and silk carpet, there are huge windows, double-glazed, even in the Beitburg, this is a very extravagant move, but It is a good way to ensure the silence that the Master needs to meditate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a specially designed beveled desk for the wizard to copy the scrolls. It is walnut, smooth, hard, uniform in color, and the angle of the table is tilted inward. It allows the writer's feather pen to form a 90-degree angle with the paper so that the arm does not smudge or wrinkle valuable paper, and the slanted tabletop can be used to store paper and ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before buying reel paper, the souls of the outer world never knew that there were so many animal skins, common goatskin, sheep skin, pig skin, calfskin and tread paper, rare deer paper, velvet paper and swamp snake paper. There may be, but only sold to the credible buyer's paper, fisherman paper (that is, those who were wasted by him), as for the devil paper and the devil paper, it is basically produced by the mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell book they got from the thief Glan was a very common goat paper, carefully applied a thin layer after the copying method. Oil wax, copying scroll can not use this kind of parchment which only removes the epidermis and endothelium, without special treatment. This kind of paper is so tough that it can't be torn at once. The scroll made with it can't be used at all - copying the scroll The paper is either a goat skin with only a layer of mesh skin, or a fetal skin – a paper made from the skin of a natural or artificially ill calf, soaked in a special potion, they are light and white. Smooth, thin enough to see the texture of walnut through it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s very difficult to copy with this kind of paper, it’s too fragile, can’t stand the scraping of the scraper, and it’s a bit of a small piece of paper. Scrap, and the way that scribes like to use the scraper to crush the fixed paper can not be used, you can not use a metal pen to drill a hole in the hole, the scroll can only leave lines and strokes for the flow of magic energy. A small hole can make a spell disappear or distort - the reason why the ramp table used by the wizard is extraordinarily expensive, perhaps because it has a steel slide on each of its left and right sides, which can be used for measurement and for fixing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ink used for copying spells also needs to be modulated according to the spell. Because of the relationship between the sea and the sea, the ink sold in the ink is purified by the ink of the big inkfish. For the main material, add delicate flying fish gelatin, and then mix a certain amount of pine charcoal powder. Nobility and merchants like to add spices to the ink, and the wizards need to add secret silver powder, fine gold powder and gem powder according to the type of copying spells. The blood of the creature (including the blood of the dragon and the devil, the blood of the devil), etc., the ink used in the magic missile scroll is added with one gram of secret silver powder, and the electric claw reel requires half a gram of fine gold powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world at first thought that copying the scroll is like copying the English word, copying the spell in memory directly to the parchment, and then knowing The scrolls not only include the spells you need to cast, but also the gestures you need to cast when you cast them - it's a set of beautifully detailed graphics on the reels, thanks to this brand new body, with its arms and fingers When drawing a circle, it is like a perfect compass. When drawing an arc, it is like a qualified cloud ruler. When the corner is folded, it is the standard triangle ruler. When you approve the angle and size, you still need to use it. A secret silver pendulum will shake and hum when it finds a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
