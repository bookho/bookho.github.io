			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give me the piano," Ann said, "And the book I am reading."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one of her personal maids went to take her the piano and the book, the other maid opened the window and laid a soft, thick white bear fur on the single armchair under the window. It is covered with a dark red jacquard thin cushion with silver beads and a black embroidered gold lily cushion filled with velvet hair. This chair is very special. It is raised, with two steps, very wide. It is enough for the petite girl lord to lift her feet and curl it completely inside - without hindering her from watching the scenery outside the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smog when the house was burned out has dissipated, the blood has been washed away by the rain, and people on the streets are rushing, even though they are still wearing black clothes, grief It has not completely disappeared from the eyes, but the dead have been buried, and the living of the living will continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cool and fresh wind stroking the inner sanctuary of Rosada, bringing a vaguely audible prayer and humming - the priest is coming The trial also came to restore honor and trust. He brought twelve powerful pastors who had held three mourning ceremonies for the unfortunate dead, as well as purification rituals for the entire sanctuary, inside and outside the Holy of Holies. They will change places to rebuild the holy pool and use the silver that identifies poison and evil to make a ditch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the people in White Tower are still reluctant to approach the sanctuary, but there are also some people who have unfortunately been hurt in that terrible night and have to seek the help of the pastor. In addition to some of the original dysentery and missing limbs, their wounds have been well treated and cared for. Although Anzhen has not observed them at the entrance of the sanctuary, she knows that as time goes by, the memory fades. The glory of Sada will return to people's hearts - or, it has never left, Demon has come to her with anger, asking her to sign a stack of arrest warrants, because those stupid people have forgotten The sinners of Rosada gave them the pain, ignoring the intent of the lord and the consul, and giving them food and clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not surprising to this, and the sanctuary of Rosada has stood for nearly a thousand years since the White Tower, and in this long period of time, Luo The Baita people who had been treated by Pastor’s pastor were countless. They even worked together to resist two plagues that almost looted the hills. If the most important crime was not washed away, the White Tower’s The anger may still burn for a while, but after the former servants of Rosada became "victims", the hatred of the people was no longer so strong - especially those pastors who were abandoned by their gods and sentenced Exile, branding, and trembling in the rain of the night, some people who have received their favor will inevitably have some pity, although they will not object to the judgment of the lord and forget the pain of losing family and friends, but ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid's whispered call interrupted An Zhen's thoughts. She brought the piano and the book. Anzhen just glanced at it and asked her to take the piano for another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't sit in Sitara," that is the piano of the elf: "Change the ukulele or the Solitaire." The latter two are human harps - —Anzhen looked around and asked her maid to take away a few ornaments or silk carpets that were clearly out of the hands of the elves: “Get the necklace of whales again.” The maid hesitated because she knew herself. The owner never likes to hang a part of the animal's body on his neck or wear it on his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Demon walked into the room of Anzhen, he didn’t see anything unsightly. He saw An Zhen sitting in the chair he specially customized for her. Inside, as he fanned, a bird with a golden feather docilely hangs in its luxurious and comfortable nest, and her neck is hung with a whale-corner necklace that he sent yesterday, which is a narwhal horn. Made of the most clean and snowy part, it can detoxify and eliminate heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned down happily, kissed the girl’s finger, and then her cheek, her cheeks were as soft and delicate as roses: “I I really hope that today is the day we get married." He whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wedding of a lord can't be so negligent," said An Zhen. "It's great to be able to finish all the preparations before the holy day of Jammu. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I really want you to give birth to our children as soon as possible," Demon said arrogantly, his hand slipped from the chest of the ampoule. To her lower abdomen: "You have to give birth to a son for me. The blood of St. Regis split 50 years ago, and now they can finally be combined again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen hopes that Demon did not notice her momentary stiffness, she extended her arm, hugged his neck, hid her face: "I said the lord is not me," she sighed The voice said: "It's you. My dear cousin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not the lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the difference," said An Zhen, her vocal cords shaking with a minimum of amplitude: "I am your wife, everything is yours, yours, yours." She said the While blinking eyes, because she like to see what things should not appear here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right." Demon had nothing to do with it, or his attention was all attracted to another kind of **. He pulled the arm of the ampoule and kissed her lips wildly, his Lips and tongue are not suitable for kissing, lips are thin, and the tongue is covered with thick tongue coating and bitter mucus, but the ampoule's lips are like the first ripe cherries, the mouth is full of honey aroma, he just kisses at first, but As the desire grows, his kiss gradually turns into a beast-like bite. His teeth are deeply embedded in the lips of the ampoule, just like chewing and swallowing it. His tongue is like a wild dog. Taking her throat, let her breathe hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahn found that she was being pushed to the chair, she screamed, and her maid immediately rushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon can almost be said to have violently pushed the ampoule out, let her fall on the chair, and glared at the fact that he did not follow him. The maid of the order, and the maid immediately slammed down and pressed her hands against the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An芮 made a deep breath: "Go out," she said to the maid: "Nothing, I just accidentally sat down on my book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demon’s fingers twitched softly, he wanted to cast a spell, a spell about burning or splitting, but he changed his mind, Easy to work, the maid's hair was raised high, revealing her slender and white neck, maybe a better way of punishment, the Master thought, his eyes turned back to Anzhen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen reveals an innocent, poor smile: "Sorry... Demon," she bit her lip bite, her lips It was torn, and the blood made her lips more beautiful. "But I think, you must look forward to a perfect wedding night like me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Should be sorry for me," Demon said. "Your fault is that you are too beautiful," he shook his head. "I should still let them try to get married in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen’s back behind her grabbed the cushion, and her body unconsciously moved into the book she used as an excuse for the book from the gap between the chairs Dropped down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What book are you reading?" Demon asked, picking up the book and frowning when he saw the cover. "I don't want to." Seeing this again, An Zhen, as my wife, books, especially this inferior manuscript, is completely incompatible with your identity. In fact, I think that your future life should be more practical and peaceful. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a book that describes a powerful mage," said An Zhen, who grabbed her silk gown and showed a shy look: "A powerful, great, incomparable mage, eventually became a respect. The glory and wealthy king... Demon, I think he is - much like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon tried to hide his smile and smug, but failed He hid the book in his sleeve. "If it is just because of this, I will forgive you." He proudly said that he was close to the ampoule and kissed her neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is nothing else," he said: "I have to go back to my bureau to handle the documents. They are now paying for everything in the hills." "Let me manage it," he said angrily. "Are you going to call them and tell them that I am just the White Tower's consul?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will tell them the rights you have," said An Zhen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Demon was about to leave the room, An Zhen suddenly stopped him: "There is something to tell you." She patted her head. "Almost forgot." She folded her hands on her knees and sat upright: "Dome, my brother, I have a message about Yadel..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demon hurried away, the maids remained outside the door, and the silent room suddenly remembered the cunning voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miao! Wonderful!" said a voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little devil appeared in front of An Zhen, suspended in the air, its wings sticking out to the sides, flapping like a bat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen turned around without incident, as if he didn’t see it and didn’t hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you saw me." Asmodeos said that it flaps its wings and rotates back to the opposite side of the ampoule. Position - without warning, its tail screamed out of the body, the black thorns, dripping venom, and the elves couldn't capture the speed of the ampoule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen does not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stinger stops when there is only one piece of paper in the eyes of Ampoule, Asmodeos notices that the female half-elf's pupil is not even shrink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
