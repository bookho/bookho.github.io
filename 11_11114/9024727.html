The mage who combed a silvery hair neatly behind his head was not too disappointed. These people have been separated and are facing strong opponents. What he has to be warned is whether the young caster in front of him will use the spell to escape the highland. The rewards on the face of Norman New King are only Bydwin, Gülen. With the name of plum, but in the dark, the name of the elf game Kerry Ben and the half-elf mage Kremar is also juxtaposed. If there is any difference, it is that the new king hopes that the latter two are captured instead of Killed, this also led to the older wizard must choose some more gentle spells, but the magic is always cruel, one of the simplest tricks can also be put to death, public opinion and face an ominous half of life The elf is better than Kerry, and the Ranger has not encountered danger in his nearly two hundred years of adventure, but there is no room for the orcs to talk to the elves. Another kind of goblin, giant, or unscrupulous devil and demons, other creatures, especially humans, will always hesitate to hesitate when facing a crown prince, because everyone knows a country. The power will be terrible, although the concept of class between the upper and lower elves are not like humans so strong, but they also have a king, and this is the king of Kerry's Silver Crown forests only child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he misses and kills Kerry Ben, the wizard is not sure if his guild will hand him over to the furious elf army, he is The status in the guild is not low, but it is not high enough to be maintained by a guild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening wind picked up the black and white robes of the black caster, revealing his reel belt, and the older mage quickly repeated the half-elf mage today. Used spells. The group of two-legged gnome dragons were tempted by them, but they did not expect that this young mage would think of how to make good use of everything that can be used in such a short period of time rather than like those who are inexperienced. Such a savage and stubbornly throwing his own spells, then his disciples had to deliberately made some extremely low-level mistakes to consume the spells remembered by this young mage. Yes, how can a mage who works with his mentor for a large guild that is assassinated as a guild will make mistakes that even apprentices will not make? Even the mercenaries who were "mistaken" by his spells were only hired by them to hide their trash, but none of them were injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought, estimated, but these time he did not stupidly stay in the same place, but like a sparrow eagle rushed to the high-altitude two opposing wizards It is definitely not a mistake to occupy a higher position when you choose to cast an aerospace first. After all, this continent has the same gravity as the Earth, and the flight will disappear in a while, and for a wizard, even a spit out of a syllable can also mean a brilliant victory. There is also a part of the spell, no doubt, just like an arrow shot, when you stand down and throw it down, you can exert its maximum strength and clearly see the enemy's every move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he looked down, he suddenly fell into a cold, and decades of experience saved him once. He didn't think about the underground crash. A hot flame beam pierced from behind him. If he was still in his original position, he might Burnt into a darkened donut. The mage looked angry and horrified at the direction of the spell. He saw his enemies. If he was like a sparrow hawk, his enemies were like a giant hummingbird, a black-haired spellcaster. The way is more elegant and elegant than him, without the clumsiness of the human beings. He looks down at the caster who looks at him from the outside, calmly and calmly makes a spelling gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to me!" the old wizard shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Kremar said that a beam of lightning came out of his hand, and the dazzling light was like a star from the black swamp. The lieutenant rises, and the old wizard is completely swallowed up in a flash. No, the lich does not hear the sorrowful sorrow that the soul must inevitably leave the body, manipulating the body of the alien soul in his command. Changed his position, a few shadow-like translucent tentacles entangled in an empty space, entangled into a useless ball in the moonlight, and the dark gray sphere is his enemy, he is casting a second The spell points the thin middle finger to the soul of the alien world, but the strange seems to have no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," said the older mage, who described it as a little embarrassed. He removed himself a distance, but was still smashed by the huge lightning. And some of them, "You didn't put those scrolls around." He showed a cold smile to Kremar: "It seems that you found it very early." If you didn't trust them at all, there was no cast. Those who use the moments that can be used to save themselves and their companions will be left behind rather than carried around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They do pretend to be very clever." Kreima admits, unfortunately, but the lich lost his beloved bone shelf and surging among them. The negative energy, but the knowledge, memory and experience are still intact, he did not take much effort to identify the trap: "just like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It also cost a lot." The older mage watched him say that the reels could sell tens of thousands of gold coins under the operation of the guild, and the identity of the car owner is true. He is indeed a businessman. It is also a little bit to do with the Alva Master of Bituminburg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***(Changed in one hour)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is unfortunate that the prey did not slack off as they hoped, and even might be tempted to fall into a sweet sleep, but the wizard who neatly combed a silver hair to the back of the brain did not Too disappointed.
