			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone is willing to mold a worldly image of a changeable destiny, then this person at our feet, this ridiculous thief, falls Can be a pretty good template. ——by a once undead person<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince’s confidant knight looks gloomy, He took a deep breath and suppressed his anger—in any case, here is Thunder, and it is not a smart thing to do a conflict with a ruler where a lord is the law: “If You insist on this," he stroked the hilt inlaid with emeralds and rubies: "Grandpa..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words were interrupted, not being Who is the key to his position with Birdwin, the thief who died, but not because the latter said something, but after he stood up under the support of two knights, there was no warning. The ground fell down - a knight lowered his knees, squatted down, turned him over, face up, and the lucky man seemed to have lost consciousness, his limbs were soft, his face was white, his lips Also with a smug smile, but the black pupil has been magnified many times<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight around him took his dagger and put the cold and sharp blade under the prisoner’s nose. After a while he looked up and confused. Inexplicably returning: "German," he said: "He is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, this can solve everything," Prince The confidant knight sneered at the corner of his mouth: "Gregory, everything you have done is turned into a vain - along with this despicable thief - your kindness, your tolerance and justice, all buried in the earth Going inside - do you want to hold a funeral for him? This way I can describe it more in detail when I return to my Highness, and the Prince will definitely laugh at it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin touched his beard reluctantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich stood up and approached the thief’s body, right, not the corpse, as a familiar and good at using the death of the caster, he did not hear the way to the mourning wilderness The open door of the door did not feel the cold wind blowing from the door - although it was indeed a cold breath that oozes from the body that seems to be thin and weaker than anyone else. The deceased walked around his spread hands and walked half a circle: "No," he said interestingly: "He is not dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he no longer breathes," said the knight who inserted the dagger into the sheath. Then he placed his hand under the thief's chest. "His heart is no longer beating," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave away from him." The lich said rudely: "He was cursed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The knight hesitated and immediately stood up - a friend who is a friend of the enemy, if you are willing to say something, you should be able to listen carefully and follow his words, this is the Knight of Thunder Castle Long-term experience with the caster to accumulate experience. His choice is correct, because the thief's body is changing at a speed visible to the naked eye - it is shrinking, splitting, and smashing at a hundredfold speed. The skin, internal organs, blood and hair instantly turned into a pile of fine crimson dust, leaving only dry muscles and twisted bones. The Lich made a gesture and removed the armor to make him more detailed. Observing the changes, this action raises those...dust, and Baldwin and others unconsciously rush back, lest they get contaminated with things that are uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small part of them fluttered in the sun, and more piled up around the neatly arranged white bones, in addition to the color, looks and There is no difference in ordinary dust. People who don't know the inside may think that a careless maid accidentally overturned a common and dull rouge powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?" asked the Cavaliers from Wangdu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait," said the Lich: "If this is the curse I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "They are moving." A knight said with horror and disgust - the dust is slowly gathering together, albeit slowly, but with human eyes they can fully capture their movement: "Is this or not? What about the deceased?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the contrary," the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust re-converges into a thin red shadow on the slate ground rendered by the sunlight, but it lasts for a long time, just like before After a short period of time was reversed, the deprived things returned to his body again, and people again saw the thief who was forgiven by Birdwin, who lay naked on the ground, intact. He opened his eyes after several heavy and difficult breathings. At first they were painful and confused, but very quickly, the vulgarity and cruelty of a sophisticated thief occupies the brown eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the caster in a black robe, the root of all the disasters - the Master looked at him condescendingly, and the black eyes that had appeared numerous times in the nightmare of the thief were looking at his body without scorn, thieves Gülen is not ugly. On the contrary, he has a face that will make those ignorant girls sway, although men will think that this face is too feminine. After all, Gülen inherited his mother, the face of a Fro priest—his eyes are narrow, his eyes are high, his nose is narrow and pointed, and his mouth is slightly upturned, like a smiling mask anytime, anywhere. - Although as a prisoner, he has no right and no chance to touch the razor, the thick beard covers his small half face, but still can not completely cover the innate strange attraction - he The hair is pruned very shortly in the port of Point, after all, a thief is not suitable for some of the aristocrats who love to be as tired and dragging, long hair that is difficult to manage, and now they have grown to the shoulder position, and formed a number Curved soft brown swirls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief’s body is pale and slender, but not weak, his strength is hidden as carefully as his muscles, his chest is lower left There is a big scar, shaped like a hand bone, and the hand bone is holding it like it is holding his heart tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the curse of the god of death," said the Lich: "You killed a priest of the god of death, this is his revenge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the best painter and sculptor can’t redraw and sculpt Gülen’s look, if he turns into a beast in the next moment, will be in front of him It is not surprising that the people shredded and then swallowed each piece of meat and bones, and it was not surprising that the blood dropped on the ground. The knights immediately stepped forward and pulled out the sword to point to the heart of the dead and resurrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin waved his hand tiredly, and his knights immediately stepped forward, and the shackles and collars that had been taken off the moment before were put back in Glan’s Hands, feet and neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I killed the orc." The thief said that the voice was not loud, but the sharpness was unusual and stabbed in Bedwin’s ear: "I should be pardoned." Self-righteous Tyre Knight - I killed the orc!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin fell back to his chair, he rubbed his forehead, wrinkled With his eyebrows, fortunately his knight has always been known for his agility, Gülen was dragged out, and his voice was immediately isolated by heavy wooden doors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," said the prince’s knight, "I thought you would insist - even if the poor worm you wanted to forgive once killed a priest, The service of the god of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
