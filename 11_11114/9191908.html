			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bloody battle of the bottomless abyss is about to begin," Tyre roared. "I don't think we should waste time here!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his friends and allies, the god of suffering, the crying god Ilmoth, and the Lord of the Morning, Rosada, are silent, their attitudes make justice and justice The god Taier could not leave, even though he did not want to come here at first. This is a broken meeting of the gods. In the hall of the sky, every god can only see the architecture and decoration that he imagined. Tyre sees the majestic gray stone building, made with black iron. The lamp holder and the decoration, the soft copper letters are engraved on the wall with all the provisions concerning the law, and the balance of the black iron is suspended on the large altar. One is justice and the other is evil. Now they are unlimited. Tilt to the evil side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosada sees the vast temple and sanctuary of Alabaster, the sun flows into the room from the zenith of the glass, making it bright and clear both inside and outside. The clean water is warm in the sun, the laurel tree shadows, the tree is covered with tasseled cushions - the god of suffering, the crying god Ilmotte can only perceive the rancid that others can't stand. Breath, they come from the patient's vomit or the wounded ulcer's wound, mixed with the pungent smell of the herbs, he sits on the ground, there is only dirt, maybe a little straw, and his body constantly appears new wounds, just like him Committed to the disaster for those who are unfortunate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the period from the beginning of the bloody battle between the devil and the devil, to the end (temporary end), all the gods, and the neutral gods, even some The evil spirits must be prepared. The scope of the blood war is not limited to the bottomless abyss or the nine layers of hell. They can happen anywhere the devil and the devil can reach, and these mixed balls often start to attack with the same intentions. The former kingdom of the gods is also a plane. After several turbulences, even the softest gods will take the most severe and profound attitude towards the bloody battle. At this time, as the three gods in the good deities, Tyre, Ilmot and Rosada should be on the weak defense line, but the god of conspiracy and disputes called for the meeting of the gods, even Tyre. The key to this is that this is also set by the god God Aiou. One of the requirements of the gods, they can not ignore the meetings of the gods, or even follow the decisions or acceptances made at the meeting. Judgment results - irrelevant gods can be withdrawn or ignored, but the gods associated with them must still be in agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly, don't worry, my friend." Ilmot said that the relationship between the three gods is a bit like Baldwin, Kerry. There is even a little friction between this and Kremar, between Tyre and Rosada. The reason why they formed an alliance is because Ilmot is also a respected friend of Rosada and Tell. "The time has not yet been agreed. Come, if," he said: "If they can't be on time, then we can leave immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My worry is when we stay here The despicable 希瑞克 will do things that are harmful to my followers. "Before Sirrick did not do anything, try to hold a god, and then pretend that his image came to the other's temple to issue a will. To provoke the sacred war, the number of gods involved can be more than three. When they rush to arrive, they can only return a bit of old blood on their chests - can they blame the believers? Of course not; can you blame the other side of the war? No, even rabbits will fight back when they are hurt; can you blame Hirik? No, because Shirek’s priesthood is conspiracy and disputes. This is his job, not a crime. In the end, they found that there is no alternative to blaming themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just as this sentence has just dissipated in the air, a concealed and embarrassing force has been invested in the meeting center of the gods, and the smoke rises from the ground. From there, a woman dressed in a black tight dress, her skin pale, her fingers slender, all from the knees down in the shadow of the shadow, "the thief god Mask." Tyre said disgusted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Morning casts a sardonic look, and the thief god Mask has tried to use the thief who used to be a mortal to steal the priesthood and divine power is already well known. The secret is that, after he failed, he became a vassal of Cherik without any shame. Although as a god, he would not be stupid enough to deliver everything, but with Shire. When he was coexisting, he was cautious, or humbled to appear as a female, or would make the gods feel ashamed - the gods almost all have the embodiment of men and women, but Masque is only because of Shire Gram often appears as a male thief, so that he has trouble with the narrow conspiracy and disputes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, followed by Shirek, the god of conspiracy and disputes, his arrival allowed Tell to see him being thrown into God forever by God. Black hole that could not be taken out; Rosada saw his temple collapse, the dying priest humiliatedly begged for a living; Ilmot’s ear screamed unwillingly, which was not able to be him The human being pacified by the priest was issued on the verge of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are coming from your invitation."The Lord of the Morning Talks disgustedly said: "If there is such a meeting, then raise your questions as soon as possible. The bloody battle is imminent, and spending time unnecessarily here will only make our anger superimposed like a Thunder - even for you. In terms of Kay luxury, you don’t want to endure their baptism."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kau Luxury may want to say something, but he was immediately stopped by Chirac. "This is exactly what we think."He asked bluntly: "Who took the essence of the nine-faced dragon god Aiou?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;In fact, the Tower of the Storm, like the other buildings in Zelata, is connected to a barren half-plane after a long, dark ramp.In addition to the mud, the mud is swampy, hurricanes, rainstorms and lightning rule this place - only a handful of sporadic buildings stand here, they are narrow and cold, but stand outside without any cover to meet the storm and lightning. The new people in the bloody battle will of course choose to hide in it and take a breather.But as every demon likes, the number of buildings is far from enough to accommodate everyone. Some people are more willing to be alone, and the resulting battles and killings happen all the time, but this is happening. It is the style of the bottomless abyss. As a wise man said, the ratio of bloody battle to civil war is always one to one hundred. He said that in the bloody battle, a demon is killed, so one hundred devils must have died in the civil war.This sentence is too much, so the greatly moved demons managed to get him into the bottomless abyss, dragging his tongue and nailing it on a stone, and each passing demonic is happy to grind it. Grind your own sword<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also some smart newcomers who are not close to those buildings. Lightning and heavy rain are terrible, but they are nothing compared to the latent crisis. Just when they see a warm glow in a building, they still can’t help cursing<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire element spider burned, only a few breaths of time, the wet ground became dry, and then quickly, the cold in the building Was driven out - this is a rough building, the only thing worthy of praise is that it is built of stone with a length and width of more than 20 feet. The three sides are the walls and the ceiling is the top. Without the use of stone bricks or clay, it means there will be no gaps, but if you look closely, you can see ominous dark traces in every subtle corner, as well as traces of snow and flames, even The scratches and impact marks left by the metal weapons are also clearly visible.The souls of the outer world have studied for a while and returned to their original positions. Their current body does not cause problems due to cold or heat, but it still likes the feeling of warmth and warmth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is not enough to be embarrassing, then an obsidian bowl on the fire element is probably enough to be crazy, it is full The water purified by the clean water ball - in the bottomless abyss, the heavy rain also carries toxins and terrible acid, rolling in the water about ten eggs, the eggshell is black, translucent, as for Where did the eggs come from? The half of the stag spider that was placed at the door to stop the rainstorm probably explained the problem. Poor lady, it was not only taken away from home, but also opened and taken away. The child, the carapace is used as a barrier for the perpetrator. Her long feet are pulled down, the poisonous body fluid is drained, and it is directly placed in the flame. At this time, the fat flavor has been unstoppable and spread to the full hundred. Far away<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the devil, swallowing the same kind has always been a wonderful way to quickly increase strength, but at this time, they can’t help but feel guilty - really should be those Pastors of the Good Gods come to see if these humans really need their protection? If you bring a scroll, a rune, a knife and fork, no, a sword, and a fire elemental creature, if you have the original words, then what about pepper, salt, fennel, sage, and mayo? Explanation? Used to captivate the enemy's mouth, no, eyes? The owner of the Tower of the Storm, the face of a Barlow demon is stiff. This idiot is just a picnic. Come and have a picnic. In order to save the little dignity, he summoned more demon. Spider, but was rejected by the demon spiders - in the bloody battle, or after being summoned in the main material plane, it is one thing to die, but for the one who finished the spider egg and licked the spider's foot, it was still unfinished. What do you guys who are standing at the door and screaming at the boundless rain curtain? Unless Barlows can be sure that he will not take any devil for dinner, of course, lunch, breakfast and snacks can't<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world is indeed awkward. In its broken memory, the crab feet that I have eaten are the longest, but the arm is long. The foot can be poked from the end of the cave to the other end. It can only remove one of them. The flame burns out the fluff outside, and the juice is contained in a smooth carapace without leaking a trace. After the red steam of the squid dissipates, it is the reddish outer layer, the white and tender legs inside, the elasticity, the delicious taste, and the juice inside is even better. Although it is poisonous, it must admit that their body may be to enjoy the food. And born - never really feel hungry, nor will it reduce the appetite and taste buds because of satiety, and most importantly, eat it will not gain weight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
