The flowers made many people marvel at them - vermilion, reddish, deep purple, pink and yellow, and even red and white, the flowers are huge, and the flower is surrounded by a velvety black. A young boy who wants to please his lover or a girl who is happy with it will pick up a few when he is not paying attention. However, if this behavior is discovered, he will not be able to take a hit. The management of the seedlings distributed to the tenant farmers is very clear, they will come in the coming year. Wheat fruit of this plant is to use to exchange them. To be honest, not many farmers are willing to plant this unfamiliar “tobacco”, but they cannot violate the will of the lord unless they want to be expelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time they need to pay attention to is not long. The flowering period of these flowers is not long. After seven days or eight days, they are dying. In ten days, the roots of the flowers swelled and turned into green ones, with tiny fluffy balls, and died in Ruiyi. Her brother Rika became the leader of Baita’s “fine net” guild. The first harvested fruit was also transported into the White Tower. Rica can be said to examine every fruit in great detail. He cut one of them with a small dagger, the white juice flowed out of the wound, and the apprentice who followed him immediately sent a Small plate. Rika squeezes the fruit and lets as much juice as possible into the plate. "Get a copy for me." He said to the apprentice around him. Gently rubbing your fingers. Satisfied with the familiar and rich bitterness, and the amount of juice - this plant was originally only suitable for planting on some of the gravelized land of the Dragon Fire Island, in order to adapt it to most types of soil, Rika and him The mentor had a lot of effort, but the results were satisfactory. Compared to those idiots who have studied how to make the devil's fingers grow a lot, their achievements are more worthy of the "mother" smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will face human beings. Indeed, compared to elves, compared to dwarves, even orcs and gnomes, human beings are not a kind of creature worth mentioning, but it must be admitted that they have no quality, but there are quantities. Before the millennium catastrophe, the gods did not pay much attention to humanity, but after that, almost all the gods had to rely on faith to gain strength, or to obtain permission to exist, far more than the other races. The human beings naturally become their new darlings - more than a thousand years have passed, for the dragon, it is just a process from a hard egg to a dragon, but for humans. It was an ancient history that lasted for hundreds of generations. In this millennium, their number has reached a new peak, as opposed to it. The battle for faith between the gods has entered a platform—at least not so sharp and clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not fair to new gods, who are willing to hand over their swords when human and other ethnic beliefs have been divided To an enemy? Ricardo's mentor occupies a very good position in Grenada. The favor of “mother” allows him to gain the privilege that many people can't get for life. If there are many people living in the main material plane, there is a layer of life. The heavy cockroaches, then the mentor of Rica is just a layer of tulle. As his most beloved disciple, Rica naturally had the privilege of peering into one or two of them - like Gredi... He paused a little and let his thoughts return to a safer place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do we price - these things?" A thief, also a so-called "businessman," humbly asked, he had to convince these red The robe warlock, not only because of the power and magic brought by the dragon's blood, but also their thoughts, Longhuo Island used this kind of thing to control slaves for hundreds of years, and cooperated with it. Almost all of the pharmacy flowed out of Grenada, but no one thought that the drug could be used in ordinary people either. It can be cut into pieces and placed in a hookah. It can also be directly burned and sniffed. It is also possible in food, and as a result of their experiments, no one can get rid of their temptations if they taste these sweet things, even if they can find the priest and ask the priest to drive away the toxins in their bodies. In fact, they are really willing to let those people do this... Because the toxins can be driven away, the wonderful feelings left by their “tobacco” cannot be forgotten, even if they can return home well, but Once tired, sad, angry, they will involuntarily search for it. Nothing can take away the sorrows and worries that linger in the whole life. Food can't, wine can't, women don't. Only it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think of a pound of gold?" Rika casually rubbed his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businessman did not show any objection, even the reluctant expression was just fleeting, but Rika knew what he was thinking, a gold coin The price of pounds is almost lower than that of tobacco. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What we need now is not gold coins. To be exact, not all." Rika rarely saw the idiot in front of his pet. But patiently explained: "We need it to be able to spread a wider range. When the hills are used to grow them and your goods are still in short supply, we can raise the price, even if it is One gold coin will be bought by someone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if so," the businessman cautiously asked: "If it is only a serf and a minimum mercenary, Then, by that time, they still can't afford enough money to buy our goods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," Rica said seriously: "Just Let them pray to the gods, and the gods are always kind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businessman swayed his head slightly, and then the answer was treated as a red robe. Humor, but he didn't know that Rica was extremely rare to say the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, they can pray to Gredi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" asked Master Alva. Now he is standing next to the Master and Pastor. They were all invited by Master Alva, including Perrante of Gray Ridge, who is a druid and therefore has a closer relationship with nature than ordinary people or elves. For most of the plants on the mainland, he can say that he is well-informed even if he can't be said to be well-known, and he is as good at using therapies and making potions as other casters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are not many places where this plant...has been amended. If you must say that the biggest change is probably its root system," Perant said: “It's roots are only suitable for growing in gravelized soil, but now they are able to grow well even in swamps with heavy water vapor.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have already harvested it once." A priest of Ilmot said that he lived not far from the hills, and the newly reclaimed land was only a few hundred feet away from his hidden woods, and everyone looked at him. At that time, he frowned. "A yog is bigger than a 150-pound fruit. As far as it is made into tobacco, I am not very clear."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This output is really not to be underestimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those people?" asked Master Alva. His disciples knew that he was asking himself, and his guide bowed. "We have eliminated the toxins in their bodies, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" They probably won't give up this tobacco," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bottomless abyss is down." The former priest Yilmout shouted: "What are they thinking about? They know that it is not a good thing. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva Master did not answer his question, "After being removed from toxins?" he asked, "They should no longer be subject to that kind of thing." The temptation is right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They...this is what they said." A Rosada priest said that he was praying to heal these people. One of the pastors: "But they... don't seem to think they have any great harm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pleasure that this kind of tobacco brings to humans is too Strong," said Master Alva, who is one of the victims. No one knows better than him how much happiness he can bring to the people who take it or take it. Occasionally, the old Master of Bibi Dykes can’t help himself. I want to relive the feelings of the time - he even quit the hookah for this. Otherwise, he didn't know if he would find the kind of tobacco in an unsupervised situation and stuff it into his own shisha. He looked at the many casters who surrounded him: "Trust me, even Its toxins can kill a person in one (one hour), and someone will go to the door of the sanctuary. After sucking it, knock on the gate of the sanctuary."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some people think that they can resist the temptation with magic or the power of the gods," Rosada’s pastor said with anxiety: "As far as I know, some of my colleagues are also learning. This kind of tobacco, they say it can bring them closer to the gods, and as long as they are willing, removing the toxins is nothing more than a prayer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It's useless to simply remove toxins." Alpha Mutter murmured: "It works not only on your body, but also on your thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But if you erase that memory, it's still possible." Another Il Special pastor said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem is that not every caster can, or is willing to freely release a spell or magic that erases memory," said the consul of the Betty Dyke. "My soldiers have seized one carrying this. A tobacco merchant, but I can't judge him to be guilty. There are too many people who are willing to buy his tobacco. Do you know how much they sell? One pound, only one gold coin, and they don't mind selling separately, one ounce. The small bottles are also sold, and the scattered pieces of a fingernail are also sold. Mercenaries and craftsmen particularly like their tobacco. They say that this tobacco pain is better than anything."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" asked Master Alva, now he is standing next to the Master. With the pastor, they are all invited by Master Alva, including Perrante of Gray Ridge. He is a druid, and therefore has a closer relationship with nature than ordinary people or elves. Most of the plants on the plate, even if he can’t say that he knows everything, I learned to speak through the heart, and he and other cast who like to make good use of therapy and medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are not many places where this plant is being revised. If you must say that the biggest change is probably its root system," Perant said: “It's roots are only suitable for growing in gravelized soil, but now they are able to grow well even in swamps with heavy water vapor.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have already harvested it once." A priest of Ilmot said that he lived not far from the hills, and the newly reclaimed land was only a few hundred feet away from his hidden woods, and everyone looked at him. At that time, he frowned. "A yog is bigger than a 150-pound fruit. As far as it is made into tobacco, I am not very clear."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This production is really not to be underestimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those people?" Master Alva asked, his disciple knew that he was asking himself, and his guide bowed. "We have already removed." The toxins in their bodies, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They probably won't give up this tobacco," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bottomless abyss is down." The former priest Yilmout shouted: "What are they thinking about? They know that it is not a good thing. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
