			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is the anti-theft section, updating the latest chapter of the Holy See before 12 o'clock tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo, who was forced into the depths of the room, grabbed his entourage and slammed it on a hard metal relief with eyes and lips clinging to it. In the narrow gap of the road, he first shouted his brother, and then his loyal friend - they voluntarily blocked in front of the holy room and fought for the companion who was closing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to his insults and screams with a strange accent, and the sound of weapons slashing on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entourage was silent and tried their best to suppress Medici’s parents, and more than one of them saw how Bernardo Bendini’s knife was Cut the skull of Giuliano de Medici, if the Virgin is pitiful, he can escape from that terrible injury, and the repeated spurs of Francisco de Pach have also cut off the last hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo’s eyes are blurred and exhausted. He feels anxious, thirsty, and the blood seems to turn into a hot flame to rush out of the nose. His reason has been Disappeared, the desire for revenge replaced all desires... When the suites thought about whether to stun him, his body collapsed after a powerful shackle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suites panicked and they pulled the neckline of Lorenzo’s tights so that he could breathe smoothly. Over and over, inspecting his trembling body in a touch--the light that permeates through the cracks of the door has no way to satisfy the human eye, but there are no windows or firestones and candles in the holy room. Although it was built soon, but with the continuous financial support of Medici, the new sacred room is still full of precious saints (sacred sacred), crowns, scepters, holy grail icons, portraits and transcripts, spices , painted manuscripts, tapestries, precious metals... cautious servants will not allow any hidden dangers here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a careful guy found a long and narrow cut on the left side of his neck, the wound was unusually swollen and hot, and the surrounding was wet. . At this time they discovered that Lorenzo was sweating a lot. One of the entourages, called Antonio, did not hesitate to squat down, and was close to Lorenzo, trying to suck out venom for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This doesn't help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound behind him made everyone shocked. Several young people suddenly turned around and kept Medici's parents behind them, clenching their daggers or daggers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person standing in the dark moves his footsteps, he opens the palm of his hand, a small glass bottle in his palm, and the faint and clear green light illuminates his strange shape. The knuckles and deep palm prints. “No need to be nervous, Medici young people.” The monk said in the Florentine dialect that the Medici are familiar with, he used another hand to pull down the headscarf. “This is just phosphor powder, a kind of powder that glows, reading too much. Old books can be protected from glare and fire damage; it doesn't have much harm..." The monk made a subtle pause, then continued to move forward two steps, completely ignoring those approaching the throat and chest. Sword - He bent his neck and observed Lorenzo de Medici in a painful breath with an indescribable look: "At least, it is better than Medici's blood - this venom will Residing in the wound and nearby clots, if you rush to squat, there is no other use besides sending a precious life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Modestly lowering the body, letting the terrible green light shine on the face of the dying person, and carefully searching for every detail: "Look, he is sweating, breathing fast, chilling, tongue strong," he is excited Said: "This The venom has entered his blood vessels, and it may take a while to get into the heart, where it can do its best – he will twitch, dyspnea, and slow heartbeat. If that is the case...” The monk looked up, Say the conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In that case...he will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo de Medici stands on the second floor of the wing of the Palazzo Vecchio, overlooking the venue for the abbot and the Chief Executive to read the notice There, Jack P. De Pach’s death sentence was being read, and he was captured and sent back to Florence while passing through Romagna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pacchi family’s rebellion ended faster than the beginning, and the Florentines did not support them—although Jack Pued de Pach once shouted "Freedom" and "people" pass through the entire city, but the only answer he can get is "ball" (some people say that this word means they support Medici, but more people think it is only literal, well known In the meantime, their other accomplice, the archbishop of Pisa, Sylvia, self-righteously led a group of mercenaries hired by Perugia, holding the handcuffs of Pope Sistus III in an attempt to control the Florentine government. "Justice chess player" Sesley Petru and other officials of the government seized, followed by ** naked Francisco de Pach (people found him, he was in his own room at the Pach Palace, treatment The thigh, which was accidentally wounded while assassinating Giuliano, was hanged outside the window of the ruling palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The archbishop was neatly dressed, and he was bitten by his anti-binding hands and bitten several pieces of meat on Francisco de Pach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to them, the other masterminds of the Pach family were also hung next to them, and Medici’s royal painter Pomolic used charcoal on one side. The strips and planks are sketched and recorded, and he will carefully depict their deaths, and then transfer them to the wall that has been painted with gray-gypsum plaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be said to be a late warning, or a tragic victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jack was struggling to hang on a sling, people cheered – this month they were excited to welcome another John the Baptist (Florence The main protector of the saints). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people flocked to the Medici Palace and expressed loyalty to Lorenzo, and then, like some qualifications, droves On the streets, search for the goals you see, hear, and think. All the people associated with the Pach family fell down, their assets were plundered, their homes were seized, their wives and children were violated, and they were castrated and then castrated and then hanged... for three weeks in a row. Half of Florence is in the midst of a hurricane--"Death is not surprising, the streets are full of men's genitals." Some people have documented this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these "justices" are purely blind, or just venting the depression on the losers, while others have clear goals, just With this opportunity, I have a grievance. Of course, more people are for the value of the Medici family, just like every festival, interesting shows and excellent works of art can be rewarded with great rewards, and those who give the enemy’s first level to Lorenzo can Get 5 to 100 "Florin" (the most popular gold coin in Florence). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two archbishop’s entourage was so dragged by the two trainee monks from the Benedictine monastery near Badia Palace. . Each person received 150 Florin. Of course, in order to show respect for the government and the law, they were handed over to the "just players" and the ruling officials by the Medici family. After a formal trial, they were hanged on the window of the ruling palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pach’s widow and daughter will be sent to the monastery and will not be married for the rest of their lives. Of course, there will be no children. The Pazzi family assets throughout Europe were traced and confiscated in the following years, and their family names and badges were destroyed on the spot wherever they were found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bianca of the Medici family was married to Guglielmo of the Pach family. She was still young, but she refused when Lorenzo asked if she would like to marry again. Her eyes sparkled with wisdom and wisdom. Worldly boredom - her husband killed her brother, and her other brother hanged her husband on the window, even if there is no evidence that Guglielmo participated in the conspiracy, but as long as his surname It is Pach, he is guilty, the only thing to be thankful is that they still have no children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernardo Bendini has not yet achieved his due ending, his portrait was painted upside down, slings clasped his feet... "Evil brings death to the wicked, and those who hate the righteous should compensate," Lorenzo whispered. Bendini’s whereabouts have been discovered by the Medici agents in Constantinople, who, while delivering the secrets, obtained permission from the Sudan at the expense of all the silk and spices that could be mobilized around him. The locals pursued the hunt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ugly monster hidden behind the Archbishop of Pisa and the Pach family, offering them rare poisons to satisfy their own lusts in the name of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope Sykestus IV was furious, especially learned that the Archbishop of Pisa had been hanged, and Cardinal Rafaelo di Riariodi was After Dicci was detained, the successor of the apostle Peter did not hesitate to confiscate the property of the Medici family and threatened Florence. If he did not give Lorenzo to him, he would expel all related to the Medici. The teachings of the personnel will also usurp the teachings of the whole of Florence - in fact, Naples has joined forces with the Pope to prepare for the invasion of Florence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midici’s parents seem to be able to see the people happily putting the same noose around their neck. Before Jack had not completely turned into a corpse, he walked away from the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He faltered - the Patki family's rebellion was like a thunderous plague, it took Juliano's life and took it away. Lorenzo's health, youth and gentle tolerance are a bit naive. Now his eyes are gloomy, gray and white, and the cheeks and loose skin can hang down to the wrinkled neck. These changes are completed in just a few days. Medici's parents don't seem to have to go through middle age. At the stage, the young and vigorous young people entered the deadly leap year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo goes through the dark corridor, down the stairs, through the atrium, the gallery, the hall, into the second courtyard behind the Palazzo Vecchio - There was an abandoned chapel, which was later converted into a sewing room for the women, but now it is used as a temporary delivery room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the largest room, there was nothing but a special shape production chair and a big bed for the rest of the woman. The doors and windows were wide open, but the stove, the hot tub and the Medici women who came to comfort and encourage the mother still let this The steam inside is steaming. According to custom, any factor around the maternal may interfere with the factors that hinder production. All the rings, laces, braids, buttons and shackles have to be taken away. All the women have untied the silk rope, ribbons, buttons and neckline open to reveal the bright, wet skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Production has been going on for a day and a night, and the mother who was hugged in the arms of a strong servant maid gave birth to a girl in a sitting position and no longer had the strength After giving birth to a second child, after a few hours, the fetus still in the mother's abdomen no longer visibly squirmed. The doctor made a judgment. The midwife took out the hook with a knife on the head. This is what any mother sees. When it comes to something that will be scared, it will go deep into the womb, and the unproductive child will be chopped and pulled out one by one. The mother who was tortured by her own child is the first to produce, but she obviously knows And understand what is going to happen. Just as the women turned their heads and tried to escape this bloody scene, the girl’s mother suddenly broke free of the maid’s arms. She stood up and held her raised belly. - After a brief silence and a shout of screaming, the blood replaced the depleted amniotic water and wrapped the baby down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby fell to the ground, not crying, but he was still alive. His exhausted mother fell to his side, and after confirming this gratifying news, he suddenly passed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo arrived, everything was over, his wife, Orsini’s Clarity cut out and greeted him, bringing him to the special Prepared for the baby in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twin children. Girls are born first, boys are born, very healthy." Clarice whispered, she has always been cautious, silent and courteous, But today Lorenzo can feel the joy and enthusiasm from her voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midici’s parents looked at her intricately. They also had a pair of twins six years ago, but they died before baptism because They did not elute the original sin, they were not able to bury themselves in the Medici family. The two small bones that hug together can only be secretly buried in the corner of the courtyard. From the time of Caesar, people here have this custom - they buried their dying children under their own eaves, thinking that this can make the child's soul peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliano’s twins were transferred into a room that was already prepared next door, dark and quiet, so that they would not come to a stranger suddenly The world is frightened. Through the glimmer of the gap between the gaps, Lorenzo’s eldest daughter and the servant are bathing the two children with a mixture of hot milk and red wine, and the fifth-year-old woman is applying hot water and honey to the child’s throat so that They can speak and swallow smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
