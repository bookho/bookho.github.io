			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan is a thief, or the leader of a thief guild branch, of course he can not be innocent, he killed the old man, killed the child, killed the man, also Killing women; killing innocent people (most of them), and killing sinful people (wonderfully, the number of such people is not as small as people think); he received the order of the guild to kill, and The murder is murdered, or it is only for his own lusts. He kills the enemy and kills the benefactor. The white bone accumulated in his hand is enough to fill his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was the first to face the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s different from the small, sneaky battle of the guild (although at that time, more than fifty people’s actions were a thrilling for Gülen. The mammoth battles); and what he had experienced before, the thunderbolt walls are completely different in exploratory battles; the soldiers, the people and the knights of Thunderbolt are facing a real war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it’s not as grand and magnificent as the singers who travel around the world, on the contrary, it’s ugly, dirty, Desperate and bored - no beautiful flags, no bright armor, no tears, no beauty, no roses, no exhilarating speeches, no impassioned music, even a worthy description There are no eyes, only death and the upcoming death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans have already returned to the first city wall, but this is only temporary, look at the orcs who are attached to the wall! They are as dense and ubiquitous as the locusts that cover the calves. The dead orcs and human beings were dragged to the wall and piled up. The blood they shed quickly condensed in the cold weather, making the ladder constructed by the body hard and firm; some orcs will die of the same kind. The claws are cut down and used as a hammer. The dirty claws are as sharp as a small dagger. Even if they are only scratched a bit, if there is no timely treatment by the priest, the poison hidden in the human body will also take away a poison. The life of a strong knight - in addition to the claws, the death of the orcs and human heads and the internal organs instead of stone balls are thrown into the city wall, the former will bring disease and the latter will bring fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is almost no such thing as a strategy in this war, and there is no longer a need. The ratio of human to orc is one to three - a human soldier needs At the same time facing two or more orcs, their strength is almost exhausted, and the enemy is endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gülen found Baldwin on the second wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body left by the orcs when they first attacked the outer fort of the two walls has not been cleared, and the flames in some places are still alive. The smoky smog, the smell they emit is not as significant as it was at first—because the walls, the blood, the body and the body are everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why would they let you come?" The Knights around Bywin asked: "What about our soldiers and mages?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are three red robes and a gray robes there," Gülen said, unnaturally moving his body, and the white light that had not dissipated made him feel uncomfortable: "There is still one Hundreds of thieves who are good at hiding and assassinating." He opened the cloak so that they could see his wound clearly, the wound was treated with grass, but still can see how dangerous it is - up a bit It’s his arteries, and the next point is his heart: “And I happen to be a thief.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin sighed exhaustedly and full of doubts "I thought you should escape far away, instead of returning to this dangerous prison."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gülen only shrugged slightly If he can, he is of course willing to stay away from it as soon as possible - he has pulled out a gold necklace from his pocket, gold Hanging a coat of arms embellished with enamel and gems, this is the coat of arms of the family of the prince's confidant, Birdwin can recognize it at a glance, if only the coat of arms, perhaps Bydwin can be said to have been stolen or It was taken from the body, but Gülen immediately took out a living evidence, Kerry’s Ji Yun, who blew a small silver flute, which looked like a furry ball. The little bird flew in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have heard of some spells that can confuse animals," said a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you get through the fair and great Tyre? - What do you think?" Gülen sarcastically said: "But don't hurry, Thunderbolt Human beings are all going to die there, oh, that are the ones you want to protect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the knights who cast him indicate that he is not trusted by them. Even if the detection spells cast by Birdwin indicate that the thief is not lying, this spell cannot guarantee that he has said all the truth, or that every word in the word can match the true meaning, but no one can afford it. I was able to take this responsibility - in the end they still attributed their sights to their owners - the lord of Thundersburg was sitting on a simple wooden chair, his forehead was hurt, and the wound was condensed with black blood. His hair and beard were messy, and his face was unhealthy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Masters?" asked Birdwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knight took a step forward, "At rest," he said solemnly: "But adults..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please ask Alfred and his two masters to come here immediately." Birdwin said: "Maybe he is lying - but we..." He shook again. Shake his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizards arrived very quickly, they looked so good, the black robes were neat and clean, called Alfred’s Master of the Year Ten, but the corners of the eyes and the corners of the mouth have been covered with harsh wrinkles, and there is a gray-white goatee on the chin. He looked at Gülen with a cautious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What spell have you cast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, the problem is here, Gülen replied not so happily: "I don't know - can you see what spells I have been cast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Alf Master Reid just turned around and went to Birdwin for a mage ceremony. "We will come back soon, Sir Alex."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If true... Lan said, "Bedwin said: "You don't have to think about it here, I don't want you to be bound by anything - when you will face a tough enemy," he stood up from his chair and held it vigorously. Master's shoulder: "I will give them to you - and," he nodded to the side of his body: "Ten knights and fifty soldiers, sorry, I can't give you more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...He walks with us." Master Alfred asked, a resentful thief, a poisonous nail Staying in this precarious place doesn't know what harm it will cause. The human mage who has served in Thunderbolt for more than a decade will not allow any hidden dangers around Bywin – they can be dispatched without extra staff. To this despicable guy, not to mention that two knights have grown out of big bags because of him, just on the back of the head, and now there is a dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan has no objection to this, he doesn't think it will be much safer than that cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Budwin, Sir," before leaving, Gülen suddenly asked: "What if I am still in your jail?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
