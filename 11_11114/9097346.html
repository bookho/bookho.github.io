He carefully looked for Giuliano's shadow on the baby's face, and he regretted that, apart from the tall nose and the slender and tightly closed eyes, he had not yet found a family belonging to the Medici. That part; perhaps because the mother is a relationship between the hair and the skin that is white to the weird Sisla, the color of the skin at the retreat of the blood is lighter than expected, and the contour of the face is very soft, but the color of the hair is very Deep - the child's mother should have a pair of light gray eyes, Lorenzo searched in his memories for a few impressions left in a short glimpse, he hopes the child can inherit Juliano's brown eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the newborns who were repeatedly harassed by the light finally opened their eyes impatiently, though only for a moment - except for Lorenzo, all the people present were sent out Breathing in general, being exclaimed by the death and death - the child's eyes show a moving pale gold under the sunlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, another child, the boy, opened his eyes, and some were still suspecting that they had hallucinations or parallax in the dark. The person has to admit the facts in front of him... The color of the other child's iris is more pure and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo is a little surprised, but that's it. The Medici parents who have tens of thousands of books have read that a local person if and Another combination of opposite sex, which is far away, makes it possible to give birth to a child with amber eyes. It is rare, but it is not a disease, nor is the devil doing it. And the color of the child's eyes will change with age, and maybe one day, it will become plain black or brown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But women, especially those who have no knowledge and knowledge, are panic-stricken, constantly crossing the chest and expelling the devil's gestures. If it wasn't for Lorenzo's entourage who had mastered the door in time, they would probably run out and mess around - it would be awful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can be alarmed?" Lorenzo calmly turned from the cradle and put his arms across his chest: "Is this an evil color?" he asked in a loud voice: "On the road Before Ziffre had not fallen from the sky, the Father used gold as his armor; the angel pointed to the holy city of Jerusalem, which the Apostle apostles saw, the ninth cornerstone of which was the topaz; obeying the Father’s intention, When Moses built the tabernacle at Mount Sinai, wasn't the cabinet that he made for the Lord, was it inlaid with fine gold, wasn't the cherubim on either side of the mercy seat beaten with gold, and the bottle on the table, Isn't the lampstand and the wine prince all gold, hanging on the chest of the high priest, and the breastplate inscribed in the name of the Lord, isn't it also the fine gold? When Jesus Christ was born, he came to worship him three times. The doctor of the East, isn’t it a gift of gold, myrrh and agarwood? Is it not a yellow jade like a tiger’s eye when Herod wants to exchange the life of St. John from Salome? Used to sacrifice the Wickendes of St. Sarahsha Hey, St. Ricardo's rabbit ear leeks, St. Anthony's buttercups, do not have the most distinctive golden yellow? And, as a symbol of worship, purity, sincerity and piety, used to carve the icon, grinding The rosary beads, inlaid on the bishop's ring, are not the sun-like precious amber. What is it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Paul’s disciples said: 'Your eyes are The light of the body. When your eyes are pure, your body is bright; but if it is evil, your body is dark.' This is a blessed eye! It can not only put the color of the outside into the heart, but also the color of the soul. Respond to the surface... stupid people, you **** praying at night, hoping that the grace of the Father can come to your own body, but when it comes to the end, you are like a sly and awkward person without consciousness. - Like the ignorant who had the privilege of seeing Christ walking on the sea, the innocent eyes made them see the savers as ghosts that made their situation worse, panic, shout, and even resist the hands that saved them. - Are you still making this sad mistake now?" He screamed aggressively, and his expression was grim and firm, like a judge who held the will of the Holy Spirit in heaven and the authority of the apostles on earth, but even The latter may not be able to make such a provision that is at least temporarily blameless and unshakable in such a short period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before the end of this little speech, his wife Clarice has already reached the other side of the cradle, instead of the derelict maid appeasement disturbed Baby, she gently took turns to pick them up, kissed with affection and frequent, shouting the name of the child's chief protector, Nige, and asked him to pray for the peace and health of the child - she did not die from the baby's gaze. Nor did he burn his fingers or get a leprosy because he touched something "evil". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clarice and her husband's words and deeds succeeded in dispelling an accident that could lead to great disasters. The servants calmed down and looked at each other. It seemed hard to believe that the mad and frantic creature was himself—and finally they were even ashamed... ...this shame erases the last bit of stupidity caused by stupidity and ignorance; the windows and doors that were forcibly pushed open and resisted are quietly re-opened, and they carefully return to their original positions and continue before Work, although occasionally will make your own vision will consciously or unconsciously avoid the two cradle close together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is once again immersed in darkness and tranquility, only a ray of light shines into the room from the crevice of the velvet curtain, just like the Holy Spirit put his eyes on it. Two new lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April 26, 1478, Giuliano de Medici He was killed by 19 knives in the Rebellion of the Pach family, and his child was born on May 26, 1478. After being baptized three days later, the girl inherited the name of the wife of Ksimimo I and was named Constella. The boy was named Julio, Giulio di Giuliano de Medici. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first volume of children<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 1 Assisi's monastery<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History is full of lies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julio di Giuliano de Medici in the history book, like Constella, is Lorenzo de Medici Adoption, spend your carefree childhood and teenage years in the comfortable and safe Wichio Palace until. But in fact, when he was still awkward, he was handed over by his uncle to Bishop Francis Todescheni Pikromini, who was preached by Pope Siscott IV in central Italy. I spent the first six years of my precious life in a continuous trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, they came to Assisi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assisi, a small town situated between the hills, it even existed more than the city of Rome, as early as 238 years after the Lord, there was Saint Lufi He preached and taught, but eventually made it the holy city of Umbria and even the Balkans. It was founded in 1182 and in San Francisco in 1194. The former was founded. The Franciscan sects, who were poor in poverty, chastity, and obedience, were sacred in the two years after the death (1228), the latter being his loyal followers, founded the St. Galle Women's Retreat, 1253 He died in the same year, and he also sealed the holy two years later (1255). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the pilgrimage to the Assisi who came to worship this life-long poverty, chastity, and true sages, in the same year, under the initiative of the monk Aria, the people of Assisi and the church funded the construction of St. Francis Churches and affiliated monasteries to accommodate more monks and pilgrims. The church was built close to what was originally called "Hell's Hill" and was built by the hills of Sanctuary, which was renamed "The Mountain of Heaven". It was divided into two halls, completed in 1253, extremely delicate and huge. And beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julio’s current guardian, a student of Bishop Bicroimini recently became the bishop of Perugia by relying on his uncle’s gold coin, he knows Bishop Piccolomini was preached by the predecessor of the Pope in the Umbria region, so he tried to invite his brother to come to Hajj and Franciscans. Of course, Piccolomini arrived in Weng. The Brass area was the first time to go through this sacrament, but the Hajj sage is just like doing homework, it will never be more or less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Bishop Bicroioni entered Assisi, the morning lesson around 2am had just ended, and the bishop of Perugia who got the news was in St. Francis In front of the monasteries, I happily placed my hands in front of the protruding lower abdomen. He specially selected a velvet robe called Dalmatika for today's reunion. The fuchsia velvet used in the robe is from Milan. Come, there will be a little golden light under the candle or the torch. The golden cross and a square badge are hanging on the chest. The Franciscans and the birds are engraved on the badge, and the deep purple crystals are inlaid. Behind him is the dean of the Franciscan Monastery, the priests and deacons, and the monks of St. Francis, wearing brown robes with hoods and white linen ropes around the waist, such as St. Francis So bare feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most trusted priests of the Perugia bishop holds him a golden sacred box containing a decaying rope, which is said to have been counted Ten years of entanglement in the waist of the saint, witnessed his faith and purity. Bishop Perugia is not very satisfied with this. He hopes to come up with something more worthy of people’s surprise, but St. Francis is not an ordinary saint. He carried out the retreat before and after the glorious cross. Forty days of fasting and retreat, for this reason angels came down from the clouds, giving him five hands and feet, five sacrificial marks under the ribs - and so far, the only holy mark recognized by the Holy See, and before his lifetime After death, there are still hundreds of miracles. His conduct and piety are unacceptable and skeptical. It is precisely because of this that no one dares to treat the other saints, from the Franciscans. The lower part of the body is cut and placed separately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Franciscans did indeed work as eloquently as he preached, and he did not even hold a wooden pole in his hands, so that he was fully equipped. After being detained by our dear Lord, the things he left were filled with dissatisfaction with a room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Bishop Perugia had to accept the proposal of the abbot of the abbey. They brought three sacred objects belonging to St. Galle from the Church of St. Galle, and two deacons gave him a copper incense burner with three chains. The copper incense burner is burning charcoal, and the charcoal is dumped on it. The thick smoke like a thick mist carries a scent of lingering around the crowd. Two other deacons hold the holy book for him. The holy book is beautifully decorated. Expensive, the incisions are plated with gold, and there are no less than twelve kinds of precious gemstone pigments, which were completed and copied by the same monk for nearly ten years; in addition, there are four beautiful waiters. Tong, holding a silver plate, with silver wine from the French Loire region, white bread with flour and milk sifted 20 times, and a huge curved neck pot, which is warm inside. Water is not used for drinking, but is used to wash away the dust between the face and the fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the people they waited for finally appeared on the gray trail on a horse, the happiest thing was not the bishop of Perugia, but the one A waiter who only bends the neck pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyromini has jumped from the moment, for a man who is forty-five years old, he still looks very strong and agile, he shaves The hair was neatly arranged above the thick eyebrows, the eyelids were slightly swollen, and the eyes were as sharp as the eagle. His nose bent down and his mouth sagged down, making him daunting - he wore a piece and a holy The close-knit robes of the monks of Chiang, wrapped in a wide and long wool cloak, are pale yellow, without any bleaching, and without embroidery and buttons, only use a copper pin on the left shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deacon was waved and refused when he wanted to help him. Bishop Perugia made a dirty gesture in his heart, even with a Grimace, in view of his old classmates still not that incompetent, but did not have time to salute, did not have time to talk, Piccolooni gave him a big shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that Picromini’s feet are on the ground is to bring up the cloak and let the little guy hiding inside fall off. come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a child, about five years old, at most six years old, with a black curly hair, cheeks are as rosy as roses, his eyes are one Very very light brown, a thin amber is the color in the sun, the light of the torch and candle flashes in those eyes, like a star, like a dragonfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The son of a friend," said the bishop of Piccolo and Perugia, walking hand in hand on the promenade of the monastery: "Because For some reason, he can't stay with his loved ones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
