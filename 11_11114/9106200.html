			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theft chapter, the latest chapter will be updated around noon tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter VII, Gooseberry and Belladonna (I)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you let Bishop Perugia In this case, he hopes that Bishop Bicroimini and his "followers" will leave Assisi as soon as possible. Everyone knows that anything will happen before the chimney of the Sistine Chapel (Note 1) - but in any case, even the Borgia in Rome may not be a despicable pilgrimage. Excuses or shirks, public opinion is far superior to the Bishop of Piccolo, who is a red-shirter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many ways to worship the Franciscans. Yes, people agree that the long and hard way of pilgrimage is the most devout and most orthodox way of following the path of the saints and walking through every path through which he barefooted, not to mention the cost of the road. Time and energy, plus the threat of hunger, disease and thieves, you have to be young (at least not older than the Franciscans before the vocation), strong (can withstand all kinds of A torment, and a strong and intelligent person (you don't want to know how many poor pilgrims are lost on the road to life). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, more people choose to simplify the program. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First you have to worship the Eucharist - and then, from the house where St. Francis was born, to his baptized church; to him as a homeless The Assisi mountain range that wandered through the refugees; to the leprosy hospital near Assisi (St. Francis is there to take care of some of the most terrible patients); to the San Damien that was repaired by the hands of St. Francis after the collapse Church, Church of St. Mary (now St. Francis of the Holy Francis) and some other small churches; to the squares, villages and woods where he preached; to the sacred five-injured Avignon mountain hut in San Francesco To the church of Assisi, look at the statues of Chimabu, Jakopo, Ducho, Giotto and his disciples for the Franciscans; to the Badingula Chapel of the Subo Snow Mountain Monastery (Sanctuary) Jiuji lived as a user;) to the manger in the monastery hall of the Grydy Rudi Valley; to the Hell Hill where he was once buried (which was originally used only to bury criminals and refugees, St. Francis insisted on being buried there, and now is also a holy place); to St. George The Great Altar in the lobby, where the saints were finally sanctified by the will of the Lord after the call of my Lord (yes, the day after the death of St. Francis, people dug him out, the first of the holy In two years, he was transferred to the bottom of the Great Altar....<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key point is that this simplified pilgrimage process seems to be a bit too slow for Bishop Perugia. Of course, he is not without reason to suddenly decide to send Caesar Borgia, the Holy Spirit is on, he sees To the assassin of Lovere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is how a ghost is." Bishop Perugia said that he can say that he prayed sincerely and returned to his own The bed is asleep, the bishop's bed and the monastery provide the same bed for the rich pilgrims, not only the curtains, linen sheets, wool blankets, goose down pillows, but also the scented lavender box, which is said to remove fleas and bed bugs. The specific effects are not known, but the bishop's bedding is a new one. Except for the original ones, no strangers jumped on him to hold a banquet for food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s reasonable to say that this environment is very good, but after letting go of the curtain, the Peruvian bishop can’t sleep, and he can see it when he closes his eyes. To the long-wearing gray-gray underwear, sleeveless outerwear, and an assassin with a leather belt, maybe the latter thinks that he is no different from many pilgrims... oh, don’t say that the pair should not appear in the pilgrims at all. The body, the eagle and the wolf-like eyes, it is not used for decoration and intimidation but a practical and fine thorn sword and dagger, as well as a string wrapped around the arm - also thought that no one knows that it is not used Is it a birdie to break the neck? Looking at the ball hanging at the end, when Bishop Perugia was a laity, he saw how it took a life--a hand grabbed a ball and the rope crossed the victim’s head. Set, and then forcefully, you will be able to smell the smell of urinating in a short time. It is said that assassins who are as powerful as Samson can even twist the target's head directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention that Bishop Perugia saw this person at the banquet of Bishop Lovere, he is a bodyguard and swordsman, but like many families, This kind of person is more of a role as an assassin. Bishop Perugia is not a smart person, at least not as good as Picromini, his classmates and friends, but that person has a dog face, which makes He is very impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned up in an annoyed body and pinched the meat on his stomach. For many days, the poor Bishop Perugia was having a nightmare, not himself. In a gloomy corridor, the sudden thorns are pierced from front to back (although he believes that the relationship with Lovere is not so bad), that is, when he cheerfully opens the lid of the dish I saw not a fat rabbit, but the head of a small Borgia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Still let Piccoloni reduce a few pilgrimage points." He said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pilgrimage team set off after the morning prayer, and the little monk brought by Piccolomini was left in the monastery. He was too small, fundamentally I can't keep up with the pace of the adults, let alone they have to go through the rugged mountains, and there is a leprosy hospital on the way to the pilgrimage - although Piccolo is a priest, he is also a teacher at the university. Half-taunting is called a wizard, because he has excellent medical skills and extraordinary medical concepts - he believes that young children and the elderly are indeed more susceptible to infection than strong young people. So after careful consideration, he left Julio Medici and a monk who was responsible for looking after him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" The monk asked with enthusiasm: "Julio brothers?" Not just because of Julio. Dici is still a child, and because this monk was originally a friend of Lorenzo Medici, he is a goldsmith, not ready to become a monk, but since Medici gave him generous compensation, he can follow Bishop Piccoloni traveled the entire Umbria region together, he could learn more, or he might work for a bishop in the near future, or maybe go to Rome in the future, so let him take care of him. The child of Giuliano de Medici will not have any problems, let alone he has created a beautiful gold lily heraldry pendant for the beautiful man of Florence, and got a lot of money. The rewards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to go to the courtyard to see." Julio said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goldsmith monk looked out, what Julio said was not the courtyard inside the monastery, but outside the monastery, a green and lush place, there is a forest There are streams outside the forest, and on both sides of the stream are the orchards and herb gardens opened up by the monks. Now several monks are busy in the fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," said the goldsmith monk, "I will go with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Julio Medici is a real young child, his thoughts may not be respected, and even more so to avoid accidents, the monks who care for him will not allow him to walk out of the monastery, but since Julio’s body There is an adult soul - he certainly won't allow this to happen to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Bicroimini has more than 20 followers, but they are indeed ordinary or uncommon monks - I mean, including Bishop Bicromini, is a group of happy bachelors, did not even think Have a wife and children. Of course, they did not care for the child's experience at all, and Julio was just able to eat something other than milk and was sent by his uncle to the crisis of Florence, his cot became Bishop Bicrometi With the cloaks of other monks, his silver bowl became a wooden cup and palm, and his maid became a group of clumsy men. The only advantage was that they could not detect the children they carried with them. Normal children are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rarely cries, more correctly, he has few counts of crying; he knows to use laziness and yelling to tell others that he has to deal with personal matters; He is determined not to eat anything that is harmful to him - too hot, cold, too rough or greasy; he insists on taking a bath every two days, every night and morning, and after eating Face and hands. Don't ask the monks how to know, the ability to communicate is more calm than the crying and yelling, and there is no stupid thing to follow Bishop Bicroimini - other than that, he did not give this Groups of men bring more trouble, especially after he can use his hands and feet freely, he rarely needs the help and service of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Giulio Medici began to speak, his talents got more opportunities to show up, especially in terms of language and discourse, he is best at It is a proverb (Florence lingua, Italian), Latin, Greek and French, and occasionally a few Hebrew words and Arabic syllables. Before he came to Assisi, he could recite the entire Bible. And some small questions and monks inside, as well as some little joyful and interesting debates by Bishop Piccolo, his thoughts are full of purity and wonder belonging to young children, everyone is willing to talk to him, listen Listen to his thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives Julio a position in the team that cannot be compared to a bishop or a monk, but at least his willingness is not due to his childhood It has been ignored and ignored again and again. If his requirements are not excessive, they can usually be satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goldsmith monk took Julio through the entire monastery, and the monks of the Franciscan Monastery saw Julio walking slowly in the big When the monk was behind him, he smiled. He was a devout person who donated his children and his property to the church. But such a small child is still rare. "Where do you want to take him? Brother." Asked the monk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
