It brings a sharp pain like a whip, but this is not what she cares. She only cares about Birdwin. What comforts the princess is that Baldwin is just standing there, biting his teeth and looking serious. But he stared at Leona, and when she was looking for an answer, she did not infiltrate into her own eyes the suspicion and disgust that would make her fear of despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin couldn’t figure out what it was all about, Leona knew that Bedwin had never had a courtier and elder outside of her. Emotions - he knows Leona better than Leona's father, who is willing to believe her. Out of everyone’s surprise, the king did not immediately become thunderous. He went to the fireplace and threw the entire lock box into the flame. People immediately smelled it. The stench of hair burnt, "Leona," he said quietly in his tone: "Leave here and stay with your aunt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave," said the king. "Don't let me call the guard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Leona walked out of the room, the king extended his hand to the Duke of John: "Give me your sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of John gently held the blade In the second half, the secret silver sword that was too heavy for him was handed over to His Majesty the King. His Majesty took the hilt and tried to wave two times in the air. He was in the thunderstorm. It is one-fifth now, but the power is three times that of the present, but at that time he was faced with a bloodthirsty and large orc, so his martial arts can still be said to be quite ordinary among ordinary people. Excellent - waving his third straight secret silver sword when it penetrates the open Balboa Jazz chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Kel’s eyes wide open, he looked at Fukai, this awkward humanoid dragon promised him a dazzling wealth, amazing Power, and to ensure that he can be safe after tearing open the awkward fig leaf, but he only saw Fukai licking the pair and Dylan Donkley, the green eyes are like jade eyes. He sent him a pitiful smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of John moved his shoulders slightly. The young count fell from the tip of the sword and fell to the ground. His blood blew the black wolf skin, and the Duke and Fukai exchanged a quick look. Fu Kai shook his head invisibly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If King’s Majesty really intends to completely conceal this matter, Fu Kaiman does not care. Then he has to use one or two small pieces that he didn't really want to use. In the past few months, the "that" bard and his companions he had sent to Thunderbolt have been similar to the rest of the world. In the various large and small pubs and squares in the outer city of Wangdu, there are thousands of old ones. In the poems of the gods and knights, the wise and the king, there have been quietly mixed up a few new songs - all describing how a humble knight knows a princess. Get along, love and eventually marry her and become a king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This song is the favorite of the poor slaves. They like this and imagine that they will be sent to the throne by a beautiful and affectionate princess one day. But follow Fu Kai's instructions. The bards only occasionally sang a few short but interesting stories - but if King’s Majesty really decided to continue to shelter Baldwin, Fukai wouldn’t mind letting his good kids take it as soon as possible. Spread out. He knows that some nobles are not afraid to come up with their own property and support the king with the Cavaliers. That is because they are eager to become the grandfather of the new king, but they are not crazy, they want to bow to the knees of a rude and unmarried child. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Fukai soon knew that he didn’t have to do that—the king suddenly grabbed the heavy brass bottle from the statue and slammed it. On Baldwin's shoulder, the wine inside filled his entire upper body - if it wasn't for the Tyre Knight instinctively avoiding it, then it was his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty!" Birdwin yelled in a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I trust you...Bedwin..." The king whispered, "The gods are on, I trust you so much..." he said "I will give you bread, give you wine, give you weapons, give you armor, give you horses, give you gold coins..." The more he said the more urgent, the voice gradually became higher: "I give you, one only A surname in the mud and feces, a surname, a surname embroidered on the embroidered tapestry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words are more than that brass bottle To make Baldwin feel pain, he did his best not to taste the contempt between the king's words: "Please, please! Please listen to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will give you a land!" the king shouted. "Catch it from the noble people. I will give it to you and make you the master of Thunder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I and Princess Leona..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Enough! Bydwin, you are hiding under the stone, you can't see it, Hey pustules! Don't use your tongue that chews the locusts to say the distinguished name! Endless hell is down! How can I choose you! A bad ethic, a morally low thief, an unidentified squat Yes, you, you! A slave, a criminal and a jealous hybrid!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“陛下!”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak, you don't have that qualification, there is only muddy mud in your blood vessels! Morton Donkley has nothing to do with you - he gave you the Thunder Fortress, but it is In order to laugh at my sister Diane - why should he choose a good person, he has seen you from so many people, Bo Devin, Byrdwin, look at it, look at yourself, what can you love in your body? Everything you give is what I give, I pull you from the blood sludge and wipe it clean. Your face, give you silk to wear, give you a ring to wear, and you reward me like this? Lure my daughter? You are enough to be her father!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are not satisfied with what I am giving you, do you want more? You - also want to be a king?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, deserve your parents are dead, and your embarrassment, or I will hang them! Hang them on the wall and let the crows lick Their eyes, the mouse licked their tongues!" The king yelled: "I will dig their bones and find their souls. I will torture them for a hundred years or more! Just because they made you this. Greedy snake!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to take back my gift to you Everything! Your last name! Your manor! Your army! Your honor! "Cried the king vague, tonight swallow the wine has played a role thoroughly, his staggering pace, confusion. Only anger is constantly rising. How much has he paid for this throne! Even his father, his mother, his wife! Now there is a low-lying soldier who wants to take it away easily! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the other person who gave him this opportunity. It is the king. This is also the place that makes him feel sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of John and Fu Kai frowned, slowly retreating. The range that can be dealt with from the Mithril sword - the king waving it like a sweeping maid wielding his broom, the table and chairs in the room are dumped, messy. There was a tip of the sword that passed over the base of the chandelier, which shook slightly. A few candles were extinguished, and the remaining flares undulating on the walls and resembling the tentacles and the shadows of the horns and teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fu Kai put his hand into his arms and held the rune. This is the only way for a non-caster to use a spell, as does the Duke of John. They are usually made into pins or pendants - Fukai's rune plate is a pin, shaped like a dragon holding its egg, and the disproportionate egg is a hollowed out jade. The rune depicting Mithril is the key to the entire rune, as long as the user breaks it or breaks it, it can trigger a spell inside it - it creates a shelter that can accommodate five people and is able to withstand the outside world. All kinds of damage and summon a wizard who works for Fukai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the Duke of John’s Obsidian Pendant is the same, but like Fukai, the Duke should have more unknown backhands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time when everyone was caught off guard, and if it wasn’t for Fukai who was always staring at the King and Birdwin, he must be the same as the Duke of John. Stunned at what he saw—Bedwin’s desperate and painful shouting, he grabbed the broken arm, and he was rolled by his king’s right arm at his feet—he smashed the fireplace’s protection The iron cover, half of the body fell into the charcoal fire, the flame burned to his hair, he burned up, he asked his master, to the king for help, and the king was indifferent, the Knight of Tyre caught the red sling (used to suspend the stove), the peeling flesh sticks to the iron sling and is burnt to sizzle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struggled, half-squatting out of the burning hell and rolling on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king threw another bronze bottle to him. He had no compassion for his former brothers, friends, and courtiers. His face was calm and peaceful, and he was wholehearted. The land will put Birdwin to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin groaned, gasping, he seemed to have lost all his strength, Penny took half of his hope, and his king was taking it The other half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After you die, I will let them expel you," the King said with joy. "You are not worthy of being a knight of Tyre. Your soul will wander endlessly on the plains of mourning until it becomes a devil or a devil's food." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Fukai, he couldn’t detect when Baldwin grabbed his sword again, the king gave him, the dwarf made The wide sword, just for a moment, the sharp tip of the sword has pierced the king's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king fell down, and blood and air sprang from the sly wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of John slammed his rune on the ground, and the obsidian was split and the spell was in effect, and the closed door was opened by the spell in the next moment, John The Duke's mage was the first to step into the room: "Catch him!" the Duke of John shouted: "Catch the Baldwin, he killed his majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In fact, there is no need to say anything, people have already seen it, and the Duke of John and Fukai can be said to stand against the wall of the room, protected by spells, and the body of the Earl of Kel and the body of the King’s body, Podwin Between them, holding the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first princess pounced on the king, she shivered and stroked his muscles, and leaned down to feel if he still had breathing, blood stained Her arms and chest, but she was unaware - she had seen too many dead people, she knew what the dead was like, "killed him," she raised her body and screamed: "Kill Bywin , kill this thief, this murderer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!" Li Ona screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wu’an Princess went back, she stood up without saying a word, went over, and waved her arm to give her niece a sly The slap in the face, the power of her own, she lost her balance, and Fukai’s mage helped her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will you kill him? Your Highness?" The Master of the Duke of John revoked the spell and asked with respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," the Duke of John took a deep breath and the room was hot and turbid. The smell of strong air made him stunned: "We need a fair and bright trial."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fukai's mage and attendant took Bedwin out of the room . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master of the Duke of John moved away from the Earl of Kel. When he wanted to move the king, he was stopped by Princess Diane: "Wait a minute," she said to her living brother and her lover: "I have something to say to you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke nodded and pulled out the handkerchief to suppress the urge to cough, and the room was empty again. Princess Diane hangs her arms exhaustedly: "Tell me, this is an accident. This result is not in any of your plans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is indeed an accident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Swear to the river in Crawford." Say. This is a bit of an excessive requirement. If you dare to lie to the river of the dead god, Krobo, it means lying to your own beliefs - as a false believer. Or an unbelievers, the liars will forever indulge in the bottom of the river dragging the rotten soul to mourn and cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fukai hesitated. This result is better than their expectations, but it is not within their original plan: "Swear to the river in Crawford."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then John The duke also took the oath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛安 took a deep breath and she sorted out her hair. The clothes are still very bad. But this is more of a ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened the door, and there were attendants and female officials outside the door, and they saluted her. When she saw the blood on her skirt, she changed her color, and Diane completely ignored them. She took a deep breath and shouted: "Pharaoh is dead, Long live the new king!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona walks through the dark corridor and hurries, she can’t believe her father Suddenly left herself, sadness and fear almost killed her, but she knew that she must persevere, she must, at least until she saved Bedwin and cleaned up his charges, she could not let her indulge in useless sorrow.中—She prayed to Siennos, hoping it was a bad nightmare, but she quickly disappointed, she found the elf in Kerry's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Ranger has not yet fallen asleep, his cloak is hung on a chair, but it is neatly dressed. Leona’s visit makes him both surprised and deep. Feeling ominous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bedwin..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to Byrdwin?" asked Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was accused of killing Pharaoh." The lich who was stepping into the room picked it up, he just killed one and wanted to use some of him... ... um... the "special" spell of the red powder mage, folded him and put it head-down into the castle's toilet, caught a little clues from the night wind, "Listen," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female official and the attendant have already transmitted this news to the outside world. "The old king is dead, the new king is long live." The shouts shook the entire king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think that the new king is not you, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last undead Leona said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words were understood by Liona as a blame: "Aunt Auntie will not support me - Birdwin was originally her shame. As for Other people..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They hate Baldwin," she whispered, "because my father has given him so much glory and wealth." Here...he only has you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you." Kerry Ben said: "How is Baldwin now?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was caught, Aunt Aunt wants to kill him, but my uncle and Fukai think that they need to be judged before they can make a final decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it really Badwin who killed the king?" the lich asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Absolutely not," Liona said firmly: "He will never lift arms to my father, the king he loyal to." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the Lich said: "If this is the case, then I suggest that we do it right away - no matter what we do."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," the undead who once said happily reminded: "Remember Yadel?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
