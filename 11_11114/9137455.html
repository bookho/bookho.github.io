			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the twenty-fifth day, one of the branches of the Three Armies led by Kremar has stood in the ruins of the last Principality.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another plane, using a shortcut of airplanes and tanks, a country that is surprisingly successful in a sudden attack, the longest one, with thirty-nine The day conquered a country of 670,000 square kilometers, the shortest one, conquered a country of nearly 50,000 square kilometers in one day - in this plane, except for the red dragon and the human face lion beast, the eagle The lion beast can almost be said to be the overlord of the entire sky, and the spells thrown by the warlocks on their backs are more terrible ammunition than gunpowder and steel. Although the deinonym is not comparable to the tank, it is compared to humans. For cold ice, non-human control can not move the attacking metal block, and the face of a beast with a fangs and teeth, is completely different. Simply analogy, there are many murderers, they are in the face I can still calmly think about the muzzle, but when I face the wolf dog who is screaming and screaming, she will cry and cry. Is the wolf dog more terrible than the bullet? If the artery is not torn, the bite of the wolf dog may not be fatal, but the bullet may not be necessary. This can only be said that the instinct of human beings is at work.And in this plane, they would rather play against a fully armed, strong and strong knight, and don’t want to test the claws and teeth of a Deinonychus as sharp as they are.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the Principality they conquered was not a weak regime that was constructed by three or five cities and large wilderness, and could be like the Grand Duke of Tilan. All the people are gathered together in the majesty of the Dagong, one or two, more is the Dagong in the fortress to raise less than half a hundred of the knights and about two or three times the soldiers of the knight, scattered in every place The so-called knights are even more pitiful. Their personal equipment may still be able to be used, and their enemies can also get horses and weapons, but their soldiers are picking up wooden spears (yes, the words are as they please, A sharpened branch), even civilians and serfs without shoes, what role can these people play in the real? If Dagong can disperse or relocate ordinary people in time, then recruiting scattered knights and soldiers may also block the one-and-a-half-time meeting, but the Grenada people are too fast, almost one night. Within them, they can make a city into complete silence, the lion's body and the wizard, the warlock's magic pets around the city, to ensure that no one can avoid their eyes to warn neighboring areas<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in such a city, an eagle lion is swaying under the nose and sniffing, while the knight on it is lazy The ground ran a long knife inlaid with a jewel in front of him. This is the trophy he got from another city. Really, he doesn't understand why Greedy wants to keep these people to the present, they are long ago. Can you do this, perhaps to fatten the pig? When he thinks of it, he can't help but reveal an evil smile. He must admit that these cities have indeed accumulated a lot of money and accumulated for hundreds of years. His skin has accumulated a lot more valuable than this long knife. Items - Just when he wanted to take them out, the lion's lion's beast stopped, and its thick four-claw pad made it sound a little while walking, but walking in When the rubble was rubbed, some tumbling stones and debris could not help but break the quiet night. Then, a short sob was caught by the lion and its owner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight of Dragon's Teeth licked his lips. He hangs his long knife back to his belt and takes out the steel spear. The eagle lion body stretches his neck and sniffs. Standing in front of a statue that seemed to be dumped because of the collapse of the house, the dragon tooth knight stretched out a spear and gently hit it on the statue of the alabaster. The echo came from him and raised his eyebrows. The spear continued to slide, stopped, and then inserted a narrow gap. He paused for a while, not out of kindness, but on the contrary, because he knew that the people inside were suffering more terrible torture than death. - But he didn't delay for too long. After all, he didn't want to get a share with uninvited colleagues... and...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eagle Lion The beast can feel the knight on his body tightening the muscles of his legs. It arches his back, stretches out his sharp claws, and firmly grasps the ground. It is only a very short glimpse. In the low shout, this statue It seems that there are more than 500 pounds of statues that are suddenly picked up by the spears, and the spears are drawn on the stones. Sound harsh disgusting, today's final residual Hui put the statue after dark, in many cases, light means life and hope, unfortunately, here, this time the light was a symbol of despair and death<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a knight with a meager dragon, even if there is only a meager light, he can clearly see the two people hugging each other in the dark. Class, an older woman, a young woman, in their arms is a third person, a baby<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of his mouth rises upwards, the short spear with a cold light points to the darkness, the young woman wants to come out, but one is more The older woman pushed back. She stuffed the baby into her daughter's arms and climbed out of the cellar. When she was completely exposed to the still bright place, the Cavaliers discovered that she should be a nobleman. Her skin was more delicate than civilians. The appearance is also more refined, messy, but the hair is soft, indicating that she has never suffered from hunger before. She trembles, but firmly walks to the place where the lion body is less than one arm, and jerkes up. Hands, opened his own clothes, and presented his entire upper body to the enemy: "Adults..." She said, she can hear that she is trying to be soft, but it is so strange to her that she only changes There was a sardonic smile from the Dragon Knight: "Adult," she continued, but the panic made her almost impossible to think of other words: "Adult..." she murmured repeatedly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
