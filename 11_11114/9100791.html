The souls of the outside world only felt black in front of them, and the pain like acupuncture was distributed on his eyes. He subconsciously raised his hand and held his own eyes. He touched a layer of cold stone. The strange touch made him stagnate, and the Kerry Ben around him opened his hands. The terrible face was exposed. In front of everyone - from his forehead to his cheeks, it turned into gray-black rocks, rocks and flesh and blood, bones rubbing, the fear and pain brought by the caster could not bear the trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard Perant say: "Don’t touch his face!" I can also feel that Kerry Ben immediately put himself down and let himself halfway down in him. On the knees, and Valentin shouted: "Break, go to the pastor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have...reel..." The soul struggled to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your eyes are petrified," Kerry Ben held his hands and said in his ear: "Therapeutic spells are difficult for Medusa. Petrochemical gaze has utility, don't be afraid, the dwarves have pastors, they pray for a god to their gods... Don't move, petrified parts will damage more places inside..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world heard the heavy footsteps are rushing away, and the pain is intensifying, not because the petrochemical part of Kerry’s said that it has collided with the non-petrochemical part to create new damage. But because the pure positive energy in his body is making his body heal quickly, whether it is a lack of organs or limbs - when it leaves the Bibi dike to the White Tower, the body in the underground waterway has been seriously The wound, but because the wound was deep and the blood vessels, the positive energy surging in the blood could not be added to the body in time, and the priest Yasal of Rosada quickly cast a prayer to the magic, so it did not cause Others’ suspicions, but now, only petrified The eyeballs and the skin and the bones of the surface, replacing their new tissue, are like the vines pressed under the slate, so they want to push the petrified part out, but it can't let other people see it. The person who has the ability to heal the abilities is probably only the devil lord or the demon lord, such as Grazite. It does not want them to think that the blood of this body has a sulphur smell, but it cohabits with it. They don't want them to guess his true identity - it's even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry only felt that the chest was fiercely beaten by the dwarf's hammer. His hand consciously loosened, and then it was empty. Kremar jumped from his shackles and worried him the most. When the thing was born, the caster put his finger on the eye and grabbed the petrified part before everyone reacted. The blood infiltrated his sleeve, and the dwarf Valentine rushed over and tried to catch him. However, the black caster has already crushed a rune seal, and the magic contained in the rune bursts like a thunder. The burning white light suddenly makes everyone fall into a darkness, and their vision is finally restored. One point, now Kreima has left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who saw him?" Valentin shouted, he was more worried about his people, a vision was impaired, and his mind did not seem to So the sober caster is too dangerous for the dwarves, especially if he is invited as a friend, and the dwarf who meets him may be alert and prepared for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan saw it, or more correctly, didn’t see it, was in the thief’s vigilance, and he retired when Kremar fell into arrogance In a shadow, so the least harm, he can feel a bloody wind from his left side, he saw plum, no, the only girl who uses the body of plum honey seems to want To say something, he immediately stood up and put his finger on the skull - he almost guessed that this god was not as powerful and terrible as the elves, and in the war of the soul, she even had plum However, even after trying to assassinate her - not so much as she forgives Gülen, it is better to say that she is jealous of them, he does not think that this goddess can find a second body, at the very least, has The body of the companions of Kerry Ben and Kremar and others - they are special, the thieves can feel, leaving them, the weak goddess is afraid to escape, so she is only patient and patient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman of love only stopped, she also noticed the strangeness of this caster, but she is not ready to destroy the already precarious balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does Medusa's petrified gaze affect the mind of the subject?" Kerry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should not," Perant said. "But I haven’t encountered anyone who has suffered petrochemical gaze from the peeping eye, the special monster. Attacks have always been extremely wonderful, and no one knows what they will look like after a spell is distorted..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have let my dwarves go "By the way, warn them not to approach the half-elf," Valentin said, sadly about to lose his beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the black caster has climbed to the top of the dwarf hall under the guidance of the undead. As he described before, the dwarf's hall and square are like hanging on a huge stalactite. This is of course not the case. This huge cave is not a natural cave, but a dwarf. The building is the result of their careful mapping and carving. At the top of the hall is a rugged stone wall, but you only have to Close, you can see that these bumps are huge statues, there is a war between the dwarf gods and other gods, each statue is as big as hundreds of dwarves, the soul of the outside world endures pain and new organization Itching during growth, quickly dig a small hole in the shadow of a god, and hide the cheeks, and the eyes are still a little bit worse. The taste is hard to say, almost letting it dig out again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood, spoiled tissue and tears flow down together, the soul of the outside world once again feels the abominable oppression and helpless loneliness, This body has friends, there are also ethnic groups, and subordinates, but at a critical moment, no one can believe it, no one can rely on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After noisy looking for a grid (an hour), the dwarves found a black caster in a closed ramp: "He looks bad." Extremely." The collapse said: "It’s dirty, smelly, and sad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what to say when Crimalor wakes up, one The dwarf thought he was dirty, stinky, and sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Perant moved him to Kerry’s back, Kreima briefly woke up for a while, thanking Druid, Rui’s heart was slightly lowered, no matter what kind of spells had been hit before, at least it seems that this effect has been faded or eliminated – the dark night-like eyes are still closed, but after being wiped clean People are happy that his skin and bones have returned to their original state, and Kerry has rejected the dwarf priest to immediately cast the gods - after all, if the dwarves are to participate in this war according to Valentin's plan, they What is needed is assistance, not replacement, those injured dwarves will need magic to treat them - when he puts his finger on the eyelids, he can clearly feel the rounded eyes below, and the eyes are still slightly The vibrations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He may have treated himself." Kerry Ben said that he knows that Cremari has a potion that is more miraculous than the water of life. Perhaps this is a secret. He told himself that he did not want to deprive Crimmar of his right to keep the secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He just seemed to be epileptic," said the collapsed smile. "I ate bad mushrooms." Then he took Kerry and didn't pay attention, learning to put his fingers on Krymar's eyelids, feeling He laughed even more when the eyelids trembled, but before Valentin screamed, he yelled and screamed three feet as high, and quickly hid behind Valentin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar opened his eyes, and his eyes were still as beautiful as obsidian or coal, leaving no regrets. Oh, just like nothing has ever been born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you remember the previous thing?" Perant asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I seem to... confused for a while." The soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think he needs to take a break," Valentin said, maybe there is still treatment, the old dwarf who has survived this scale for thousands of years. The dwarves who had been knocked on by the stone had a bad problem since then. Because there was no bleeding, they didn’t even go to the pastor to treat the potion, but the things in their heads were broken. Many of them were forced to cast a god. It was only treated well after surgery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valentin’s proposal was supported by Kerry Ben and Perant, who took out a bottle of water of life and snow honey in exchange for the dwarf The priest was an elder who braided his beard into a black and white garden. He cast a magical spell. "Okay," he watched the bodies of the light-spotted sorcerer. "No problem, hello." He Habitually hammered the caster's chest, just like after treating each dwarf. The soul of the alien world only feels a bit sullen. To be honest, if the body is not the blood of a dragon, the dwarf priest may have wasted a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black caster rested all night, and when the lich came to take over, the body was no longer a problem, in the room where the dwarf prepared for the guest. Valentin and they discussed the next plan, um, with the ale and nuts, the nuts eat the most with the collapse behind Valentin, a room with his teeth and hard hazelnut shells and walnuts The crisp sound of the shell colliding with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the very least, we know who our enemy is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A group of cavemen, A Medusa." Valentin said that the old dwarf took the opportunity to stop all the dwarves' work and concentrate the dwarves in the hall. On the top and walls of the hall, the ground was covered with black iron plates, so that at least they The life will not be damaged. The problem is that the dwarves who are used to busy work and work are constantly trying to slip away, returning to their cars, the anvil and the furnace, and finally Valentin has to take out all the stock of ale, let They enjoyed drinking, and the result was that the hall was full of alcohol, and the hall was full of dwarfs, but this method could not last too long. Three days was the limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
