			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer city of Norman is the widest street in the entire northern city, the width of the street allows ten horses and their picks to gallop side by side, even In this way, it is still occupied by people who come to watch and participate in the ceremonial parade. Under their crowds, the ivory and rose stone Fro statues are slow, and Fro’s priests need to spend the previous double The strength of the times, but they can not complain about it - just as the soul of the outside world is seen in the port of Minato, the caravan carrying the statue also has the same hail-like coins, and because of the Norman kings The residents of the outer city are almost all aristocrats and wealthy businessmen. Most of the coins are gold coins, and there are some precious jewelry. Most of them come from daughter-in-law and lovers. They are rushing to jump on the wheel and kiss and touch the gods* * Part, pray that you can get the long-lasting favor of your clients. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Norman hasn’t been so busy for a long time," said Princess Long, who was sitting on the window while overlooking the scenery below. Shaking his own peacock hair fan, the sapphire and rock on the fan shine like a ray of light in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pharaoh is dead," said her son, Dylan Don Clay, as if she had not noticed that Princess Diane had seen the recent triumph in nothing: "Long live the new king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really right," said Princess Long, after the fan, "They need this." - Long-lasting missed a piece of rotten meat in the earth can not be considered a good idea - your majesty is very smart, ah, perhaps the award should be Fukai, even if he did not intervene, at the very least, the new statue And the priest Fro, who is surrounded by the idols, those fresh and beautiful faces should be carefully selected from his goods. Do you know this?"<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I have been busy integrating my team these days." Dylan said: "In order to arrest the daring sinner, the madman who killed the pharaoh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Princess Chang’an is finally willing to give her son a positive eye: "Don’t be me In front of me, Dylan, in my memory. You were a little baby just barely before, I remember you insisted on hiding in my skirt once, and once I hid the sugar in the pillow, the result was called A bed of ants, and you. You also lost the face with a puppy. I am your mother, not your subordinate or Fukai."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan showed a helpless look: "Nothing, Mom." He said intimately: "It's just that we don't want you to hurt this thing - I and my Majesty want to build a mage group."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Somewhat heard," said Princess Longan, "Then the hybrid is just a cover. Who do you want to hide? Elf?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thunderbolt is a human relationship," said Dylan. "Highland Norman is the domain of mankind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... ...I want to use the division to replace the elves," princess Princess Anan thought: "And, the Norman and the Silver Crown jungle covenant..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is a long time later.” Dylan interrupted her: “This is not something that can be done in a decade or two.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Ann Princess said, then she put this topic deep inside: "...when are you going to go," she said: "Maybe you and other young people." Go and vote for one or two gold coins to see if you like someone, Dylan, you are an adult, even if you are not prepared to enter into a marriage contract with someone, then you should have a few lovers..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan took a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suddenly remembered that my tutor had a task to do for me. I must go right away or the tutor would be very upset. He is not ready to stay in Norman. I have a lot of questions for a long time and I want to get him. I am sorry that my mother, I think I have to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fukai thinks so too!" Princess Ang’s princess slammed into the open door and said, “I will discuss this with him!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Master is quite equivalent to him A rare emergency posture fled from his mother's room, until he got out of the shadow of the gorgeous palace, he was able to breathe a long breath, and Princess Dian is Dylan. Don Cray is on the mainland. One of the few people who would hurt, and the ranking is still very high, he is not willing to make her sad. But what he does not need now is not including his wife or lover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed his fingers and cast a trick so that he was less noticeable - and then he went to his mentor’s mage tower, nominally Dylan It is the owner of this tower. But in essence, Dylan's mentor is the real user of it - the tower of the red robe Austal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage tower stands on the edge of the outer city. It is not a very noisy place to say, but some of the daughters dressed as Fro are playing with a few stunned children who are about a few hundred feet away from the tower. Maybe They think the distance between the two is far enough, but Dylan doesn't think so. He hid his hands in his wide sleeves and recited a spell. A group of mice suddenly jumped out of the bushes and turf, frantically biting everyone, and those people immediately fled with bloody wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a near-conventional saying that the shadow cast by the Master Tower is the location of the owner of the tower, and he can throw a spell to drive or It is the place to kill the invaders, but it is also said to be standing on the top of the Tower of the Master. The place where the Master's vision is - Dylan's mentor Austal, and other prudent red robes are of course the latter. But Austal seldom drives his own power. He always comes and goes, and when he finishes his own work, he will use the spell to leave quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dylan walked into the tower about a hundred feet, the seemingly ordinary thorns and ground vines were not noticeably trembled slightly Their tentacles are slightly lifted up, just like the viper spit out the core and tastes the smell of the air, carefully confirming the identity of the person. Dylan's breath is familiar, allowed to enter, they hang down the branches, docile He watched him come to the Master Tower and was so high in front of the ground, making gestures to cast his own spells to float himself, so that he was casting the black iron, filling the door of Mithril Rune, he played the mentor. The magic mark, after a moment, the door opened, allowing Dylan to enter, there are four metal statues at the bottom of the tower, when the nominal master walks into them, they open the eyes that were originally closed. And raise the weapon in your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan stretched out his hands without panic, and sang a curse that was very long and sloppy (just like the name of his mentor), this The paragraph spell contains hundreds of syllables, as long as one is wrong. Those magical figures with beautiful amethyst gemstone eyes will be treated as enemies of the invasion in the future. Of course, the disciples of Red Robe Austal will not make such stupid mistakes, and the Golem will get the correct spell, among them. One opened the door to the spiral staircase for Dylan, which seemed to never be in the same position in Dylan's impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance leads Dylan, and its body ignites a whirl of negative energy. For Dylan, the steps under the feet were illuminated, one step, up to two steps, and the other steps were hidden in the thick black lead. The blame directed Dylan to a silver door leaf with a soft glow. Dylan pushed it away. The room inside was the favorite and most important thing of his mentor. It was an open room and a wall. It is a row of bookshelves, and the other wall is also a shelf with hundreds of crystals and glass jars. The third wall, like other casters, has a copying table with a steel ruler on both sides, a scroll and a wand stand, but unlike the ordinary mage, there is a square in the center of the room made of a whole piece of obsidian. The altar, the reason why it can be recognized at a glance is that it is an altar rather than a table, because it has a blood trough around it, and the funnel of the blood trough is engraved into the mouth of the devil. The blood of the sacrifice flowed down from the mouth, and fell into the dragon claw cup on the corner of the altar. The cup was blood chalcedony, the chalcedony was dark gray-green, and the middle was mixed. The flamboyant crimson point is hard to say whether it was originally made or blood-stained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a bit noisy." The red robe warlock said that he had a cup, not a blood chalcedony but a malachite - a heart filled with unborn babies, which were only as big as peanuts. Squeezing and squeezing together, driven by magic potions, each is beating vigorously and healthyly, just as they are still in the warm body of their owners, and their owners are still in the mother’s belly. Sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to order them to spread out." Dylan said respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," said the red robe warlock. "Today is the first day of the Froday. And I am not prepared to stay in Norman for too long." Come help me clean my heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan whispered a spell to ensure that his hands were clean and the long sleeves that fell were invisible The servant rolled up and fixed it with a pin. He looked at the baby's heart on the plate. "Is it necessary to extract the fiber? The instructor." He took out the tiny silver plate from the prepared silver plate, which was long and thin, and the tip was not as flexible as a fishbone or like a bird. Hard crochet, pencil, scissors and other necessary tools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Half of the fiber is extracted, half of the bait is made." The red robe warlock said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, mentor." Dylan said that all his attention was immediately bet on the work at hand - whether it was the extraction of fibers (weaving rich The fabric of the magic) is still making bait (in order to lure the inferior and the little devil), the blood vessels and nerves buried deep in the heart need to be cleaned, and the blood clots that are condensed cannot be found. Of course, the smaller the heart, the smaller the work. The more difficult it is, especially the magic potions that preserve their vitality, and they are smooth, powerful, and even flee from the hands of unskilled apprentices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Badwin is still in your sight?" Dylan’s mentor asked, he went back to the front of the bookshelf and opened a book with gems and gold. The big book (he cast a spell to make it float), Dylan carefully removed his eyes, all the spells on this shelf are accompanied by magic, and those who want to peek into the secret without permission will be taken away and even Life, as early as ten years ago, Dylan witnessed a servant's servant's servant's servant's smoldering flames burned into a black and stinking ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Dylan is very eager to get one of them, his mentor is a red robe, a warlock who uses his blood to cast spells, but Dylan knows that he has knowledge. Exceeding any of the wizards he saw, this is why, as a warlock, he still can teach Dylan and White Tower's Demon to become a mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king's knight and the army tracked them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robe warrior smiled and said: "As far as I know, the despicable human being is in Norman's army. It has a high prestige, and many people think that he is wronged, even if his god has already abandoned him outside the door - there are still many people who think so, you think they will really complete the new king and give them to them. "Task?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what the new king should do," Dylan pinched with his dexterous fingers a small, non-stop The heart, pull the happy room with a large crochet, pull the blood vessels out of the small crochet, and then peel them off with a pen knife: "If he is careless about this, someone will think that he is not related to the death of Pharaoh, or that he is at least I am happy to see this - anyway, there are me and the Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you be sure that you got the message?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They didn't enter the city," Dylan said. "As soon as you enter the city, there are villagers. The lord confessed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too slow," said Ostal, while his hand, his head, Viony, the head of Anemos Press it down, "It will burn your eyes," he warned the little devil who wanted to glimpse the contents of the book. It wasn't that he didn't want it to have a proper lesson, but there are still many things to do. Like Dylan: "I will help you find them," he said. "This is a good thing to understand as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not grateful, My mentor," Dylan said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I have more important things to do for you." Ostar said softly, he closed the big book and let it go back to the original Position: "Very important - I believe you will do well." He walked over to the Obsidian's altar and admired the bright red muscles that were still twitching. "You can always do well. Dylan, my disciple," he raised his hand and gently patted Dylan's back: "It's a pity that you only have the blood of a mortal, my child, otherwise I would love to see how you are." Become a noble and powerful warlock - just like me."
