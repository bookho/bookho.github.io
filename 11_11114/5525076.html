			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief’s body has lost its balance. He quickly twists his body in the air, bends his knees after landing, slams, shouts, and pops the finger between his fingers. The knife, inserted into the gap between the rope and the ankle, the other hand tried his best to cast the sharp dagger to the enemy he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dagger crossed the air and hit the statue of Mask, the neck of the statue was broken, and the falling head broke the palm of his hand, maybe this is A little irritated Mask, who was watching here, the steel finger knives did not play a role in Gülen’s freedom - the assaulter was intact, and it faithfully and conscientiously fulfilled the master’s orders, the snakes were generally agile and flexible Going around and tightening, Gülen was so embarrassed that his left hand was sandwiched between the two ankles, his right hand was forced to press his left shoulder, his knees against his chest, and a silvery shimmering rope deep into his skin. And in the muscles, he looks like a otter that only strays into the net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rope was not held in the palms of both hands, it was alive. When this cognition broke into the thief's mind like a thunder, he found that his shouts were as weak as the mosquitoes shaking their wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mage, he is in his heart, he is facing a caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a candle lit up quietly, someone sitting on Gülen’s favorite chair with a spell book on his leg, that’s Ge Lan was stolen from a careless wizard. The spell book was useless to him, but he kept it carefully and prepared to exchange it at a crucial moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a gray leather cloak and black hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Gülen can still get it, then now it’s already frozen, all the way down, pulling him all The internal organs. The owner of the blunt pub described him to him, and Gülen also saw his face through the peephole—just as he and Captain Drake walked out of the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had previously considered whether the guild’s mage was tempted by other people to deal with him, and now he does not know that it is worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a conspiracy!" the thief shouted: "This is a conspiracy against us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;The lich’s gaze shifted from the book to Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person who attacked you," the thief continued to say "loudly", "One of them is my nephew."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But he shouldn’t have been there, he’s my sister’s child, I don’t want him to be a thief, so I gave her a sum of money, Let her son learn literacy and numeracy - he has not been trained, has not been taught, and at least sneaked a few breads in the alley with other children - and like that temptation The stranger’s work should not be done by him. He was taught, and I was concealed. I didn’t know anything about it. I was unprepared. When I learned the unfortunate news, I thought he was Innocent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you later learned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am preparing to contact German Rick, the god of thieves is on, I swear! Even at the beginning I didn't let him kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is probably because you have A better way to dispel your grievances.” The caster leaned back slightly: “The venerable Captain Drake is indeed a businessman, but he obviously sells more than silk. And fur, except for his own life, he sells everything - including you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He must sell me very clean." Thieves full of resentment Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Correct," said the Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Captain Drake and his ship are so famous, the Master may not need to change a boat, but in fact, Dr. Drake’s boat simply cannot When he enters Bibi Dibao, he will not go to the net. He has an elf in his cargo list. The Master feels that he must applaud the captain's courage. In another plane, the elf will often be Depicted as a group of gentle, elegant and beautiful, with long life and excellent physique, but rarely conscious and courage to protect their little pity, they seem to only sing and dance all the time, drink spring water, weave garlands, look forward to Being rescued by a man or woman (a human!) - the lich cannot understand the contradictions it sets, but at least here, the vast majority of wise creatures will wisely not face a hostile elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a race with a life span that can almost compete with the dragon. The mind is clever, the eyes are sharp, the limbs are powerful, the reaction is quick, the memory is incredible, and there is a growth period of 100 to 150 years to ensure Their energy costs are equivalent to a human being who has twice the time from birth to death to accumulate knowledge, experience, experience and combat skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, they don’t have a country, but they have kings and the army; they form a loose but reliable alliance with the surrounding city-states, they trade with humans, and with gnomes and dwarves There are contacts (although they and the dwarves hate each other); they expel the goblins, drive away the ogre, the giant, and the orcs; chase the thieves, smugglers, kill the unscrupulous merchants and mages, and go to the hips Shooting arrows...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Of course, the lich denied the annoyance, although he was surprised that the guy who was better than the goblin could actually tell the position of the hip bone ( That's right, it's the ass) - that's a servant of my mentor. After he sent himself back to the tower, the mentor almost smiled and smashed the bones of the whole body - he described it with gusto, it was a delicate magic arrow. With the baby's pink light, the Mithril arrow, the milky white arrowstick depicts the golden magic runes, and the tail feathers are cut from the grinning kingfisher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Imagine that the soul of the opposite world said, then he found a place to laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone really gets an elf, like our Captain Drake, the Lich then thinks - can only say 10,000 smart people Will give birth to one or two fools. A screaming black-haired chick, thinking that he knew everything, could do anything, but was easily put down by a cup of pear wine with a hypnotic potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the Master, she will be sold directly by Captain Drake to a gray robe, red robe, or an orc priest, she will be long-lasting Torture, miserable death, the soul can not be free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Captain Drake and the Lady of Gold need to change their names as soon as possible and succumb for a while, but considering the astounding gains (not only It is only gold coins), which is still very worthwhile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, he can be said to be bloodless, but also have to come up with more gold coins to ensure that they can get strong and strong shelter - that black The anger of the little chicks can burn the entire port of Mind, and the thieves are not a kind of compassionate person who will be generous enough to let a guy who sells himself still enjoy the holidays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
