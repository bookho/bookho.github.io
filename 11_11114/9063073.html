"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An answer to him is a silver cup that is suddenly slammed on the ground, where the splash of honey is everywhere, and the silver cup inlaid with pearls falls to the ground." Then, with a crisp sound, he jumped up from the ground and kneeled on the head of a slave. The sharp corners opened a bloody mouth in his eyes. He immediately climbed his hands and feet and used his own The arm wipes off the dripping blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Naga is more gloomy than her nominal employer, the lord of the East Crown. "Before this work is done, no."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have twelve casters now," said the lord. "If you need it, I have two exiled mages here. They can replace the after the completion of Kremar." "Work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Naga said angrily: "No, not because of work," their plan was to kill the side of the work. The new owner of the island - the excuse of Naga is thinking about it. When the energy is full, the lower-level fire element elves are easily assimilated. After assimilation, it is not extinct or become more powerful, but in the process of fire elements Creatures often fall into a chaos that approximates blanks, as they were when they were born, they no longer recognize their masters, anyone who approaches them will be attacked - and a warlock and a mage who come to the East Crown Has accepted the bribe of the East Crown lord - if it is They are going to attack their employers. They may ask for more than ten times the reward to be willing, but now they are only murdering an outsider who has no identity and qualifications. The latter’s mentor has been determined to have died. No one wants to trace the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can throw the black hair caster to the fire elemental creatures in the riots and mourn the friends of Kremar. Then they are driven out one by one. As for the Normans in the Highlands, if they are willing to pledge allegiance to the lord, they can stay, but if not, their children will be thrown into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The witness we summoned is a master of the devil," said Naga. Carefully avoiding Graz's name and biting his nails angrily. If one of the last things the casters want to do is probably explain what they are doing to the mortal: "He is a demon, even if people are Say he is the most demon-like demon. But he is still a moody, changeable, unpredictable demon - if it is a devil, I dare to try it, but a demon. Who knows if he is waiting for us? Make a mistake?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord is silent, he has not seen the demon with his own eyes, but he still knows the temperament of this evil disordered creature, given that they are often called the devil and the devil by the white robes who are too soft and soft, and one master Even human beings are enough to be deeply disturbed, the paradox of demons? Naga is doing the right thing, although he doesn't know how Naga will summon a demon, but he doesn't want to show too much ignorance in front of the female warlock. "When are we going to wait?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the head of the sea demon hangs on the outer wall of the Bibi Dyke, the lord has already confessed to handing the side island to a powerful mage - the little black hair Hybrids shouldn't be so strong. No one of Beavis’s ability is better than him. As a disciple, a mage with a mouthful name has only been studying with him for several years. He has changed to be a more clumsy person. The years have not been enough for him. From an apprentice to a disciple. Moreover, Beavis is still busy revenge for his wife and unborn children. How much time and experience can he teach a child? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​the lord is wonderful. He gives the gold-like side island to a foreigner who has no help except two or three friends, and his The sons, the puppies who have already coveted the side islands, will certainly be unwilling to go to bite - he can't give the island to any of the eight sons. Now their power, except for the smallest Amos, can basically be said to be flat, but if one of them has a side island. Then he wants to swallow others will be much faster than expected, and when a son reduces his brother to two or three, his eyes will fall on his old father - but the lord also Can not continue to hold the side of the island, this gold in the hand will also let his son focus on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn’t think that the new owner of the side island would have an army that could compete with any of the lords of the Dragon Fire Island so quickly. They came from Norman, a distant highland, with their families. It is said that they had been fighting with the orcs of the Whistling Plain for ten or twenty years before being expelled by their lords, and that their old lords were the one-armed warriors who had been following Craigar, the one called Bywin. When the lord heard the news, he could almost feel that the cold blade was stuck on his neck. After the soldiers and the knights successively defeated several "pirates" who had come to the side to plunder, the lord could even feel it. To the pain, what frustrated him was that his sons had wisely chosen to give in after successive heavy blows. They huddled and turned a blind eye to the changes in the side islands, and even a few started the opposite side of the island. The new owner, the black hair caster, shows off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Beavis's father wants to see is that they are both defeated, not in a sweet state as they are now - perhaps they will really collude together in the next moment, and then it is his own danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We intend to do it in the ceremonies," Naga said. "At that time the contract was completed, and the demon master who was the witness and the supervisor must return to the bottomless. Abyss..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the mage we hired, and the warlock," the lord interrupted her impatiently: "What do they do, once they are done? They have to leave the East Crown immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as Crimmar doesn't leave," Naga said, "You are not going to hold a grand event." The ceremonies and all your sons are required to participate. The Master is not your son, but he is the heir to your son. He accepted your gift-ground. You have the right to ask him to stay until the end of the ceremonies."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord thought for a moment, perhaps, if the caster who killed the black hair at the ceremonies, maybe the storm and the god of the ocean, Talos, will be happy that they have such a noble The sacrifice... "What are you going to do?" He asked: "How many people do you need?"<br /><br />&nb Sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let your soldiers, or casters, kill, or, at the very least, entangle the few people around him," Naga said. "All that is left to me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I don't believe you," the lord said after a moment of indulging: "But Naga. You should know that a caster will run if he is willing to run away." Soon, if you are alone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Specifically, there can be no one," Naga said: "I have mine. Master, in addition, there will be a lot of help for me in a few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My blood." Naga said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Do you feel it? The soul of the opposite world said, I always feel uneasy, especially when Naga approaches me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Dragon blood. The Lich said in a nutshell that the dragon's blood in her body is nearing its peak. It ignites the dragon's blood in my body - that time may be advanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-? The soul of the alien world hesitated for a while - if I said wrong, please don't hit my face. It says, you mean that you have it every month? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Why should I hit your face, the lich answers in amazement, your poor brains are barely reliable, but unfortunately, It’s all right, for her, this can be a gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The soul of the alien world endured a little, and finally swallowed the words that had been sent to the lips. It doesn't think the Lich will appreciate his speculation, but the doubts in his heart are about to overflow—what gift? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I don’t know how much dragon blood is in her body, but the mixed blood may only be human blood, and the blood of the dragon will also be related to humans. The blood pulsation, but the consequences are totally different from me - I will become weak, and she will become violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——......This seems a bit unfair, the soul of the outside world muttered, you lost blood, and she added blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich does not understand, but he can probably figure out what it means - so to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——She can feel you...hey. weak? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If at that time our previous distance is too close, it will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If I am her, the soul of the opposite world says, I will not miss this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I think so too. The lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Naga at this time is still unable to smell the black hair caster The usual smell, but when she personally came to convey the intention of the Eastern Crown lord, she turned a little doubtful look after turning around - perhaps because the dragon's blood is almost close to the boiling point, her senses are now more acute than usual. Several times, perhaps because of the Dragon's Warlocks in the casters of other islands? But when they appeared, they were sniffed by Naga, and the blood on them was not as strong as that of Ruiyi. The female warlocks soon became devoid of glory, and those who were almost indistinguishable from humans could not match a gold coin in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had just left the black spellcaster's residence, and the caster called the thief Gülen into his room. He handed Glan a rune plate. The rune plate only had the size of both hands, but the thickness was amazing. From the side, you can see it. It is actually a stack of seven layers of thin plates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German licked his lips nervously, and he felt that his master was a bit crazy - but the bottomless abyss is down, which is really exciting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a rune seal against defensive energy and physical damage. It doesn't need to be broken or reversed. It's triggered." The Lich says he will be one. The ring was handed over to Gülen. This is his work. Fortunately, his magic has finally recovered to more than half of the original. This is the rune seal he has engraved on the side island, but the original It is intended to leave it to Gülen. In any case, the thief has occupied a very important position in his future plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gullan took the ring and immediately put it on his thumb, then bent his thumb into the palm of his hand and held it tightly, but after a moment he thought about it again. Put it in a firm Mithril chain, then hang it around your neck and put it in your shirt to avoid being seen on the one hand, and to prevent accidental loss on the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When should I do this?" asked the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you can't see me," the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that your plan is bound to be perfect," thief Gülen asked boldly. "But I can know about it? About what you want to see." The result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich looked at him unexpectedly, and among the people he did have a special eye for the thief, perhaps because it only helped him. Curiosity, but there is really nothing to hide: "Do you like the island?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like." The thief said that beauty, wealth, peace, and no thieves union - before he did not establish one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let it really belong to us." Once the undead said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jier coughed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
