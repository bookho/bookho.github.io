			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a two-legged cross-sail that is known as the “small bird”. It’s far less comfortable and beautiful than the Dr. Drake’s gold lady. No., but it is a new ship with ten sails. When it is windy, it will not run slower than the latter. Its captain is a middle-aged man of forty or fifty years old. His shoulders are wide and he is brown. The face is easily reminiscent of a copper coin that has been used for a long time. The dark brown cloak is wearing a silver medal symbolized by Woking. He has some doubts and defenses. He cannot refuse the leader of the Thieves Guild. Asked, but he really didn't like having such a troublesome character to stay on his boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the first sun shines on the top of the main squad, an old sailor who is trusted by the captain yells at other people who are anchoring The winch is in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to sing a song?" asked a sailor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you sing?" His companion said, "Our guests will like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Then a yellow-eyed sailor slammed the planks under his feet and made a bright head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Pull the cable! It’s scary! Hey!"?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗬!" Sailor They should be in harmony with each other and press their body against the winch bar that is inserted into the head of the winch. "Hey! Long cable! You are useless!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Great guys! Grab the rope! Oh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meat - tearing! Tops - broken! The back is covered with scars! It’s so bad! The scorpion is brownish red! The back is lower! Let's get started, good guys, only the last lap! The old and the young are together! Without exception! Pull it! Tighten! Call it right. ~"(Note: The poem is taken from the Internet)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are in the same circle, the winch is twisting and the anchor is slamming, The anchor was dragged onto the deck and hung on the bow. The paddler waved the oars in places that people could not see. Under the precise command of the pilots, the sailboats and the ropes of other ships were slow and calm. Exit Head, in the open waters turn a quarter turn, Zhang began to sail towards the established routes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun began to get hot, and the sea breeze tried to turn this burning into a damp cold. The little bird flew in the calm sea, and the port was quickly left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guests outside the plan take back the sight of the distance, he is Leaning against the ship's side in a relaxed and casual manner, the cloak squats behind the shoulders. The white robes on the body are dazzling in bright light like a handful of ice and snow, but the black eyes are more than before leaving Hong Kong. The peace and quiet, the captain did not know why he had such a strange idea, but it is true, he is more willing to talk to this person than the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir," the captain repeated: "Where do you want to dine, your room? Or my room?" He leaned over to his passengers. After a trip, his hands were hidden under the short cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain’s room is the largest on the entire boat, except for his bedroom, which has a living room for meetings and for all crew members to eat; Master The single cabin was originally a mate, with windows. It can be said to be clean and comfortable after being cleaned up, but it can only be put down on a bed and a table that can only put down two arms. He wants to dine in his own room, he has to make good use of his knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your room." He took out the magical pendant that was once the owner of the blunt pub (it was used by thieves to offset part of the debt), slightly The light is not prominent in the sun, but the gems of the eleventh grid have changed from the deep sea blue to the cornflower blue. For lunch, this time is a bit early, but the Master immediately thought that this might be the captain's intention, so that this uninvited guest can quietly dine alone, for him, the captain and the crew, It’s all good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the captain and the caster were walking on the bumpy deck, the watchman on the first floor of the first floor suddenly shouted: "Northeast Weibei, whale , two!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then his colleagues followed and shouted: "Northeast, three, killer whale!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"North Weidong, one, killer whale!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"East Weinan, killer whale, four!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive me." The captain said that he put on his hat, took out the binoculars from his pocket, and walked to the side of the ship to observe the rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I be blunt," his passenger said. "The whale's hunting list does not seem to include humans."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said the captain. "But they will play, chasing, hitting or flipping are their masterpieces - especially when the whales are mostly male whales. Just like human children running on the streets, they will have no day and night, no scruples, chasing one by the madness, jumping and jumping, not paying attention to what happened or what was hit - They can crush or shred the entire boat or a single boat at once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the big ship?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the three- and four-boats may not be overturned, but they will still be knocked out of the crack," the captain said. "They can even hit the lead plates. And they are both large and Heavy, even if it is a four-foot-long five-masted ship, that is, the length of ten killer whales, don’t mention narwhals, baleen whales, and blue whales,” he shook his head. “You must be worried about these big guys. . Italy and prudent "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Then he would fingertips near the forehead, once again apologized before leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I think he still likes me a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Every living creature will be willing to approach you, the Lich says, of course, the positive energy that reshapes this body has never left, it still Surging in your blood and bone marrow, it is warm and disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What did the attack in Jianjian Port say? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The lich gives a loud sneer, I think they are already very gentle to you, he said, you know, the smell on your body is stinking. The smell is exactly the same as the white robe priest and paladin who loves to do nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Is it the same as you? The soul of the alien world smiled and said that he is not the kind of idiot who can only bear the refusal to fight back. He knows that this sentence can make the lich quiet for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich was so silent that he left a bitter sneer and sank into the depths of consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer whales and whales have caught up with the "small bird" before the wizard's magical item has yet to pass through the two grids. It is easy to distinguish them. The water column of the whale is very high, only a bunch, and the tiger The whale's water column is much lower and spreads out, and the black and white killer whales are much more lively than the steady gray whales. They leap between the peaks of the valley, gliding, screaming and screaming, screaming and screaming, colliding with each other, kissing each other, flipping in the air, knocking huge waves with their tails, turning circles, touching The nose, in short, as long as humans want to come up with tricks that they can’t think of, they will all play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world is almost fascinated with everything in front of him. In his own world, only professionals and rich people can be fortunate in such a close distance. Observing a free and wild killer whale - there are several killer whales that can be said to be swimming close to the hull of the "Little Bird", the paddles are only a stone's throw away from them; their companions are not far away Jumping out of the water and falling back, the waves provoked the ship to swing back and forth like a gyro that was about to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors were surprised to find that he could walk as easily as they could on the swaying deck, a large wooden bucket filled with apples from the ropes. Out of it, it jumped on the deck, the lid shattered, and the apple rolled everywhere—until the little bird's guest accurately grasped the iron ring welded to the hoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow-eyed sailor rushed up to help him lift and fix the heavy wooden bucket. When they face each other, the mage is puzzled in the yellow The fear was seen in the eyes, and the sailors shouted in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can figure out when their passengers turned around, everything happened in the blink of an eye - a little tiger close to adulthood The whale jumped out of the water, while the other, the killer whale, which has twice as many of its size, followed it to jump. When the little killer whale jumped to the highest point and was about to fall, the adult killer whale accurately topped its belly. The little killer whale jumped up for the second time, in the air, directly rushed to the little bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t leave much time for the mage to think about it. All he can rely on is the experience and conditioning that this body has accumulated over the past 100 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s wonderful, he seems to be out of the bondage of the body, but still can feel all the nuances, he can deeply see the slightly open The mouth, admire the light gray tongue and the number of teeth, can smell the squid and octopus, find a broad leaf algae on the black front fin, he can feel his body is along The line that the killer whale pounced backwards. He lifted his arm and ten fingers fell deeply into the thick fat of his upper abdomen. He breathed calmly - brought by nearly 10,000 pounds of weight. Under terrible pressure, it even tilted the entire boat to the left, and the left side of the ship did not enter the sea. He knew that he was pushing this behemoth, and by its leaping force, it avoided the most important mains and sails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
