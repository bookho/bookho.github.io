			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the "scaled pen" is called a scale pen is that it is a reason - don't look at the pub owner now standing behind the high platform, and the casks behind him are just like It was a bunch of twin brothers, but when he was young, he was a slender, sensitive and handsome man like an elf. Of course, the American son is the gimmick that he added to himself. Just as he always claimed to be a prince, he just escaped the kingdom because he hated the savage and conspiracy in the court. He was anonymous in the country and the city. The bard wandered around—people heard him say this and they laughed loudly. Sometimes they would lift him to the table, put a plate on his head, and yell at him, calling him a king of rice. Or the Duke of Cider - and the owner of the pub is always smiling, not angry at all because of their contempt or ridicule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone also curiously asked the wife of the tavern owner, but she knew nothing about her husband’s thirty-five years ago, when he saw her In addition to a wet clothes, boots and an old Soltli, nothing else, but she fell in love with him at once, they escaped from the girl's father's eyes, and then, in this small When staying in the city, the owner of the pub got the eye of the consul with a song that he listened to and listened to. He was allowed to live here and they lived. The bard's wife made a good stew, and the bard borrowed dozens of silver coins with his dexterous tongue. This hard-working bird built his own nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that his wife’s stew is too delicious. Three meals a day are made with butter, whale oil, or lard potatoes. The result of mead and rice is that the bard swells like a magical spell. His wife said, "Oh, you don't really look like a bard." And he said: “But it’s like a pub owner.” So they took out all the savings, expanded their home, and turned it into a pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the bard is still willing to commemorate his past, so he decided to hang a bright and huge metal scale under the signboard of the pub, it The top of it is engraved with the dent of a feather pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the pub owner is not a shallow-looking guy who has never even seen an elf, but he must say it from the heart, this The devils who made him this rude pub were more approachable than the ones he had encountered before. In any case, no elf would ask his wife carefully. What kind of oil is used in the stew, what kind of spices are used, or potatoes or onions, celery, etc... One of them also tasted it personally and directed a Fan, you know, in the kitchen, his wife is the queen. If there is no reason, she will never listen, but this time... she is listening very seriously. The owner of the pub refused to think about it because it was standing beside her, and the whisper was a perfect person who came out of the fantasy of a girl. Of course, even if he is now three times as big as the past, he Still his wife's favorite person, and the most beautiful opposite sex in her eyes - she listened so carefully, just because the other person said it really makes sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has directed human females to carefully strip the black film in the body cavity of the fish. This kind of film grows in the body of the fish, perhaps because of laziness, or because of ignorance, humans will hardly remove it when dealing with them, but such fish are cooked in soup or baked on fire. It will be bitter and suffocating, so these scaled creatures that grow in the lakes and rivers will only try hard when there is nothing to eat - but if it is handled properly, put ginger and shallots, it The beauty of the sea is unmatched by the fish in the sea. It is a subtle and gentle taste, like the one who tells the elves how to deal with river fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the pub is busy, she barely dares to look up to see the elves around her. To be honest, she feels that standing next to him is like a kind of Oh, and the clean kitchen she has cleaned up is a kind of smudge to him, but when he insists, probably no one can violate his will - she put the processed fish in Fry in the pot, wait until the two sides are browned, then pour in the boiling water and put in the spices (the ginger and the shallots are spices for them), and before that, she smells the strong fragrance that comes any time than ever before - Even standing in the kitchen, she could hear someone in the pub asking what was being done in a loud voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the contents of the pot were changed from a broth covered with a thin layer of fat to a white soup like milk, she carefully put the salt. After picking up the spoon from the soup, she habitually tasted it - the wife and mother's eyes slammed wide. She cooked countless big fish, mostly from the beach, but some came from the river, but She was the first to taste such a delicious soup, although it took a whole amount of time she could feed a table, but it was worth it. The human female shook her head involuntarily, and it was a sigh and a surprise. People said that the elves did not touch anything except flowers and fruits. How did they know how to make such a delicious fish soup? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wife of the pub owner squeezed the skirt in distress. She didn't know what to say. Sorry, or thank you. Finally, she hesitated and asked: "...So... what more do you need? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me some fermented cakes," Kerry said kindly: "It's baked in the stove like bread, but flat, The top is sprinkled with scallions and sesame seeds. It is best to have a little meat inside." He is not very clear about this, but in the gray gaze vigil, Kreima once described this to him and expressed A strong desire - he described the juice made with beans, and the long-haired tofu - the tofu is still eaten by Kerry Ben in the Alva Master, the food comes from Serris, very Dry, with tenacity, light and tasteless, and a little bit suffocating, but it is a pure plant, but the elf does not know that it will grow hair, is this a strange existence that can be transformed between plants and animals? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the soup of fish and meat can still be done, their dinner is this, only Lucie and Aloha who are the Eya spirits. No, their dinner is a bunch of rakes and a few figs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afra, as soon as she saw Lucie, knew where she had all the bad feelings about this strange female elf - she obviously also had a passionate love for her guardian. Italian, although Afra has never heard of Lucie’s name or related description in Kremar’s mouth, she also knows that another soul in the black-haired dragon’s body is soft and tolerant. A good person, he is not accustomed to rejecting any kind hospitality, and stupidly will find ways to return more. Of course, in addition to Afra's dedication, hey, he is simply avoiding it. Afula knows why, although the soul she loves is not willing to say anything, but the former undead can not have such kindness - but that is really ridiculous, Afra’s father is Gülen, a The thief, and he is the person Afra is loved by the soul, she never thought about becoming his daughter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a barrier between them, but is it not ridiculous to say that a pair of people with long lives like a dragon? Sixty and sixteen years old sounds amazing to the mortal, but is there any gap between the ages of 560 and 516? The mortal reputation, law, and morality are as insignificant to them as a vain light. Sometimes Afra is hard to understand what the adult is thinking about - why is he always so worried? They have a strong power, do they have to give up the happiness at their fingertips in order to succumb to the thoughts and sights of the weak? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But perhaps because of this, he will reach out to the young, humble, plain-looking child... Afula closes her eyes and she chews The name of Krimal, the name of the name in the dragon language is not good, but the person with the name has to break the chain of the curse, flying to the sky, but those who once despised him, humiliated him With the abuse of him, the person who wants to kill him falls into the dirty mud, and it is difficult to extricate himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the room was sizzled at this time, and Afra’s heart passed a little dissatisfaction, but she was very good at hiding her emotions in calm. Under the face, she glanced at her cohabitation and found that she was watching herself nervously. The thief’s daughter smiled and walked to the door. She was clearly identified with a layer of wood. A familiar smell - this soup often appears on the table when there is a chance to dine with Cremal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afra is almost inviting to pull the door inward, but to her disappointment is that standing outside the door, the fish soup is the owner of the pub Wife, not the one she expects to see. But in the meantime, she was happy again, and she did not want him to see Lucio too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish soup and fermented bread with meat on the small table in the room, in order to avoid trouble, the elves did not go down to eat, and decided to I stayed here for one night and waited until dawn to leave. There were not many rooms in the pub. Ruiwen, Lucie, and Afula as the only three women were arranged in a room, but because of the temporary situation of Ruiwen Leaving the relationship, there is only the little girl left in the room (at least it seems). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afra is not so happy when he sits down, Lucy seems to be a bit childish, but some of her places But it wasn't the case. Aphra looked at the raised position unobtrusively, considering whether he should add something like papaya to his meal—the Surreys said this. Maybe the Jade Forest Island is full of papayas, maybe it can't explain why these elves can grow like this without even broth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
