			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Til’s brilliance illuminates the orc’s ugly face, and the Baldwin’s knights form a loose arrow shape that protects their companions from side to side. Behind them, they are exceptionally powerful and sensitive, but the Thunder have to face thousands of orcs. The knights can only temporarily disperse them and force them to escape and destroy their formation. , disturbing their sight... Bywin is the only person who is focused on moving forward, his goal is so clear - the warriors of the orcs jumped from the triangular shed that guarded the siege, waving their own Hammer and axe, Birdwin shouted Tyre's name, fearlessly greeted the enemy with ten times his number. He cast a spear and nailed an orc to the siege hammer. On the wooden platform axle, then he pulled out the wide sword and cut off the shoulder of an orc warrior obliquely from his collarbone to his ribs; an orc attempted to hit the knee of his mount, the horse stood up angrily, huge Nailed with black iron horseshoe The horseshoe knocked a bloody vague moon mark on his ugly face. Baldwin’s body tilted in midair, and he swung his wide sword without panic, one of the orcs who wanted to poke him from behind. The orc took a dart with a wooden handle, and the dart apparently came from the orc's blacksmith's hand. The impurities inside were not completely removed. It was folded in Baldwin's armor; it caused a real threat to Birdwin. It is a strong orc with a lantern shield and a short sword. The so-called lantern shield is an expensive, large iron shield that covers a well, connected with a pair of iron gloves, and the gaps of the gloves are inlaid. The iron thorn, and the center of the shield also has a sharp bulge like a dagger. Some of its edges have been intentionally polished, like the cold edge of the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc who clung to this terrible armor stood in the melting snow almost as high as the Bedwin sitting on the horse, filthy and brutal red Brown eyes and cold, firm gray eyes look at each other - the orcs only have tribes, princes and priests, no nobles and knights, they have only great warriors, warriors and ordinary orcs, orc slaves, half-orcs, human slaves - - The orc, which is opposite to Birdwin, has a solid, anti-corrosive human eye necklace hanging around his neck. There are also two elf ears in between. In the orc tribe, the elf ear is the privilege of the priest - he is likely to be The priest's son, only or the greatest, his father hung these two blessed sacrifices on his neck, praying for the praise and grace of the orc god, which is better than steel armor. Dragon skin boots and Mithril wristbands are more proof of his identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jumped to one side, more light and silent than a vicious wolf, then waved the huge shield against Baldwin’s left rib, the owner of Thunder Castle Raising his arm in time, the shield's blue-gray surface and his armor made a loud collision and harsh friction, and the acupuncture on the front of the shield forced Bedwin to tilt to the right - the orc's power surpassed Byrd. Wen’s expectation, just a little, he was hit down – amazing pressure from his arm to his waist, and from the human waist to the horse, because of the white marks between the two eyes The dexterous horse, named the meteor, also suffers from Tyre's shade. It is stronger and smarter than its kind, but this time it also swayed its head irritably - and the right side of the horse and the horse's owner, the rear With the front, only the enemy has no friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs around them want to attack the legs of the "meteor", but the gorgeous robes cover the position of the horse's legs well, and as a horse that has undergone countless training and battle tests, "Meteor" is also good at avoiding swords. The stab, even if it can't be seen, the sword darts can only cut the tassels of the horses at most - so they shoot arrows to the "meteor", most of the arrows are boney, but some are black iron, one The arrow of the iron arrow shot into the only part of the loyal horse that had never been covered with armor, that is, the small piece near the tail, the arrow was quenched with sour vinegar, and the "meteor" shook with pain, it almost used With all the strength, you can firmly hold your own four iron hooves on the frozen soil that has been made of blood and snow, and maintain balance and stability when greater pressure comes, just like in Four steel columns were inserted into the frozen soil—Bedwin violently turned his body, removed the shield's oppression, and changed his hands to hold the wide sword. He waved a violent sword laterally, and the orc reluctantly retreated. Zhang Dakou Fort Ting owner threatened to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin swiftly glanced around, the situation was not so good for humans, the bodies of the orcs were accumulating, but their numbers were like There is no end, the power of the knight is limited - he made a decision that made everyone stunned. When another sword meets, he jumps off and gives up the help and embarrassment of "Meteor". He directly faces this with him. Two times as tall as the orc, he is fearless, and his wide sword smothers a colorless flame like a substantial anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human warrior and the orc warrior simultaneously issued a dull roar, like a lightning strike, short sword, shield and wide sword as if in that short one There have been numerous collisions in an instant, and Mars is jumping around in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin’s decision is correct. The orc warrior’s taller body than the ordinary orc is a disadvantage when faced with too small enemies. Should be like the other big orcs, like a beast, with his claws and teeth against humans, but he is not willing to give up precious shields, he can be awkwardly chasing Baldwin, trying to squeeze the human leader He died under the huge steel armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave Birdwin the chance to kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs are so loud and frustrated to retreat, if they have more courage, they may be able to keep Birdwin in battle. But no orc is willing to die first - Birdwin turned over and almost unimpededly came to the front of the triangular shed that covered the siege hammer. He shouted the name of Tyre and waved his wide sword three times. The board that wrapped the wet skin was opened, and the chain that hangs the siege hammer was crushed for the second time. The third hammer broke the siege hammer, and the iron sheep head fell into the sludge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc warriors shouted angrily, instead of whip sticks, but used swords to drive the orc soldiers forward, but the dense arrows from human picks and archers blocked their pursuits - an orc warrior The place where they were only three horses was penetrated by a short spear shot from a rifle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin and his knights rushed into Thunderbolt, their shackles ran up, and the knights had exhausted their last strength, they were simply When they fell from the horses, they removed their armor from the light road, took off the chain armor, and untied the tight robes. The priest in charge of the treatment - not the bright Rosada's service, the benevolent Ilmot's service, one-on-one cast their healing spells, warm white light glaring at the knight's body and mind, Devin counted them with his eyes, and every name that couldn't correspond to a fresh face would make him heartbroken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is Kerry Ben?" He asked, that is one of his most trusted knights. When he went out of town, this steady young man Instead of commanding soldiers and knights to continue their battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The elves have succeeded." The knight said with excitement: "They burned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mage around Kerry’s side took the lead in casting a spell, which brought a large group of elusive but full of stench and fog, operating the trebuchet The orcs who protected it bent down one after another to start vomiting, except for the priests who were obviously different from the ordinary orcs. The latter survived not because they were stronger, but because they were hanging in their necks. The priest-given talisman - they soon discovered the existence of the elves and arched them, but the elves' arrows were faster than them, and the arrows of the elves were enchanted, the silver arrow, and the steel The chain armor is like a steel arrow arrow piercing the leather armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry's arrow is aimed at an orc priest who is older than other priests, with strange black spots on his blue-gray skin. The elf's eyesight can see how they squirm and bulge—he is the priest of the Blizzard tribe, Denver, who has captured Kerry's friends and tortured him ten whites and nine nights, Kerryburn. Unable to save his friend, he cut off the right hand of the old priest. Now the position of this hand is occupied by a black claw. It stretches out into the sky like a dead tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrow shot through the neck of the priest, but as a phantom did not produce a star and a half damage, Kerry knew that maybe somewhere, an innocent human slave or ordinary orc, half-orc was suddenly appearing because of the neck The fatal wound is terrified - one of the orcs' common priests, using other people's lives to ensure their own safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denver raised a finger to Kerry, his fingers, translucent white nails bent and pointed - a chilly The wind passed through the body of the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kreima immediately cast his spell, a hot and beautiful flame. The flame hit the base of a sling, but it did not completely ignite the entire trebuchet as the elves and humans wanted. It burned quietly for a while, and it was silently extinguished because of the lack of magic. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Water?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spell." Kerry Ben said: "Follow me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc soldiers climbed up, while the elves swooped down, the wizard wizards cast spells, and the warriors pulled out the scimitar after shooting the empty quiver Short swords, but they are not fighting these ordinary orcs, or they must spend less time and power in more correct places - the orcs of the orcs and their chiefs - They flew over the heads of orc soldiers like birds, or stepped on their heads like a stone in a stream of water across a foul and noisy battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the orc priests have been singing and singing, rhythmically waving bronze bells, splashing blood and wine... the leader of the tribe or their recognized warrior station In front of the priests, the priests will summon the waiters who come to Kawu, and borrow magic from them so that they can gain unprecedented courage and wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't let them complete the summoning." Kerry Ben said that he first rushed to a priest, the elf's scimitar flashed, and the priest rushed Rolled to the ground - he regained his life, but the call was interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar cast a greasy spell on a priest, and he slipped with his warrior, and the thin priest was crushed by the mighty warrior. Underneath the body, waving cognac hands and feet in vain - the orcs desperately want to get up from the priests who are respected by their identities, but they squatted on the poor little body again and again, but unfortunately he was finally taken by another The Warriors grabbed their feet and dragged them away, otherwise he might have helped the Elf a big favor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
