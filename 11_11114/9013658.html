"With them, we can do a lot of things, adults," she looked at Byrdwin. "So much... even if it is enough to make a sin to the new king of Norman in the Highlands."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My sin is not for the new king of Norman in the Highlands to be forgiven." Birdwin said in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...we always have a place to get it, this is gold!" Meimi eagerly saw everyone, she wanted to find her supporters But no one gave a response, even the thief just glanced at the mushroom that was picked up in his hand, and the gloved hand smashed it, "Glan," she prayed: "You There are ways to replace them with gold, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Gülen said, and then before Meimi’s smile has not disappeared, it’s bad but not lost. Honestly replied: "But that is very dangerous. Most people who dare to buy the devil's fingers are not so good, and no one will feel more gold." If he is still his branch leader in the Thieves Guild, he does not. Dare to put so many devil fingers into the private pocket - the best result is that he can raise the first step, or get a generous bounty - only such as "silver finger" (that is, the guild of Gülen) ), the "sinister" thief guild can only eat such a large portion of the accidental wealth, other Even got to know only one death only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Few things are not good?" Mei Mi asked not to be willing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said Kerry Ben, the thief wisely closed his mouth - in fact, if it wasn’t for the elf, he would want to take it. Going a little, if only a little bit, he can lie that he had stolen a pocket with a caster from a wizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you have decided this way," Fro's pastor resentfully twisted his finger: "Why then let us know? You can Quietly bringing the Master here, we don’t know anything, and of course we won’t feel sad.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Most of the tip of the poison grows deep in the forest In the swamp," Kerry said: "But because it requires a lot of corrupted flesh and nourishment. They are not so easy to survive. You can see fierce beasts or monsters, like food. Rotten, creepy, tree-lined demon or swamp crocodile, sometimes found in the territory of Mori, but I saw it. The biggest of them is just a palm, the tip of a place. It’s often less than a pound to get together...” He looked at Fro’s pastor and apparently hoped she could understand what he meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I already know how precious it is." Mei Mi said impatiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan shook his head, and Pastor Fro was confused by gold. She even forgot the camouflage and fear she deserved: "This mushroom is not natural." Formed." He explained on his behalf: "Someone is breeding them - those deformed monsters are their gardeners and guards, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They choose here It’s because the people in this village originally had a lot of goats and sheep,” said Leona. “They can drive the flock out and give it to a businessman who doesn’t exist, as long as their coins are still jingling. No one will notice any suspiciousness in the sound, and even the pastor in the village has not noticed—in fact, those sheep have become the basis for cultivating the fingers of the devil.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They should find a remote place to do this," Leona said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That will cause the attention of the white robe and the knights," Birdwin said. "Who will pay attention to a small village like this, if not Suddenly a group of goblins came," Birdwin added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The village chief hired us again." The thief said: "So they intentionally fell, so that at least they can drive us away. Lest we discover something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suspect that the priest died because of this," said the Ranger: "not because of the goblin or accident that the villagers thought."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like us." Mei Mi said gloomyly that she had already got the answer. The Ranger can certainly tell no one, only two people with the Master will destroy this devil's fingers, but they will be ignorant of this and they will be subjected to fierce revenge without any precautions. Obviously Kerry is still Not ready to plunge his teammates to such a miserable situation, although it is not bad now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that Fro’s pastor is more and more trying to take some devil’s fingers, she can’t just take risks but she can’t get any benefit. It’s not fair. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have to go away first, are you?" Gülen asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you burn, you have to go to the ground." Kerry Ben said, "The devil's fingers will produce harmful smoke when burning, and its name is The sound is also very difficult to hear - but now boys can come to help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not easy to deal with such a large piece of devil's fingers. They have to dig them out one by one. So that the hyphae remaining in the moist soil will grow a new tip, and the ash after the poison tip is infiltrated into the soil layer and then into the groundwater. Don't forget that this kind of thing is a poison to the human mouth. Even if it is burned, its effectiveness will be reduced, but the amazing amount may make it work the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the mage cut off the smoke and sound and burned them out, the cautious Elf Ranger on this thing was in the dark crypt Repeated inspections three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really don't know why Kerry has hated this kind of thing." The thief said: "He behaves like he wants to use it as an elf child. Playground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elves have always hated this." Kremar said: "I met him for the first time and he was chasing a carry. The mercenary of the devil's finger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have he told you about this, about this?" Gülen asked inadvertently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," the black-eyed caster glanced at him: "This is not a good thing, we know this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German bowed to him to show his warning, but this is the thief’s instinct and habit, and no one knows how big a small secret will be. Value, it may be worth your life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were near dusk when they returned to the village, and the aroma from the chimney kept the plums licking their stomachs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village chief in the village has fallen ill since he knows that his daughter and son have become a delicious meal of the morph, but in order to express their gratitude He struggled to live with his brother and left his house to the adventurers, but it was also possible that he didn't want to see this room that would remind him of Abby and her brother – the villagers simply cleaned it. A bit - the previous deformation blame made the room messy, replaced them with new straw, and the stove was also lit with a bright flame. The iron pan on the hearth was cooking a whole leg of lamb. And one is placed in a jar. Salted meated lamb belly. It’s not that the villagers have become generous at once. These are the sheep that have been seriously injured and have not recovered, and will die at any time. In this case, it is better to kill it as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They used three plates and three wooden spoons to take a meal in a hurry and satisfactorily. The villagers left a bucket of water in the corner and they drank a little. After simply washing with the remaining water, I fell down and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei waking up near dawn, she felt screaming on her neck and back when she got up from the straw, Fro’s pastor was in the house In the twilight of the hearth, I took two steps carefully and pushed the door out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guran opened his eyes a little, and it’s safe for the time being. The devil’s fingers have been burnt, and even their ashes are The caster hid himself in his pocket, and he was not worried that Plum could find one or two of them - even if the devil's fingers were both evil and terrible, it was a plant after all, and it was impossible to escape as long as it was a plant. Have the eyes of the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro's pastor left the warm house. The cold air and the breeze made her spirit alive – she walked to the edge of the village and stopped – a black furry long-winged black hamster gently landed on her shoulder near the neck. The sharp tongue licked her skin, and there was a large artery underneath the thin skin. The little devil could hear how the hot blood flowed inside. "Go ahead, dear," it sweet. Saying, I wonder if it would be a comfort to tear her neck apart and suck it up: "I have prepared a small gift for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young human female smiled, she didn't think that this little monster who lost her master could get something worth seeing, in her cognition. The little devil is just a pet that is smarter than a cat or dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's here," said the little devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei only saw a puffed rose, with white and pink flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil Asmodeos jumped from her shoulder and stood on top of a large thorn rose flower, ripped open and hung on it Small bag on the neck. This bag is so small that even if the drawstring is pulled open, the bag mouth is only allowed to put a thumb of plum, but it can actually fall back a pound of things - the first plum I couldn't recognize what the black and red wrinkled pieces were, but a glimmer of light suddenly swept past her mind, and she immediately raised her hand and held her mouth to avoid unconscious cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want these?" The little devil pretended to be ignorant and said: "I found these in a box."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei put down his knees .跪 There was a branch of the devil's fingers that had apparently been dried. Although the light was dim, she could still find the features that belonged to the devil's fingers. After all, she had watched it for a long time before being forced out of the crypt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, yes," she said ecstatically: "This is it," she put all the devil's fingers into her robes. While catching the little devil, he kissed it evilly: "How did you get it... Is there still in that box?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing. "The little devil wiped the place where the spouse of Pastor Fro was smothered with a tail: "Only these, I have been looking for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃... ...It doesn't matter." Mei Mi has some regrets, but in any case, it is better than nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I have to thank you." She stood up with satisfaction and said, "What do you want? Berries, honey or dried meat?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can feed myself." Better food than berries and dried meat, the little devil said in his heart: "Can I be with you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a caster among you." The little devil said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar." Mei honey touched her nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s him," said the little devil. "You know that I am a little monster," he said in a sincere and gentle voice: "I was in that plague." I lost my master, and the little monster as a magical creature can't live without the master—I want him to be my new owner, but he refuses.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Ah... that's okay - it's too unfortunate." Mei Mei said in a hurry, she almost said her true words, Fro is on, if the caster is willing to accept this little monster as Pets, then today the bag of devil fingers probably won’t fall in her hands, Mei Misi snarls, and he will only take it to the genius Kerry Ben, and then violently burn the heavenly things: “It’s strange why he doesn’t Willing," Fro's pastor said half-truthfully: "You are so cute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
