Even with his knees, Lan can smell the thick scent of mysterious scorpion, the smell of myrrh and musk, and the sound of gimmicks fighting each other. The little hands that should be dexterous are even more stunned. When considering whether to sneak away, the gargoyle's claws can be said to have penetrated the sacred cabinet that obscures them without warning. It is like a distance of about six feet. The decaying wooden board is in front of this monster. No more reliable than a thin vellum, Gülen could even feel the chill of the metal's claws as he passed over his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan felt that he had never been so calm. When the stone statue stood in front of them, the shadow cast by it could even block Gülen and McGee, and the tip of the wing that it raised can only be rubbed into the beam by a raised finger. The thief does not know how much its wisdom has reached, but it obviously has an evil brain. It's very clear that its prey has nowhere to go. It opens its mouth like it is laughing or taunting, and threateningly opening its wings. It is clearly a hard stone carved wings but like a real leather wing. So soft, they are slightly in the air, they are two-way close to humans and gnomes, just like to give them a warm embrace, but look at the steel hook at the top of the wing, this hug can make people feel fleshy . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what Gülen did was to reach out and he was half behind the gnome, and now his arm is coming out of the gnome’s shoulder. The thumb and forefinger of the left hand hold the machine, it can be said that all the strength is forced to press down. In the screaming hysterical scream, the thief still hears the snoring that makes him feel happy, without the thief. The sound was strange, and then, almost at the same time, his right hand pulled the trigger, and the little sling shot and slammed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome screamed and fell forward, and Gülen also picked up the cloak, covered his body and face and slammed down, so who they I didn’t see where the bursting arrow hits, but Gülen didn’t think that his prospects would be lost in this critical moment. The wife of fate didn’t make their jokes again. The stone wings of the gargoyles suddenly collapsed. The smashing arrow has already shot its chest, and the violent explosion smashed it together with the core. Its hunting behavior has created the spurs and thieves to be shielded by the barriers of the explosion and the airborne waves like a dagger. The stone fragments, steel teeth, etc. are blocked by the two arc-shaped slabs, causing only minimal damage to the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should really appreciate its wisdom." The thieves shook their heads. If there were no previous threatening moves, at least they would have to lose a gnome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, the gods are on, the gods are on," the gnome cried, saying that he had a big bag on his head, but In this case, he must admit that he is really lucky. "Get up!" Gülen yelled at him: "The door is ruined!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes It seems that fate is still an uncompromising daughter-in-law. A piece of stone that has splashed out hits the hinge at the top of the door and let it fall off. The door that has been crumbling under the claws and impact of the zombie is now only The hinges that remain in the middle and the lowest section are still loyal, the doors are skewed, and the zombies are rushing out of the gap to reach out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McGee immediately climbed up, Gülen never looked at the gnomes, they were simply a group of meat-eating rabbits, but even he had to admire the gnomes to run away The wisdom and decisiveness of the full play must be that he is still screaming and crying, but can accurately bypass any tiny obstacles, and he did not want to talk to the zombies, he jumped up. Grabbed Gülen's hand and ran straight to the gap that was knocked out by the gargoyle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is coming in from the gap, there is no rain tonight, there is no low-pressure cloud, the stars are bright, they can see the under the main tower as soon as they bow their heads The ridiculous grasses need to be mentioned here. Since they are distinguished guests, the hostess here originally wanted them to live in the highest top floor room, but they were rejected by the elves. They are now on the fourth floor of the main tower. On the third floor, the caster and the elf are on the fourth floor, Leona, Birdwin, and their third floor, three-story tower and about six feet high, so that they are more than two Fifteen feet, this height is certainly no problem for Gülen, but for the gnomes, there are some fears and fears why he remembers bringing thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan is not okay about this, he mentions the gnome, he can afford it for about a few tens of pounds, but he is standing at the gap, the other When I grabbed the edge of the intertwined stone bricks, I stopped all the movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glan?!" The gnome shouted, giving him a soundtrack of zombies’ grotesque squeaks and tears, gnomes hanging from Gülen’s arm On the other hand, I turned my head and looked at it: "Oh, damn it," he yelled. "They came in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it’s a little bit of wisdom, or a little prank that was given by a cursed god. Anyway, a zombie was torn apart half a shoulder while being squeezed by a companion, and suddenly it was a small piece. Just crawling into the room, although a shoulder is missing, even with an arm is not so strong, but swaying, hanging with a bone, but he also has a strong body, an arm and two legs And a bite that doesn’t look like a savvy steel tooth, but it’s not the most chilling thing. “He is...” The gnome shouted, “He is that person...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief has also been identified, given that he has had the same experience as a thief and has been bundled into a scorpion by the thin silver rope of the black haircaster. Lanke didn't forget the ridiculous look on his correct face, but this person should be kept in jail instead of becoming a zombie everywhere: "What about that," he said to McGee, are you? Still ready to say hello to him? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome certainly doesn't want to, but the sad knight seems to think very much, his back is severely curved, and the upper body is like a long-armed monkey. The arm can always hang down to the ground, and his knees make his legs tightly folded, like a squatting squat, and the next moment he jumps up like a cockroach and slams into the station. On the edge of the collapsed outer wall, there are two strangers who seem to have no retreat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan did not hesitate to jump.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McKe’s face touched the broken stone, his forehead was bloody, and if his little hand blocked his eyes in time, his eyes would suffer and then a series of Heavy collision, he didn't know what Gülen was doing. They didn't seem to be caught by the zombies, but they didn't seem to be on the ground. To be precise, he seemed to be hung in the air. He Carefully remove your hand and glance at it. Look, the gnome is always right. He is indeed hung in the air. His underwear is silk. It can be said to be wide and soft. Now Gülen hangs its collar on a sharp bulge, and McGee is like a living vent statue that becomes a wonderful decoration for the icy façade.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where is Gülen? He is not safe. The thieves are fighting with zombies. His fine gold dagger is deeply inserted into the hard wall. The hand guard is like a viper. Usually swimming with one hand, so that he can safely hang in the air, compared to the death of the knight leader is not so happy, it originally lacked a usable arm, if not it The feet also have curved claws, so now it can only be stupidly hung on the wall and can't do anything. Now, it can stand on the outer wall with bare feet and bear the black hair. The caster cares, and Glan's clothes are also from the silver-crowned jungle. Otherwise, he may have been bitten by the zombie's claws or teeth and become a fresh, dry nightingale, but he Obviously, I can’t take the zombie. . & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp comp <br <br /> & nbsp />;"McKe!" he shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mckey lost a stone down, but did not knock the zombie but gave Gülen a look, the thief turned a blank eye, he really should not pin his hopes In a gnome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved Gülen’s embarrassing situation is a slender arrow, the arrow is from the left ear of the zombie, the arrow from the position of the skull I wore it out and only got it. The zombie fell down. After the dull slamming, it was shredded and almost inaudible. The gnome hangs his head and looks down. He now knows. Why did Gülen not jump with him? Below is a group of mice with red eyes. No one tasted zombies, but everyone knows that zombies are as tough as the best leather, but these mice It took less than a quarter of an hour to bite it and swallow it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is very short, but enough for Gülen to bring McGee to a safe and secure city with the help of the elf Druid Perant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city has become a solitary pedestal because of the age of the castle, but the height is still around ten feet, and the rats surround them, rubbing The sound of the teeth is clearly identifiable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great," McGee said to Perant: "You are a druid, my dear friend, you can become a cat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The minimum is only a big cat." Gülen said sarcastically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't become a cat," Perant said calmly. "These mice have been infected. They are no longer normal animals. If I change Adult cats, whether they are bitten by them or bite them, will be infected as well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what should we do now?" Gülen said: "Or become a snake, or an elephant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elephant is good," Perant said: "But not the best. The solution, "No one knows how he did it, and McGee and Gülen only felt a dark eye. Along with the louder sounds of the rats, they saw that the beetles like the tides poured out from the darkness out of thin air. They bite each other, pull them, and the small feet waved wildly, forming a thick moment in an instant. Walls, blocking the rats and them, McGee put his fists in his mouth, but still can't control himself to vomit. There are also bugs on the Dragonfire Island, but no matter which one is not as big as he sees now, then There are many, and Gülen can't help but look pale. He has seen this kind of bug. In the main city of the guild, a thief was tortured because he sold the leader. Finally, he was put into such a wormhole. These beetles are carnivores. They don't have sharp teeth, but they have hollow hollow straws that are as hard as metal. You can puncture the bone directly, sucking the bone inside, they don't bite the outer skin, it's too slow for them, they will get into any hole like eyes, nose, ears or other places Crawl between the internal organs, pull out the muscles and reach the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
