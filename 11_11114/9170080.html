			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it possible to shake the foundation of the city wall?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's hard," said a warlock. He is not a Grenada, because he has one of the four gnomes, his height is unusual, but another quarter of the devil's blood makes him unable to become a powerful caster, but he can mix the gnomes. After the talent, he was particularly sensitive to structure or mechanics: "The foundation of the wall is the rock formation. At the beginning, the priests of the dwarves should summon the earth elements. Their bodies are about forty feet or five after curing. The depth of ten feet - you should be able to see," he said, after all, the earth elements summoned by the priests of the Great, and a camp between Grenada and the Longshan state. It. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are moats. After the earth elemental creatures collapse, their bodies are crushed in the ground and rivers, and the rushing water constantly pushes the loose gravel soil. It may take only one day, or two days, that the wreckage of the earth elemental creatures will not leave too much, at least not to pose any threat to the people of the Longshan state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So can the priests summon more earth elements?" said another warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This requires the temple to ask." The companions around him said, so all the warlocks were quiet, and the temple they said was of course the young red dragon. Except for the Red Dragon, no one in the Legion can order these unruly women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the faintly headed among them patted the palm of their hand: "Let's try it and see if we can bring it to our enemies." Some cute little gifts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't have much time," a mage reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The speed at which they spread will surprise you," said the chief of the warlocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I think I must thank the lady’s reminder. "Almost at the same time, in another tent, the dark-haired dragon said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That may be the most dangerous enemy you have to face." Mullen said that he came from his lover and the mentor’s orders. After all, they are working for the Highness, though, if Cremari is unfortunately lost his life or earlier in the internal battle, as a disciple of the Lich and disciple of the disciple, they will not be too Strict treatment, but if you can, Ms. Gray is not prepared to change the owner so quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would not be my most dangerous enemy, the lich thinks, my most dangerous enemy is not in the king of Grenada or in seventy-seven Islands. The message brought by Mullen can't help him any more. He is not stupid enough to be ignorant of the red dragon's maliciousness, and the red dragon's pawn is one of his chips. Of course, he will not do these things. And Mullen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to express my gratitude," the dark-haired dragon said: "Please tell the lady in gray robes around her, her colleague is plundering her. Opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merren waited for a while before he understood that the prince would not explain everything to the extent of the details. However, as long as a small reminder, Ms. Gray Robe can search and explore on her own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he thought, Ms. Gray robe did not ask too much, she left the tent after thinking for a little while, about to boil in Mullen After a pot of celesian tea, she reappeared beside him, and the pale face of the deceased also had a meager blood color, and it looked quite proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't want to ask me?" Mullen's mentor asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I can know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can certainly know," said Ms. Gray Robe While leaning lightly into Mullen's arms, the gesture is no different from an ordinary girl: "Things are over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
