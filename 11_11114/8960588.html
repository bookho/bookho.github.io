			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dylan..." Birdwin said in a complicated way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Dylan, in the eyes of some unknown people, is a brother who has half the same blood. Birdwin knows that he is not Morton. Tang Klei’s son, he was just an ordinary civilian. He remembered that his father had slipped off the cliff while hunting a fox, and his mother, a mediocre woman, died of dystocia. At that time, he did not have a triangular bow to get Gao Bodwin to grow up in a difficult and lonely way. If his father had not taught him how to hunt before his death, and the old lord of Morton was kind and allowed to allow his people to He entered the forest and field hunting in the two months of the year, and he died long ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before being noticed by Morton Donkley, Birdwin did not even have a name. People called him a black arrow. The black arrow is the name of a local eagle. The back and wings are black. When it folds its wings, it dives down like a roaring arrow and a human being is called this name because his arrows are like this one. The small, but strong and agile bird is in danger of being in a hurry. Every time there will be a failure, Morton will call him. When he sees him, he is gray but still sharp, and the powerful and powerful owner of Thunder Castle laughs happily. Up: "It's amazing," he said. "You have the gray and gray eyes of the Don Cree family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Tyre Knight from his seat Standing up, the weight and heat of his hands with the armor gloves on the shoulders of Birdwin still remember clearly, "Don't call it a black arrow again," Morton Don Clay said: "That is The name of a bird, I have a name that is more suitable for you, Birdwin It means the warrior on the battlefield. I believe that you will not be afraid of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said this and allowed Byrdwin, a parentless blood and property. The civilians became his envy. From there, Baldwin got enough food and gold coins to respect and envy, as well as formal training and teaching. After a few years he was replaced by Morton as a knight and then they spent ten harsh together like a real father and son. In the winter, during the period of Morton. Don Cray led him to the future king and many nobles, calling him his own heir, and praising him as the rumor of Morton Donkley's illegitimate child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baldwin was in the early spring and early spring morning. He first met Dylan Don Cray in the countryside outside the capital, a small, pale, only boy with bright eyes like emerald, a red-colored scroll. Surrounded by pointed chins. His mother, according to his shoulder, did not allow him to approach his nominal father, Moreton Don Cray, who also seemed to have never seen the son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning...Bedwin, my brother." This is the first sentence that Dylan Donkre and Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two time scenes and characters cleverly fit together, but they are all grown up, and are already in different positions, Dylan is still prominent, and Birdwin is already a sinful fugitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin doesn't know if he should plead with Dylan Don Cray, he is not afraid of death, but he has his friends around him. The problem is that he never understood his brother. He really regarded Dylan Donkley as his little brother, especially after knowing Dylan’s real life, he could not ignore Dylan Don Cray’s expectations of Morton. With admiration, but can not shirk Molton. Don Cray poured on him, the love and trust of an elderly person. It is even more impossible to persuade him to love a child who symbolizes his shame and sorrow. He is at a loss, and can only switch between the two as much as possible, trying to ease the tension between them. The result was that no one could please, Morton thunder, and Dylan cast a spell. Let him stay in a muddy raft full of locusts for a whole night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then Dylan completely gave up Morton Don Clay, and had to say that the coldness between them made Bathwin sigh, Even other people think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin once thought that if Dylan had a child in the future, and he was willing to let his child inherit the Thunder Castle, then it would be fine. However, he even imagined how he should lead the child. Just like the former Morton Don Clay led him, he would give him the honor and the territory of the old Morton sword. In any case, this child will crown. The family name of the Don Cree family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the good prospects are fading with the advice of Birdwin to the pharaoh, and the magic horse under his seat grinds his own The hoof, the hard stone smashes under its feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dylan..." Birdwin muttered, he didn't know what he should say, whether Dylan would take care of that vague and illusory. Emotions? After Morton’s death, their connection was never interrupted. Dylan was the son of Fukai. With the help of his biological father, he easily became the king of Norman and he must pay attention to it. He never stepped on it. Into the Thunderbolt step, but his majesty served in Thunderbolt, his caravan brought food salt and other indispensable goods to the people of Thunder, taking away the fur gold gems and pyroxene from the whistling plain Thunderbolt has become more prosperous with their help, and Birdwin sends Dylan greetings and gifts every year, and Dylan occasionally writes back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birdwin always believed that Dylan was his brother, although they had no relationship with their bloodlines, but they all had the same surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Dylan? What does he think? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to ask you one thing, Byrdwin," Dylan said, he said it was light, slow, but very clear, like Every syllable is deeply engraved on everyone's heart: "There is only one problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmly looks at Birdwin, what he calls "Brother", this man, once strong, so loyal, so his father's favor in the name, now he is dusty, full of scars, but his gray eyes are still so bright and firm, painful but full hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell me, did you deliberately kill Norman's Pharaoh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," Baldwin said, without hesitation: "I never deliberately killed Norman's Pharaoh." It was a conspiracy, he had to fall into the plot, and Baldwin said to himself, and to all People say that this is unquestionable. He is a follower of Tell, a person of justice and justice. He absolutely... will not violate his vows, it is just a conspiracy, a plot not related to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan nodded lightly, as if he had led no less than ten wizards to stop the fugitive’s way just to get the answer, he Slightly bowed to Birdwin, sideways to give way: "So, my brother," he said: "Please leave, take your answer," he said whisperly: "Tell's eyes Will watch you forever... His silver hammer will fall on the sinner, let go." He made a gesture, and the wizards retreated to both sides of the road: "I wish you all the best, Byrdwin.唐克雷.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan Donkley’s failure to return to Norman The new king is upset or angry. In fact, Birdwin is only a page for him to finally turn over, like his brother, Norman’s pharaoh, although Birdwin is still not dead. . But a knight who committed a felony sin will eventually be cast aside by everyone. As far as he knows, in the temple of Tyre, the balance of Birdwin Don Clay has already been overturned. In other words, he has been completely rejected by Tyre, a fallen paladin is indeed, and there is indeed a fall behind and re-cleaned the sin. Returned to the paladin in the arms of Tyre, but only one, and he used it for a full 50 years to do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new king does not think that Baldwin can do it. And even if he did it, how could he be against himself? The person who killed the Pharaoh is not someone else. It is Birdwin himself. Even if Tyre comes to the new king, he will not say this sentence without fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter," he said to his nephew, patted his head intimately: "I have given a reward, and those thieves and assassins." They can always catch Baldwin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stand on the double wall before the twelve towers, of course, now it is the eleventh wall, rich Kay’s tower has become a mess of masonry. After the magical thorns and spells have failed, it has broken into countless pieces like a broken bottle. Its spires pile up a small in the moat. On the island, Fukai’s soldiers pulled ropes outside the masonry to ban civilians from being close to slaves, because the masonry piled with valuable jewels of gold and silk, and his servants were working hard to remove the stones and retrieve them from the inside. A little master's property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The biggest one ran away." The new king regretted saying "Oh, be careful," he reminded the nephew near the waste tower: "It is still going down." "The stone is falling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to see this spell." Dylan smiled and said: "I have to admit that this is really a whimsy." "The towers that used to be a major threat have become the ones that took off their steps and surrounded the twelve towers of Wang Ting. They were all created first, and then the connected double walls were built. This made the idea of ​​that person reach as high as possible." Hundreds of feet of towers fell to the outer city, its weight and power made all the spells useless. At that time, several powerful spellcasters arrived, destroying the double walls and outer towers connecting the towers. The wall, then hung his head on the moat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A businessman who sells big goose reported the incident. He saw several people coming out of the smoke, the gravel ruining his goose cage and letting go. His goose, and almost hurt his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will rebuild this tower." New King said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time you have to add spells to avoid regeneration like a disaster," Dylan said. "The other towers are also."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This I have to hand you over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my wish," Dylan bowed to the new king. : "If you can..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" said the new king, he likes this beautiful appearance, noble bloody nephew, willing to meet his wish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I lead the Master to hunt down the sinner of the monarch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new Wang Ke really hesitated. He suspected that Dylan had resentment against Byrdwin, or that this poor child had been worried about the injustice of Morton Donkley, but he knew that Baldwin was not alone, he was around. There is a half-elf mage, an elf ranger, and a thief (Fro's pastor is ignored by him), and he is likely to escape to the silver-crowned jungle, the elves are not willing to talk to you, The guys who talk about tactics and talk about bloodlines, they are stubborn like the stones in the Starlight River. Since the heirs of the Silver Crown jungle saved Baldwin, they would not admit that Baldwin was a villain, and Birdwin might be affected by them. Asylum, he does not want Dylan to be an enemy of them. Whether Dylan has caused damage to the elf or the elf has caused damage to Dylan is not what he wants to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured, my king," Dylan said: "I don't want to get the life of Birdwin, even though I have this opportunity. I won't let it go, but I think this is a good opportunity. In order to integrate our mage, your mage group, they need to run in and train. What better way to hunt down a sinner? You can't throw them to Thunder Castle. Well, it’s too much to lose.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new king coughed a few times and took out his handkerchief from his arms and held his lips: "Good. Well...if you...have made a decision," he frowned, reluctantly said: "Besides my mage, other mages can be handed over to you but remember, Dylan, you are my nephew, An earl, an nobleman, compared to the life of Birdwin and the integration of the Masters, your safety is even more worrying, so that you will never put yourself in irreparable harm, I will Let you go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promise." Dylan said, micro Smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do we go next?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not go to the silver crown jungle." Birdwin said that his injury has been well taken care of, Kremar's therapeutic syrup is quite effective, relatively small wounds have healed, compare The big ones have stopped the blood, but his arms are hard to come back. Birdwin doesn't care. He even joked that he can ask the dwarf to build a hammer and install it on the broken arm so he can do it. Blacksmith with his own tools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
