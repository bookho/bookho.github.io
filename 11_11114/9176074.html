			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highland Norman’s Sir Alex called the fetus a curse of the devil, and after Graham repeatedly thought about it, he still delivered the information. If Leona has only one of him, then there are many ways the thief can play, but she still has a baroness, the woman can not let go of the competitor’s mistakes, no matter whether the starting point of Gülen is good or bad, she will let The king’s trust in him has been shaken. Is Gülen the kind of idiot? of course not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang Li Naina put the parchment on the candle, her room is warm and humid, and the parchment takes a while to send out The stench that made her sick, but she didn't want the maid to handle this. She didn't want to let Birdwin know that he was full of expectations for the child. When she knew she was pregnant, he was literally So high jumped up, the former Thunderbolt lord constantly calculated the child's date of birth, and swearing under Liona's knees to make their children born in the kingdom of Norman in the Highlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness..." Leona’s maid looked at her with concern, she had vomited twelve times today, plus this time, a total of thirteen times The things she ate were almost vomited as they were. "We are not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call the priest."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, we have enough gold coins..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call the priest!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid did not dare to violate Leona’s order, she quickly turned and walked out, and the priest in the same hall would soon be coming over, every time after vomiting Liona, a priest who casts the magical spell, can get a breather from this endless torment, but the pastors also solemnly warned Leona that she was too much to be used to restore glory and energy. It’s not a good thing, whether it’s for the fetus or for the mother – if there is any other way, it’s probably the snow honey of the silver crown jungle. Crown Wood shavings of white honey gentle, light taste, very good to soothe the fetus as well as the king of woman emotional unborn. But this kind of snow honey is gradually becoming scarce because of the fall of the White Tower. If there is no war, then the new city built by the Singer Elves in another Dagong territory will replace the White Tower as another trading point, but When the war came, the coalition forces of Grenada and the orcs invaded the silver-crowned jungle. The latest information told them that the enemies of the elves had been expelled from the silver-crowned jungle. The question is, is the royal girl Leona, or Byrdwin was able to face the bleak, if nothing had happened to ask the elves for Snow Honey? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Leona and Byrdwin were expelled and exiled, the elves gave them the most help they could. And Crimmar, to be precise, he has little to do with Birdwin Don Cray, the Elf Ranger Kerry Ben is connected, and Baldwin is a friend of Kerry Ben, and Kremar It is a half-man of Kerry, and this young, black-haired caster not only helps them get rid of King John’s pursuit, but also allows them to represent their own territory, so that the Normans in exile in the Highlands have a place to rest and recuperate – You know, at that time, there was hardly a grandfather or king, or a lord allowed these brave knights to stop on their territory, half out of fear and half out of schadenfreude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they have little to repay this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Elf Ranger Kerry, Leona hardly mentions this name, because once she mentions, there is only one left between her and Bywin. And silence – where did the armor and weapons they used to arm the soldiers come from? Where did the rare spellbooks used to recruit wizards and warlocks come from? Where did the golden cup silver plate used to soothe the people and reward the loyal Sir Alex and the Knights come from? The treasures of the Northern Territory, the elves probably only took a rune piece, or a little souvenir, but those may even be dissatisfied with an ordinary small skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sometimes feels remorse, maybe they should send an army, even if there are only a thousand people, but that is what an ally should do. But the prince can swear to the soul of the pharaoh, she never thought that the orc and the Grenada coalition would be so vulnerable, she thought, if the Singer elves had to give up the jungle, seek her shelter In the land, she will promise, no matter what they ask for Norman’s territory, she will try to discuss with the lords there and find ways to repay the debt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, a heavy debt, she did not mind taking up this debt, even if Baldwin did not insist on his original ideas. She knew that he only gave up his friends and allies for her, Norman, but he had already carried too many shackles and chains, and it was time for someone to dismantle some of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid boldly revealed a disapproval look: "You need to rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me see him," Liona insisted, occasionally She hopes that she is just an ordinary woman. She will selfishly seize Baldwin, not allowing him to leave himself half a step, or follow him closely, holding a banner for him, but as the last of the Norman royal family. The blood, the future ruler, even herself will not allow herself to make such a shallow and stupid behavior: "Please."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid shakes helplessly Shaking her head, she helped Leona to sit up, put on a loose and warm cloak, and poured some cold water into the copper kettle containing the pyroxene powder. The powder of the pyroxene immediately boils and heats up when it encounters water, doping. The spices are then mellow and full of scent due to the high temperature. In the cold winter, this temperature and breath is very pleasant, but in April, even in the highlands Norman, It will make people feel bored, but if they don’t, Female Liao Na will chills, and now she was like a cold-blooded, only by virtue of the action of external forces to make their own warm up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it’s not just the lords who are worried about it, but also the Gavin and the Cavaliers, especially when Bedwin is getting more and more stubborn. I can't imagine what it would be like if Birdwin lost Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaiwen took out his crystal ball and after casting the spell, he carefully searched in the crystal ball, constantly changing the angle and position, and Leona found the position of Birdwin earlier than him. Under the flag of the Grizzly Bear, which was raised in the wind, the tall knight who had been laid down by the visor looked up and saw the sky, between steel and steel. Leona can see the gray eyes she loves. She shows a meager and happy smile. This smile makes Gavin sigh. He keeps the spell until Bedwin turns and raises his arm. He The knight around him blew the horn, the peeping eyes slowly pulled up, and Birdwin's figure narrowed, but Leona was able to find him from hundreds of knights. He was the first in the cone formation and died. The striker is a desperate pointed spear. The orcs ran away under his horseshoe and wide sword. With the horn blowing again, the king and Gavin could clearly see in the wilderness that the formation of the knights changed. , from a few small cone formations to a wide triangle, and Becomes a wide triangular seemingly loose arc, the arc track which ends toward the other side closer continuously, eventually close to form a large network, all of which surround orc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are only images in the crystal ball, there is no sound, but Gavin still unconsciously picks up his eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the behavior that the Cavaliers should have. He said in his heart, while rotating the crystal ball, let the clouds cover the scenes afterwards, "Sorry, Your Highness," he said. "My eyes of peeping are covered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter." Leona smiled and said: "Bedwin has already won." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Gavin replied silently, he won, but what is he doing? He cut down the limbs of the adult orcs, cut open their abdomen, and dragged the little orcs to his feet and dragged them behind the horses until they became meat on the rocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is not the behavior that the Cavaliers should have.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baldwin looked up and looked at the Sir Alex. Even without the information of the Baroness or Gülen, he knew that the Sir Alex was one of the nobles. They despised him, mocked him, and thought he was just A villain who deceived and led you to the prince Li Naina to be forgiven and to gain power, they ignored his 20 years in Thunder, and never looked at him leaving in every battle. The scars, even Tang Klei’s surname is considered by them to be Morton. Don Cray is old and confused, and will easily give such an illegitimate child, and some people who know his true blood, to him and Leona’s children. Full of bitter hatred, only because of his mean blood pollution of the noble Norman royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what about it? He paid so much for Norman in the Highlands. Except for Pharaoh and Leona, no one has the right to accuse him, humiliate him, and despise him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin stood up, taller than most Normans, and even thought that he had the body of the orc blood. A mountain stands in front of the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
