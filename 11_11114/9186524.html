			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theft prevention section, updated tomorrow at 11:30 am. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanwai--Dragon (7) The story of Ingeway and Edelna<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case," said the undead: "Give it to me first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, dear." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ownership of the lamb was suddenly transferred - feeding, etc. No, do you need to ask the opinions of the parties? Fortunately, Ingway doesn't like the undead, and the undead doesn't like it very much. The latter is as thin as the left bone fingers rudely screwing the lamb's back neck and mentioning it all the way. In an empty room, he recited a spell and a transparent cage closed the lamb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the room was closed immediately, now only the lambs themselves, no water, no apples, no warm scorpions... Ingway feels a little bit Sour... He bowed his head and smashed the West Marie inlaid on the Mithril collar. Not sure if he took the last resort to try to get out of the current danger. Should he wait for Gray? But the guy didn't even give him the real name, hehe, of course, he didn't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But maybe he can try to believe him once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Ingwi woke up, he realized that he was asleep, and the lamb is better than the elf. The place is that it has a thick layer of soft fur. He stands up and looks at his hoof. He jumps twice. He doesn't know when it is now. The underground room is wet and cold, without windows, but He can hear the dog barking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so cute," Edell said, and the lamb was shocked by him, only to find that the man was sitting on the wooden beam in the room— - This wooden beam is set to hang the light stand. It is not wide, but the dragon sitting on it is like sitting on a warm and comfortable big bed. "I never thought that you are so suitable for pink." He did A bad expression: "There are bells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamb squirted, and at the same time dissatisfiedly slammed the hoof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it’s my fault," said the dragon, whispering, as he hangs down from the wooden beam, the lamb jumps into his doubles. Between the arms, "I admit that it is my fault."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————— —————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragons seem to have an innate Instinct, able to walk freely like a fish in a building that is unfamiliar, not only the servant of the undead, but even those who lived in it did not appear in front of them, until the lamb once again saw the starry sky, they already On a hill, looking back, you can see that the torch that is like a falling star is lighting up the gloomy castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edell was trying to say something, and was interrupted by the sudden weight of his hand, and Ingway fell from his arm to the ground. The body stretched in white light - the effect of the spell finally disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons picked up the pink ribbons and bells that fell to the ground: "It’s a pity..." He said that it’s not so pleasant to see the elves. When he picked up his arm, he immediately corrected it: "I mean, these little things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingrid gave him a glance: "British Gewei.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edell paused: “Edell.” Then he was silent for a moment and smiled from the bottom of his heart. Ingway twisted his face and smiled almost at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they shared Apple, Edell brought it out of the castle's kitchen - their taste was really wonderful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
