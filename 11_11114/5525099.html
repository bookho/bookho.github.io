			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first image that jumped into the mind of the alien soul was the child he saw outside Beitburg. But in the next second, he knew that this idea was not feasible at all. Think about how he entered the Bibi dike and the White Tower. He still lives in a hotel outside the city - and as a lord, a The caster with noble blood, Beavis's residence is located in one of the best sections in the inner city, and the bureaucracy's official residence is only separated by a 15-foot-high double-walled city wall and a 25-yard yard, three yards. The deep inland river, the neighbors around are not the leader of the guild, the nobility and the mage. Of course, now it has become a bit desolate. People are afraid of the gray robe and the ghost he made, and more worried that he will want to revisit the place. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any case, the people who want to help the alien soul can't even enter the outer city, the public opinion lives here, and as Kerry says, has a peace. A rich living environment is not a fault, it is not a crime. He can't just let a child who wants to be a thief enter here because of pity, causing chaos and atrocities, or worse, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maybe he can This house is rented out and then used to make this rent a fixed source of money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is undoubtedly ridiculed by the Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Even if there are no small souvenirs left by the gray robe, he said that those who are qualified to live here will not want to choose such a miserable one. If you die and you are forced to ruin your home for more than ten years, even if you have one or two madmen looking for death, then you need to draw your attention to the fact that on this continent, all charitable acts are crowned with gods, individuals. The good deeds are neither esteemed nor trusted. Oh, of course, if you are willing to believe in hypocritical white robes, you can also pray for their help, although nine out of ten will reject purposeful donations. And the remaining tenth will be happy to accept and tell you that you have no right to make irresponsible remarks about your money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most critical, once the undead can be said to be happy to point out that you think that the bread you gave can be with the eyes of everyone, Bright gold coins, beautiful satin clothes, delicious wine and meat steaks? They will still find ways to find an opportunity to make a difference. Everything you do will only become a hotbed of more comfort, which breeds corruption and sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the savvy innocent soul is neither angry nor depressed, he is only silent for a while - how did those people come? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Injury or alcoholism to unemployed adventurers, criminals who are expelled and exiled, because of famine or thieves who abandoned the land of peasants, escaped slaves, mixed hybrids and other unacceptable rubbish - the lich is careless The answer is that the lord of Biyindi Fort is already generous enough to see the White Tower. Although it has a half-elf lord, the tower of Rosada stands here, but you can’t see it within a hundred miles. Even a stranger who has no identity and is doubtful and dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I think that the soul of the opposite world said after being silenced for a long time, perhaps the pastor of Rosada will be happy to accept the gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The scream screams - he has no interest in this room, but that doesn’t mean he is happy that the former enemy is getting any benefit from him. - Do you think they will be willing to help you to accommodate those dirty little devils? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- They can use it as a store, warehouse or to entertain guests who want to sleep late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I don't allow it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Don't be like this, the soul of the outside world can't help but hold your hand, you said you don't need this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-This is not a problem I need not need! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Theft, the right to use, the Lich’s fellow people appease him, it still belongs to you, but it is not ruined, so we will come to Baita later. You don't have to live in a hotel or in the sanctuary of Rosada. What do you think? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--The former undead must admit that he was convinced--if you can guarantee that they are not there to worship Rosada and sing the damn hymn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalale is very happy to accept this small gift, for the god of the morning light of many aristocrats and even members of the royal family, the ultimate property of the house is Who is not very important in their hands, they care about whether the place can allow them to enter, the priests of the god of morning light are eager to dispel the negative energy and the possible ghosts that are thicker and colder day after day, clean up. And purify the entire wilted courtyard, paint the walls, tidy up the houses, hang up the curtains, and make sure that it is clean and bright even when uninhabited – when they meet the first morning, from the fifth Looking down at the ten-foot tower, you can see the little black spot wrapped in misfortune and sin at first sight. The gray robes are simply the most shameless in these devout white robes. Provocative and insulting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that according to the laws of Baita, even the pastor of the god of morning light does not have the right to invade his territory without the owner's permission. It is a crime and seriously violates the teachings of Rosada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can only be patient, and no one has thought that Beavis has disappeared for nearly two decades. Some Rosada believers even want to use their rights. Going to find him or someone who can inherit his property, but fortunately, before they acted, that person appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think we will transform the first floor into a small copying room," Rosada’s pastor asked briskly: "The sun is very good, the courtyard is vast." And close to the river - after dispelling those unpleasant things, the entire West Wing will be preserved, you can use it at any time, you can withdraw it at any time, I mean, the whole house."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me a room." Kremar said: "I will spend the next few years in Gray Ridge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been to Gray Ridge," Yadel said with a smile, he is a young man with linen hair, with a pair of bright brown eyes and a lovely round face, perhaps because of the god's preference, Rosa You can rarely find old and ugly in the pastor of Da, he will even give his beloved pastor a little grace to keep their show beauty and energy, but Yadel is indeed just 19 years old in March this year, his The heart is still between the child and the adult, so he likes to travel around and People of similar ages talked and said: "There are half elves and elves. The buildings are exquisite and peculiar. There are green plants and beautiful flowers everywhere. Birds walk between the pillars and the horns, and there are squirrels in the squirrels. Sunbathe on your window sill, grab the nuts and berries from your breakfast plate - you might like it there, but if you can, I hope you can always go back to the White Tower and your tutor has lived here for a long time. For a while, he will leave more traces than you did."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I will." Kremar said: "Even if I just came to see you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went two steps before he found that Yadel did not follow up, turned around and noticed that the pastor was Looking at him with a stunned look, the black-haired caster blinked and found that he had just said something casually, ah, decent words - the bad problems that have been developed on the Internet for a long time, he may have to be grateful I didn’t use that “pro”, I have to know that in the lingua franca of the mainland, Dear "is also very easy to pronounce a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
