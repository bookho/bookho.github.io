			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danos is exhausted, even if he is standing next to him, he can be said to be the elite of Grenada, but in any case, they are all living, and Not the undead who can't feel the pain and exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can feel that the warlocks around him are breaking a wand, not a good thing, compared to their capricious leader, a Grenada warlock is less than It’s a last resort that won’t use a wand or a reel, because these are their killers or the last escape. Danos has no doubt that if it’s not a frenzied magic zone, and the lich has a lot of possibilities. If you limit the use of transport-like spells, the only remaining caster of them might drop them off the table, but even if he didn't think of them, the lessons of the previous car were enough to dispel this reverie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, they have been forced to think about how to make it hard for people around you to die before they are dead, they are still in a broken, but still retain A rounded room with a half-wall creates a defensive circle. The warlock is responsible for defending the ghosts and demons. The knights are fighting against the lich dog, the zombie and the steel golem. Danos, who has both the warlock and the thief, manages Repel any horrible enemy who tries to tear open the gap from the gaps that the former two have no time to consider. He has no time to breathe, even when confronting the enemy, he should pay attention to other places, just like now, he concentrates. Waving his arm, a steel spider gothic overturned on his sword, because it was climbing, the result of not being able to find enough footholds was that the ground was rolling straight down, and when it rolled down, it still lingered. Its companion. When throwing a spell, Danos has pulled out the short sword, dangerously running through the head of a lich dog, it has fallen into them, but has not had time to find a victim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock’s hair has been soaked in fine sweat, and he is reaching the limit as well - he hesitates to hold his jewel pendant while hesitating It should be used here, this time - making a decision for him is a ghost, it mourns hoarsely, used to scare the living, while extending the finger to the caster, its touch makes the warlock's hand The elbow suddenly paralyzed and icy, his left hand slipped down weakly, and felt a mess at the same time. The harsh training in the Grenada Warlock Tower allowed him to immediately raise his right hand, but the second ghost came from his back. The party rushed, his right hand had already held the pendant, but could not force it. The curse of the ghost made him unable to concentrate again. He wanted to shout and pray for the help of Danos, but his tongue was also Freeze it - when the warlock fell, his consciousness was very clear. He saw that the two ghosts couldn’t wait to rush and wave their arms. Their imaginary limbs would not cause harm to humans and could cause harm. Only their voice Touch, but they don't know, or don't care, they hate all the living, I hope they can die with their endless resentment, and the ghost is a zombie, and Different ghosts, zombies can use their white teeth to tear the body that flows warm blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grenada’s red robe is scared, he is not threatened by abuse and death, not the first time he sniffs the breath of mourning the wilderness But he is very clear that this time he may not really escape, he prayed that his soul could escape the hunter's pursuit, not to be swallowed and used as currency, but then he was keenly aware that this kind of Fear is not just brought by ghosts and zombies, not even from the lich - he sees the ghosts that are only a stone's throw away from him, and then becomes transparent in the blink of an eye, like sugar cane ablation The disappearance in the water disappears without a trace, and the zombies are like the weird dolls piled up in the desert. In a slight tremor, they begin to shatter from the skull and are smaller than the sand. Flowing down, a small pointed cone was piled up in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the warlock felt another wave of magic, and when a sly flash of soft white light fell on his vision, he realized that The black-haired dragons may be much stronger than they think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead creatures whisper, the ghosts are broken, the zombies and the lichs are turned into sand, the demons cursing and fleeing, only the steel spiders are still following the master The order tried to kill the invaders, but their power was single and the previous collapses were also damaged. At least the Grenadas had completely solved these problems when their leaders returned to them. Datunda’s troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-haired dragon is different from their imagination. He can even seem to be unscathed, except for the loss of a red robe. Under the red robe is a knee-length white robe with a simple style and no pattern. It is incompatible with the noble style of Grenada. "The bottomless abyss is down," the warlock said in a complicated way: "He is like a The pastor of Tell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companion gave him a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danos took a deep breath, and he only thought that he didn’t seem to see the bone dragon again, and there was a giant cockroach: The dragon..." he asked hesitantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not a dragon," said Kremar calmly. "It's just a pseudo-dragon's corpse." And now only bone powder is available. . And after being absorbed by negative energy, those bone powders may only be used for feed or for incorporation into ceramics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock heard a disappointing look, he converges quickly, but he still sees the black-haired dragons smile at him, "but I think In view of the fact that it used to be the territory of the undead who almost became the demigod of the demon, we can still find something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," he continued Say: "What we need to find first is fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they heard laughter, but waited for their Highness to reach out, Little Devil Smodios showed his physique: "Fortunately, not to be insulted, my respectful and powerful master," he said diligently and proudly, and did not mention an undetectable gap or hole. The silver string on the neck went first to spy on the shameless behavior: "Yes, I found it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----- ——————————————————————————————————————— —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“So we only see a lover lich.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are willing to call her a monk lich," said the dark-haired dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not surprising." The warlock said: "I always feel that there is an unspeakable sense of violation." The Lich does indeed concoct and use toxic Potion, but disguise yourself, and then hope that the enemy will drink it. This is not something that every lich will do - it can only be called a trick like a mischief, especially if his enemy is only 寥寥More than a dozen times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a monk Lich is very reasonable to do this, her strength is far less than the Lich, and there are always some servants who she can’t control. Not to mention that she lacked enough wisdom and pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average adventurer may have difficulty guessing the release of countless spells, the main fort hiding the steel golem, zombies, lich dogs and ghosts is not the lich The real hiding place, but her life is not hidden in the place outside the dying spirit. After all, the outside world is a frenzied magic zone, and no one knows what kind of devastating and influential life will be there. It is buried in a square underground reservoir in the two suburbs behind the main fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These waters exude a scent like a newborn lich, and all lichs, unless they are successful, immediately pack themselves into a bone shelf. Otherwise, this process is inevitable - the black water is like a mirror, reflecting the top gems. When the outsiders invade, they climb out of the pool like the tentacles of the living creatures, entangled them. Take their vitality - poor mud bats are pleading and cursing in lingua franca and aquarium, but their voices can't pass through the thick stone gates and walls, they attack with acid and stink clouds, but unfortunately Black water has no nose and no skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the black waters are finished eating and ready to return to the reservoir with a strange satisfaction, one can make them feel like they are suffering It’s happening in the blue sky - their home is gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t say how black water was found everywhere in the underground stone chamber that was once again sealed, a dragon tooth knight looking at the creature in front of him in awe A worm that is more than 20 feet in diameter when it is in a circle. This worm has almost the adult dragon that is not as long as the tail. A common person needs to run ten heartbeats. The body is more than five feet in diameter. Wisteria The thick skin of the flower has a regular texture, the abdomen is the same, but the moss is green, its head and the skull are split from the middle, and the mouth is full of dense teeth. They swallow the captured prey faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Knight wants to ask if he will be attacked. Anyway, he is about to open the belly of the worm, but in the end he still gives up It is more horrible to question a warlock's spell than to irritate a purple bug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
