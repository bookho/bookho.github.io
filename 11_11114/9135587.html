			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke of Tilan is a knight, although he has never been loyal to any god, but his room still has a small black similar to the ornament. Iron balance, tapestry also has a pattern of laurel leaves and starlight. His wife will give gold coins and clothing to the shrines such as Sinn Nos, Woking, and Ke Lanwo every ten days, and met Yi Er. Mort's pastor will also give generously, but he knows very well that he is not a devout believer. He does not know if he can go to the mourning for the wilderness to hear the voices of the gods, just like he wants to When the priests of the temple ask for help, they may not be able to get their helper. He stood up from behind the desk and walked anxiously in the room. Before tonight, he thought he had time, or a way, but The Rinada people came so fast, like a whirlwind in the desert, and they swept through every inch of his land in a flash—no, maybe his capital, but Dagong knew that this calm would not Lasting too long<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a way to take my daughter?" Dagong looked at his uncle with hope. He lost the country and he is not willing to live as a despicable civilian. His wife should be willing to be with him, but if his daughter can deliver to a trustworthy person and enough gold coins as a dowry, she You can still be peaceful in a place that is not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grenada people have limited the use of transmission spells." His uncle, an old red robe walked to the window, outside is boundless Infinite darkness, but he seems to be able to find the enemy in the shadows that are as thick as a nightmare: "The nets woven by their wizards and warlocks can cover the entire city and the surrounding wilderness, His Royal Highness," he said cruelly. "And your blood must be cut off so that they can guarantee that no one will organize resistance in your name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Bell is just a girl," Dagong tried hard to win: "A girl, it is not worthy of their concern, she does not have the right to inherit, even if she is still alive, she will not cause any hindrance to anyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It’s a mistake to flow your blood," the warlock said. "And I’m afraid that I can’t escape bad luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grenada people? Isn't it consistently favored by the caster?" Dagong said: "As long as you are willing to give him Devotional loyalty, kneeling at the foot of the 'mother', I don’t think they would mind your surname.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His uncle shook his head: “Previously Maybe," he said. "They may have more than thirty casters, and they are all battle mage and warlocks. Do you understand that they are here to harvest their lives."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, their words are not trustworthy," said Dagong. "Since they only want to see death, maybe they are just cheating and intimidating us - uncle, is it possible? ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have tens of thousands of soldiers and three thousand "The knight," said Dagong: "They have only a thousand people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A thousand elite eagle lions and devils "The warlock said: "Do you know how they got here through the majority of the Principality within a few days? I collected the information in detail from the emigrants. ...the their caster rides on the lion's lion, which can fly and bite, their claws are sharper than the dagger, and with the exception of the dragon, there is hardly anything that can fly against them - and Warlocks and spells throw spells from the beast's body. The height of the lion's body can not only ensure that the arrow of the brakes can touch their fur, but also ensure the maximum power of magic. In the outbreak, soldiers and knights can only run away from the wall, but there is no way to escape the flames, lightning, poisonous fog and ice - after the resistance on the wall is dissipated, the Devils will climb with their own knights. On the upper wall, their claws are not inferior to the lion beast. When they are caught, they can leave deep grooves on the stone bricks. They climb the wall like apes, and they are like their owners. The clawed dragon is covered with black iron and steel armor. No spear can penetrate it, and the sword will break on it. Our soldiers are wary of the beasts of the beasts in addition to the weapons of the Grenada. The human body is like a crisp parchment for them. No matter how many soldiers we have," he said: "It is only a matter of time for them, and the final outcome will not change. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should leave earlier." In fact, his courtiers suggested that they abandon the capital and leave here, but they were rejected by the Grand Duke. He admitted that he had a lucky heart and that he valued his dignity more than life.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong smiled blankly. He and his uncle...the relationship cannot be said to be very harmonious. After all, both of them are very stubborn. He never thought that one day he would cry for his uncle, but this is true. At the time, he hoped that it would never come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do they really keep their promises?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have no choice." Warlock said "Two endings, one, we resist at all costs, and then we are slaughtered by the Grenada people, or leave some slaves; Second, we give up resistance, open the gates, and our people will still become slaves. But at least it doesn't have to die tonight. But no matter which ending, we can only welcome the messenger of Klanwo, let him take us to mourn the wasteland." He paused: "No, it is different," He said: "I think if we are willing to give up our lives, we can leave faster and more enjoyable. I heard that the army of Grenada likes to put their captives on the flagpole." The old caster is witty. Made a gesture: "From the butt to the mouth, it is like a roast chicken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandfather gave him a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you think that the owner of the little devil wants to do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There may be What makes him need a lot of slaves.” The warlock said: “Who knows?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well,” said Dagong, after learning about his ending. Instead, he was no longer so annoyed: "But I don't think this decision is what I can do," he said, sitting back at his desk. "Let my people decide where to go."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————————————————————————— —————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil Asmodeos has been paying attention to the movement of the Grand Duke, and it has seen several horses squatting The knights rushed out of the inner wall and stepped into the street. The knights wore cloaks embroidered with the Grand Duke's coat of arms, holding torches and looking grim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These knights are rushing to the place where people gather. When the war is about to start, no one will go to sleep peacefully. Everyone is dressed very neatly. When the knights shouted, they all got up, some from the bed, some from the chair, some from the straw, and some from the cold and damp ground, they flocked to the small square formed by the cross street, the knights There, they read out the wishes of the Grand Duke - just like every time before, but this time people can't believe what they heard, they rushed to whisper, some people resolutely demanded the Grinada There was a deadly battle, and some people immediately became hesitant, especially the refugees. Among them, there was no shortage of people who had seen the knights and monsters with their own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the time left for them to discuss and consider is not long, the Greinada people only leave them a night, until the morning light passes through the deep blue sky, When the Milky Way falls, they are about to start attacking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the city about a hundred miles away, the Grenada army is stationed in a small town, not so much a small town, it is better It is said to be a manor that is specially configured to facilitate the management of hills and plains. The main building of the manor is a building with fifty rooms. The interior decoration is not luxurious enough but also very comfortable. It is used by the Greinada people to house their captain and caster - the third floor, also the middle of the highest level. The room is the most extravagant and wide, undoubtedly belonging to the black-haired dragon, late at night, as a caster he should have rested, but he still has one thing to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small meeting with only four captains and representatives of the casters, as well as Krimaar and his little devil Asmody Oss, Ms. Gray robe declined the invitation. She didn't care what they were going to do. Anyway, she only followed the order of Kremar. As for other possible opponents, on the surface, the number is zero - the two captains of Longya and their team members still owe a large sum of money to Cremal, given that their mounts must be captured after the capture of the city and the city. For a big carnival, the captain of the dragon claws does not have to endure the suffering of unscrupulous businessmen, but most of the casters are in the dragon tooth, and the fear claw dragon is still on the recipe of the lion head animal, he is also I don’t want to be suddenly attacked by the wizard or the warlock’s spells on the battlefield, or by a lion’s lion and beast with a mount, so he also wisely kept silent. As for the dragon thorns, their number It is the least. In this case, the captain will only smile. Although the smile is a little stubborn, the lich can accept. Anyway, his most powerful subordinate is unfortunately killed by the leader of the city. This is also the case. So far, the only unpleasant news, the other, even the lion's lion body and the deinonychus did not appear to be damaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
