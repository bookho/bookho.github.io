			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ps: Watch the exclusive story behind The Saints, listen to your suggestions for the novel, follow the public number (WeChat add friends - add public number - enter Qdread can), tell me quietly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 24: Snake Man<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!" Ranger loudly provocatively, cross double The knives let them reveal a bright glow and a loud, crisp knock, so that dangerous enemies can focus on themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The otter that is attracted and irritated comes to him as he wishes, its body swings from side to side, but the head is suspended in the air, black diamonds Huanren stared at Kerry Ben in a sneak peek. It was much more savage than its companions. It perceived that the tough opponent in front of him was not without weakness - it turned sharply and pounced on the other side of the one-eyed mercenary, one-eyed The missing eye became the reason why it might be placed on the enemy. He did not relax his vigilance and held the weapon in his hand, but his vision had a big dead angle. He had only had time to turn his head and face the health. Pink gums, four rows of teeth (two rows for biting, two rows for swallowing), and black holes with unfathomable throat; Ranger made an angry roar, he strove hard and almost skipped a third The boat, jump into the trap that the otter has prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The otter immediately gave up the mercenary as a bait, which strongly contracted the muscles, and the triangular head slammed back and bit the elf The shoulders, the barbed teeth and the powerful squats instantly shattered the Mithril locks deeply embedded in Kerry's skin and muscles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who loves to sleep is unconsciously cringing when he sees the elf's painful expression. "Don't be stupid!" One-eyed screaming, rushing to slam the water Awkward body: "They are guards, they are killers, they are not cute when you give food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One-eyed is right," The middle-aged mercenary said that he stepped forward and pulled out his sword: "And we can't kill it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s just got water The embarrassed tail swept into the river, and his companion turned his eyes to the spot. He couldn’t decide to help the one-eyed and the ranger, or try to catch the other one. The final decision for him was Kerry Ben, who won a little time for him. He waved the silver crown, stabbed in and pulled out the yellow eyeball that was close at hand, and continued to go inside. The threat of death made that piece. The cold-blooded behemoth suddenly became mad. It struggled to get rid of the elf's shoulder and the deadly blade. The free elf gasped and retreated. The severe pain made him feel faint, but he still stood still and turned. And go with the mercenaries to deal with it - the elf has only one hand to use, but his efficiency is still higher than humans, his knife is cut in the same position, and when the otter turned around When he wants to bite them, his machete can counterattack one or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It almost exhausted all of Kerry's energy. He heard the merchants yelling again - the wooden box that fell into the snake's head turned over because of the shaking of the ship, the snake head fell out and bitten an apprentice. The thighs, the frightened people have stepped back, they have not noticed that someone is waiting for them in the water - the caster has always been concerned about this, if the body is now controlling the soul of the outside world, then he must Will not hesitate to tear open the last reel, a shock circuit, is the highest level of spells he has been able to copy so far - the Lich certainly does not do that, he never cares about the lives of others (those can be used as materials or The exception to the test article), he is even ready, when Kerry asks, he will tell him that this spell will also harm the innocent people. This is the truth, it is true, even if Tyre is coming. Can't blame him for panicking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he should be more predicting the power of human beings at the moment of life and death. It must be that he was unfortunately infected by cohabitants with mentally ill bacteria. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Kerry Ben flapping over and grabbing the bow and arrow - the sharp arrow bent when he hit his white robe, and the long arrow fell to the ground - - This guy must have nailed him to the deck so that he won't be dragged away by something, but this clever little elf never thought about why he always wears this dress? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the undead were in the water, they sneered at the elf's sorrow and ripped open the reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, that’s so spectacular, even the mage apprentice who sticks the eggshell on the butt knows that the power of the electric shock spell in the water will double, like Your enemies are wearing metal armor, the dazzling current is rushing in the water and the air, giving off a smell of smell, all creatures jumping out of the water, humans jumping shorter, snakes jumping Higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current also acts on the body of the lich. The pain is inevitable, but it can be tolerated. He opens his eyes in the water and looks for the edge of the barge. The roar of the machinery seemed to be in the ear, and the metal wheel that could drive such a big punt and its cargo would not be small. He saw it, and the wheel of the execution was like a sharp light. , tirelessly spinning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of claws interrupted the caster's thinking, he almost had to pay for his carelessness, sharp as a knife cut his hair, As soon as the black hair broke away from his body, it instantly turned into a little white light, which scared the raiders. He thought it was a spell, and he threw his tail back in fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companion, an albino snake, made a disapproving voice. In the water, the sound that human beings could not hear was harsh and chaotic. With the commanding elements, he grabbed the middle-aged mercenary, and the mercenary looked at the mage in horror. A hand was extended to him, and the snake man lowered his head and bit his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard rushed over before the fearful retreating snakeman reacted. His speed was no slower than the idiots with tails, and the degree of flexibility was even far. Beyond them, the snakeman screamed, its iron trident collided with the wizard's fine sword, and the snakeman found that the opponent had the same strength as he did after two or three rounds. The last time the wizard's fine sword caught him. The iron trident and wrist, the clear groundwater is again contaminated by stinky blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even with one hand missing, the snake man still has many weapons, his other claw, his teeth and his tail, and he has a companion . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master gave him the final blow. The stiletto pierced the snake's chest. When he wanted to draw the sword, the snake man bent his back and bite. After living the sword, the venom ejected from the tip of the tooth corroded the prismatic steel, which caused it to be folded into two sections at the time of the collision with the second iron trident. The mage made the side between the calcium carbide fire. Over the white snake's weapon, grabbed his arm and forced him to give up his weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white snake’s tail wraps from below and wraps around the mage’s waist, and the mage’s other hand wraps from the back to the front, pressing with the forearm His neck, the front chest tightly attached to the back of the scales, the half-human monster tightened the muscles of the whole body, including the neck and tail against him, his claws scratched, but could not pass outside In the defense of the robe, he changed his attack on the leg without the protection of the robe. The skin that was quickly caught was fleshy and bloody. The blood was like the mage's hair. It did not dissipate or solidify in the water, but turned into subtle Light spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the people who have been dragged into the water by the snakes are dead. A bloated body floats past the mage’s eyes, and the roots are surrounded by the light. The silver string on the neck became extraordinarily conspicuous. Under the call of the master, it broke away from the body of Foster and changed his second command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rope entangles the paw of the white snake, binds it to its owner, and the lich wants to break the scale mucus The neck - it is very painful to be scratched by five pointed living figures like the claws of a small dagger! But after listening to a few heartbeats, he changed his mind. He grabbed the snake's hair like a seaweed and slipped his hair. He knocked his face on the hard stone wall, only one time, the one was covered with transparent scales. The ugly face without a nose or lips is recessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
