The even more compact and chic, they will be engraved with shells and fish on the folding grills, and some even lost. The original correct form, just because the gnomes are more willing to add more lines, so each shell and every fish is like a full flower - the dwarf is different, the dwarf's weapon is in addition to the necessary caster Name, the name he took for this weapon, and the magical runes that only some weapons have, only the vertical and horizontal stripes to enhance strength, friction and recognition - this is also reflected in their statues, the dwarf carvings Neither gold nor paint, the original lead gray of the rock, all the statues are extremely tall - even if he was originally a dwarf, it is also up to 20 feet, with a dome on his head and feet on the pedestal. There are only one or two pieces of jewelry on the body, even if they are kings, and they are almost uniform wearing long blouses, jackets and spurs, iron boots wrapped around their feet, the only thing worthy of the gnome of McGee There is only a vivid look (they are very serious, but none of them are similar to other "people") and an engraving technique that fully expresses the material of their clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After passing through the iron gate, the gnome McGee could hardly control himself and wanted to spy on it. The gnomes also used springs to make bows and jumps. Box (that is, the box that shoots poison arrows when opened), or used to make hanging scales, leather bags, shock absorbers on horse-drawn carriages, etc., but they have not been able to make elbows so far. Spring (maybe, but hidden by the gnome who knows this sly), but when he sees the door, he can estimate how big the spring can pull the door, and even if he doesn't estimate it, that The spring can also be seen with a slight shadow. The dwarf does not seem to care about being seen by a gnome, but Kerry bent to push McGee into his arms and cover his eyes with his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dwarf smiled at the elves, his body was filled with a smell of oil, metal and sulfur, and perhaps ale and barbecue. Or three days ago, he climbed into a squirrel nest to find the rancid smell that was lost in the missing semi-finished ring, but he didn't feel it. To be honest, many dwarves even thought of their smell. Showing his masculinity, there is always a lot of female dwarves with beautiful beards willing to dance with them - the armor he is equipped with is not as sharp as some dwarves, but still drums a lot of obtuse The embarrassment, these cockroaches can not only remove the strength of the enemy's weapons on the plate, but also allow any enemy to break the blood in this solid stainless steel ornament - even if they do not want to come, the dwarf Will also be willing to pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one of his most striking features is his nose, red, and round, like a tomato or an overfilled meatball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Valentin is waiting for you." He yelled and let them keep up with him. Gülen noticed that behind them was a dwarf guard, holding Shiny spears, this can be said to be protection or can be said to be surveillance, just how you understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They first entered a black hole ramp, which exudes a stale smell that cannot be recognized by dwarves or gnomes - after the ore tunnel is abandoned The smell lingers around everyone, this may be a way of warning for the dwarves, Baldwin thinks so, but Perant does not think so, the dwarves are extremely proud of their achievements and merits, since they are invited friends Then the dwarves will take them from the richest and the widest and the latest martyrdom. He still remembers the fascinating journey of the last time he came to the Iron Bone City. The dwarves held the torch high, letting the torch illuminate the rock wall and the top of the cave, or the ground, and every place where the line of sight fell was golden and silver, with intermittent silver and blue light. Gold and silver are embedded in dark gray walls like entangled silk, black and gray striped merle, golden stellite and pyrite, and little calcite. Milky stone and arsenopyrite, they look like a lake in the moonlight thrown ripples, but also like blinking stars in the dark sky, beautiful, and means that significant amount of wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Perant always feels a low and tense mood among the dwarves, is it an orc? When the Druid thinks this way, they have already passed the ramp and stood in front of a lift - this is another change, the dwarves trust the machine, but they don't trust the magic, even if they often create powerful magic. Weapons, but in daily life, they can try not to touch magic with magical contact, and the accessories of the lift are built by the dwarves, but it is not the dwarf technology that makes it fast and light. A rune containing magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They embarked on a lift that resembled an iron cage, and the round nose dwarf slammed into the gate, which was like a signal, the lift was in the slightest After the earthquake began to rise rapidly, in the dark vertical tunnel, the people inside the lift not only need to squeeze and suffer from bumps, Birdwin reached out to bring Leona into his arms, the gnome grabbed Kay Reuben's neck, Perant and Kremar stood between Gülen and Plum, this time Mei Mei woke up is the only daughter of love, people think she will be furious about the betrayal of Gülen and his voters. At least once again, killing Gülen, but to their surprise, this goddess can be said to be an extraordinary tolerance, although she told Glan Meimi with a sweet smile that she will never wake up again, leaving her After that, the body and the original soul will also be wiped out. When all the spells and the magic are unable to save it, Gülen almost killed her again, but this time the soul from another plane advances. Controlled the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you knew," the soul of the outside world said calmly to Gülen: "The words of the enemy are not credible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's weird," Gülen He said in a hoarse voice: "I know that most of the Masters have no respect for the gods, but you are obviously the most vivid one. You are not afraid of God, but you have never placed them in a different position from you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world lazily reaches out and touches the head of the thief. Of course he knows why this is - he has done nearly thirty The materialists and atheists of the year, and starting from a young child with ignorance and ignorance, even the most powerful caster of this plane will not pay tribute to the gods, but he can't, these should only appear in the computer. And the illusory existence on the movie screen, if placed in his plane... well, he can almost imagine, like someone in an ancient Eastern country, the fastest when he sees a strange creature. The three thoughts that jump into my mind are - how can I eat or not? Eat good? Humans only think about it - how can it be used? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human greed can't be with the devil or with it, in this plane, under the suppression of other fierce and powerful races, in the gods Under the temptation and guidance of human beings, human beings can still be seen as one of the largest races with short lifespan, weak power and fragile body - and in another plane, there is no god, no devil, only Science, without talent, as long as there is intelligence to master the power, it is to let humanity develop to a point where the ancients can't think of it, here, and their arrogance and arrogance have reached a terrible peak. Sometimes, the former undead will also think about it. If the plane of his cohabitation is discovered by the gods, who will be the ultimate winner? At the end of the day, he was not surprised to find that he was not sure that the gods would win the final victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their bodies may surrender, their souls will surrender, but their thoughts, that unpredictable uncontrollable thoughts, if they are still allowed to keep them Civilization and science, then these ideas will eventually lead to abandonment and rebellion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a small snoring ended their thoughts, and the long and depressed journey finally passed. They jumped off the elevator and headed for a horizontal ramp. There was a gap between the lift and the platform connected to the horizontal ramp. The dwarf jumped over and the gnome screamed and buried the face with the elf's neck. In his shoulders, he didn't dare to look at the deep squats like the cracks of the night. The round nose dwarf made a sigh, not for anything else, but among them, the human female gesture was the most wonderful, she was like In flight instead of walking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this lateral passage, climb a narrow step, and after three consecutive turns, they finally saw the white light, from the other end of the ramp, there was warm wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, after they walked through this short martyr, they saw what the dwarf Valentine had seen before, the kind of beauty, power and beauty that made it The soul from another plane is deeply impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ramp leads to a narrow stone bridge. There is no guardrail on the stone bridge. Only a dwarf is allowed to walk on it. There is a whole team in front of the stone bridge. The Dwarf Guards, if they are enemies, even if they can rush through the stone bridge with dense arrows, they will be pushed down the lava pool by the spears. When they walk through the stone bridge, the souls of the outside world will look down boldly - his The fear of heights has long been cured by flying. It is found that after the dwarf's exquisite design, the following seems to be criss-crossing. There is always a cable suspension bridge that can catch you. It is an illusion. People who fall from the stone bridge unless they look at it. The position is violently jumped, otherwise it is absolutely impossible to escape a life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valentin received the adventurers in the dwarf's hall. When I saw Perant, the wrinkles of the old dwarf stretched a bit: "I thought I I can't see you anymore," he said, warmly embracing Perant (Perant was half-squatting to match his height). "Are we the last time we met in Longwei Valley?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to literally," Perant said: "Should not, I know that you also went to see me when I was asleep." This is the king of the jungle. Gewei’s franchise, the dwarf Valentine, still remembers how sad he was when he saw Perant’s quiet and gentle sleep in the lake. After waking up, Perant asked the caravan to hand over a letter and tell The old friend himself was safe, but at that time, Valentine was already the manager of the Iron Bone City, and Perant was the manager of the Gray Ridge. Both of them were responsible for the task, and they could not leave the Iron Bone City unless they had major events. Gray Ridge, once again meeting has become distant, so this time Enough to see Pelant, Valentin is also very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The round-nose dwarf brought them a ale, which is one of the dwarf's favorite drinks, and the devil's wine was specially added with honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going to the North Sea," Valentin said. "I know," the dwarf’s eyes flashed with wise light: "You want To use our tunnel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the Longwei Tunnel." Perant said: "One of the greatest and most amazing projects of the Dwarf. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
