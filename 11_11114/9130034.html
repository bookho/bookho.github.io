			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitette doesn’t want to talk to Kremar about whether a male lion and a beast is evil enough. Before he leaves, the male lion is still In the confrontation with Griffin, and he left only a very small moment, in order to solve this trouble, he did not ride the lizard but used the horse. If it is not the king that limits the application of the transmission spell, he It is also possible to transfer Cremari to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to other eagle lions and beasts, knowing that the eagle lion beast has never been a group that cares about morality and affection, even if Riffin was caught, and they could have swarmed up, but sometimes they were despicable as a human being. When Mittite looked over, the lions and lions were not looking at the ground with concentration. It's like having a toe on their front paws, looking up at the sky, like a beautiful female face lion beast flying between the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several eagle-headed lions in the sand, and they are in the position of the lion's lion and the dragon tooth knight. The captains in the middle, that is, their masters are similar, but Mitt is not considered to be hurting to rescue Griffin - if so, Griffin will at least not suffer such a big shame. The scars on them may have been left because they wanted to defeat the male lion beast that defeated their leader, Griffin. The black male lion beast is not polite to Griffin. No, Mittitch thought with a headache that he might have to use his own inventory to get Griffin back to life before the game, just like the owners of these lions and lions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cremar," he turned and said softly: "If you really want a male lion body beast as a mount... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One." The soul of the opposite world corrects: "The human face lion beast is completely different from the lion-faced lion beast. It seems to me A human face lion beast can be seen as a human being. He is not my mount, but my companion." He said, then turned to the male lion beast that no longer counts feathers: "Your Is the challenge over?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“End, my dear friend,” the male lion body slashed his neck with his hind paws, “Most me I have already shouted loudly, and surrounded the entire camp, I saw thousands of lions and lions, but they didn't seem to want to confront me." But some eagle lions want to ride. Familiar with the terrain and sneak attack on this strange lion beast with the help of the owner, but the male lion beast immediately taught them how to be a safe bird - Just as Mittcott can't refute Krimaar, the male lion can be used as a high-level priest to cast spells on all priest spell lists, and some may be classified as good. The magic of medical and protection, he is like a powerful white robe with wings, and more than 100 years of combat experience and corresponding qualities. Therefore, above the magic, even the sheep and lions are not as good as the beasts. The eagle lions and beasts that can only use the sharp shackles and claws to harm the enemy cannot be compared with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," the soul of the alien world sighed: "This is really great." He said to Mitt, "I have some concerns before." If my companion can't beat Griffin, maybe there are other challengers, I might need to find another new friend, but now it seems that I don't need to do anything more."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might's look is like someone who has a hard-spoken salt in his mouth. Of course he doesn't want a male lion beast, especially the brother's so-called companion to become the eagle The leader of the lion beast, as he never thought of to hand over the dragon tooth, but what can he say? Kreima’s mount was even challenged in the way of Grenada. There was no etiquette, no discussion, no things other than force. In fact, if he can, he is willing to have a human face lion beast as a mount, or to replace each mount in the dragon tooth with the former, so that the strength of the dragon tooth may be doubled, tripled, or possibly More, but as he said before and Kremar, the human face lion beast is dismembered by living, and is not willing to succumb to any of the Grenada people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe you are right." Mitt said that he tried not to let his tone be full of resentment and anger, but even outside the world. The soul can still hear a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-haired dragon looks at the male-faced lion beast, and the pair is like the night, and a pair of eyes like the sun touches and immediately leaves, but both sides know The other party is snickering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Court of Myrtute?" The soul of the alien world asked in a serious way: "Brother? Mittite? Brother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to try a new saddle?" Mitt said temptedly, if this lion-faced beast is really evil as Kremar said, then he hopes it can be evil to accept another Master, no matter where he looks, he is more powerful and rich than Kremar. Isn't it? "The saddle made of the dragon dragon skin of the Deinonychus, light and soft, makes you feel that there is no binding, and the chain of the Mithril can be connected to protect your front and back hips." The eldest son of the eldest son described: "The above can also be embellished with your favorite gems." Of course he did not think that a saddle can buy a human face lion beast, but as long as it accepts, then Mittite There are always more ways to turn it to favor yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male lion body animal has been listening to him quietly, showing great patience, until finally he reveals a hidden and sardonic smile: "I hate the fear Dragon skin," he said. "They smell like the buttocks of a bird. Maybe you really like it, but they are probably made in the stool. It should be, I heard that all the babies are soaked in their own stools. - There are also Mithril and gems, fools, I am not a girl, are you mistaken, do you want to see my cockroaches?" He said, threatening to mention a hind paw: "Oh," the bastard didn't shyly reveal his cockroaches and cockroaches. "Do you want to see it pee?" He proudly said: "I can fill the entire camp."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world looks at his brother without pity - not nominally, but in fact it seems that there is no good way to go where the brother to step back two steps, it remembers its place When someone often describes someone’s face as a knife and axe, it always feels that It will appear on the rough embryo of the marble statue, but it is found today that this adjective is still based on facts - it decided to pay a little sympathy, so patted the palm of the hand, the attention of the male lion and the beetle Force to attract yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We should go," said the dark-haired dragon. "Since you have finished your work - do you like roast lamb?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is more like this." The male lion body said, "Dear, come to my back, although there is no saddle, but I can guarantee I will never let you break that beautiful face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mittel has let go of the road, his look has restored the original calm, He looked at the male lion and the beast walking past him, his tail swaying, and the erected wings almost obscured the sky. It looked so powerful and powerful, and there was no cockroach that could be picked up. For the male lion body beast, it is in the prime of life - perhaps he doesn't know enough about it, he will accidentally irritate it, but it doesn't matter, they will have a long time to get along with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three days later, all the dragon knights, including you and me, must enter the military camp," Mitt said. "It’s time for them to meet the new commander of the dragon tooth." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That," said the soul of the alien world: "No problem." He said, stepping on the tail of the male lion's body, The male lion body beast is still six feet or seven feet high when it is under the body. The soul of the outside world is certainly not likely to move a ladder. It is ready for a floating operation, but the male face. The lion beast was just a glimpse of it, and he threw it on his back. His mane was very rich, and he suddenly drowned half of the dragon's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Re-conference." The soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Re-meeting." Mitt said that the male-faced lion body stood up and forced him to move backwards, then he walked quickly and briskly. Running, the last pair of wings flapped, and the body, which was as heavy as a hill, was sent to the heights of nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not fly directly to the kingdom, but hovered for a week on the camp. From the top to the bottom, you can see that the lion's lion is only very small. Part of the camp stayed in the camp, their owners are the captains of the Dragon's teeth, in order to have this privilege, the other knight's eagle lion and the lion's body are restricted to a hill just a few hundred feet from the camp. In the wind, there was a violent roar of screaming in the wind. The soul of the outside world gently patted the neck of the male lion and the beast, and said close to his ear: "You just said with Mitt. Remember?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men's lion body beasted and blinked, he recalled, because he was a little bit uncertain about what his new friend wanted to say. But he immediately thought of it - the dark face showed a smile that could indeed be described as evil: "Ah," he said softly, "I certainly remember."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
