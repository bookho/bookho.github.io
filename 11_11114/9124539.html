Of course, he can let Mitt like before. He spoke, but since then, people may be more willing to listen to Mitt's advice - even if the person concerned with him is him rather than Mitt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of thinking is short, short is like a light bursting in the darkness, he is arrogant and a little tired, but with the grid The Rinada people have to be gentle and have a lot of voices saying, "I remember you, Mullen, but when I saw you, you seemed to be a Norman in the Highlands."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mulren’s lips showed a smile: “Yes, Your Highness, I am still a Norman, but my mentor is working for Grenada, and I always follow and follow. Her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Gray Robe did not wait for Crimmar to move her hand over her shoulder and move her hand to the shoulder. She briefly nodded. She is not weak, but the black hair caster also has the identity of a dragon. Grenada has a saying that the most humble one is better than the most wise human. This sentence is not inscribed in the stone or On the copper strip, it is deeply imprinted in everyone's heart - the gray robes allow her to qualify for the majority of the dragons, but this is limited to the time when there is no conflict between them, not to mention that Cremari is still a The emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come to me," said Kremar. "I have something to ask you." He didn't ask Mullen at all, or The meaning of the mentor of Mullen - Ms. Gray Robe moved slightly, but she was patient. Mullen was only a disciple, not a Grinada. The request of the son of the Red Dragon did not threaten her magic and life. It is a very stupid thing for Mullen to make such a noble person unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being taken by a servant of Larry, all of them were not heard and seen except for one person behind Ms. Gray Robe. Go to this interesting episode, but I believe someone will take this as a fun piece of information in their memory - more precious and delicious food is sent up - first soft and tough pizza, wrapped in The cut meat is eaten together with the cut meat. You can pour lemon juice and honey. Of course, the deinonychus and the petrified lizards will not be eaten. Even the deer and goats will be abandoned. People only taste it a little. I tasted the meat of rabbits and pigeons; then there was a kind of watercress that grew only in dark and clear fresh water. I don’t know how many slaves would die in the underground waterway, but it’s really sweet to eat. Refreshing; glutinous rice, the soul of the outside world is the first time to eat rice, the rice of the Grenada is similar to the long grain fragrant rice of another plane, a bit hard, full of flavor, the mutton mixed with rice is so delicate tooth Do not need - if we Lich still awake, so he might be harsh reminder of this delicious little thieves, this can only come from those mutton lamb yet to be born. The butcher cut open the belly of the ewes that are about to give birth, and dragged the lamb out. These have grown the curls of the fur, but have not opened their eyes to see the cruel world, making a weak scream. The blood, milk and rice of the lamb and the ewe are cooked together and are the favorite staple food for the Grinada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blood wine, the blood of the pigeons is dropped into the wine glasses of every Grinada, whether the base wine is honey or ale, blood sweet The taste of the tongue has overwhelmed all the tastes that the tongue can taste. The soul of the outside world puts down the pure gold wine glass, perhaps because of the fact that he just returned to Grenada. Today's tableware is very common, even if it is Every one of them can be exchanged for one hundred and one thousand slaves on the black market, but there is no special embellishment from people and humans that the red robes like. Perhaps someone will be dissatisfied. But who is the owner here? It’s awkward Larry, of course he can’t make such a big leak in his banquet, after splitting a heart from a narwhal (each piece of flesh and blood sent to the guests is still beating painfully) He took out a small jar, to what extent, Larry's thick palm would completely wrap it, but when the lid was unscrewed, the red robe and the only gray The robe can't help but take a deep breath—a smell that all casters are familiar with and love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a damn old dog," Mitt said. "You still have snow honey." dudu1();<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The latest and all," Larry said: "I commissioned a thief, but it was a long time ago, when the silver crown jungle was not closed - I did not I thought that he could drag this simple task for so long, perhaps because he wanted to get more money - anyway, I didn't get the things I should have gotten until three days ago."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get it," Larry said. "Although he may not like it the way he gets it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are melting the gold coin into his throat "Another warlock said, "Is it still pressing the bag with gold coins on his chest?" His eyes sparkled with evil light, and the Grinada people were always interested in talking about this kind of thing. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be more similar to the former," Larry said. "If you like, we can appreciate my latest collection." He snapped his finger. The servants quickly moved the so-called latest collection, a statue that could be named pain and despair - the thief was fixed by magic or something, and the melted gold was poured from his head. As he went down, his flesh was melted by the hot gold solution. The solidified gold covered the skull. The eyes were in two slightly recessed caves. The mouth opened to the limit and the white reflection of the teeth was visible. The statue hangs on the upper body, and the lower part may be cut off because there is no need to keep it, but his hand - connected to the arms that are banned by gold, is still scratching like a worm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hands should be pretty, slender, well-defined, palms big, but now it seems that they are more like some kind of disgusting monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlocks talked about the spells needed for this statue, and some people tried to talk to Ms. Gray, after all, the soul is often The gray robes have a good hand, "It should be ... the application of the soul shackles," Ms. Gray robe said after careful observation: "It is not very complicated. If you must say it, the mage who casts this spell will imprison the soul of the thief." In this hand, so although he is dead, he can still feel and manipulate the hands," she cautiously not commenting, she can also cast this spell, but to modify and deform a spell means that the wizard at least Mastering a spell that is two levels higher than this spell, knowing the principles in it - Larry may not be able to invite such a powerful mage, but it is very likely that the caster is the disciple of the former, so he can learn this. A spell that has not been known by more people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The venerable mage said that this spell was not maintained for a long time," Larry said. "You think this despicable soul is still possible. To mourn the wasteland?"dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Gray robe quickly glanced at the statue, the hands were twisting their fingers, each stretched The tight skin and muscles are all about his pain. She didn't talk, just shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry immediately relaxed and looked even a little happy - he walked down from the seat and assigned each caster to become more precious now. Snow honey, Mitt and Kremar don't have to say that Ms. Gray is the only one of them, and other warlocks have got a copy that makes them feel good - complete satisfaction is impossible, red robe is born Greed, even if Larry dumps all the snow honey in a person's cup, it will not make him feel satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's take out the goods." A warlock and businessman suggested that they rushed back to take snow honey and meditation. Everyone agrees with this - the women and the cat-ear children who have been born in the wings have quietly retired, and the servants have only left a few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A warlock took a small bag of rice from his pocket, translucent rice, which was shorter than the rice of Grenada, but more Some obese, Larry and a few people chewed directly in their mouths, thinking that this rice can still be: "This is the rice of Serris," Larry asked: "How much?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock was a gesture, some merchants showed a surprised look, and the rice of Serris was quite rare on the market - their rulers did not use gold, but white rice as the whole country. The basis of this - this amount can not be obtained by small-scale smuggling, but in the black market, there is an invisible law that does not ask for the source of the goods, so they just wrote their own parchment after eyebrows The price you are willing to give - food is an extremely important material for every country and every region. No one will think that there is too much food. Although there are many places where rice is not a staple food, when you are hungry, who will pick this out? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlock took the parchment and looked at it one by one. Many people are willing to sell the goods to the highest price, but sometimes, maybe he prefers Exchange with some people, or sell someone to a person, but the warlock has made a decision, Larry became the selected buyer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a very good meter." One of the businessmen regrets that he is from a neighboring country, although he knows to trade with Grenada. It is tantamount to seeking a skin with the tiger, but he is not a king, nor a king's favorite. He has no right to change the decisions they make, not to mention that he can now be said to be half a Grenada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
