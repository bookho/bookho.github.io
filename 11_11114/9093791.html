The reason for this number is to avoid the situation where the last two issues are not met, so it is not too Allowing abstention in the final resolution is not right or wrong, very clear; if someone is sick, or if there is a critical sale, then he can pay a fine, then the assembly is postponed, and in general, no absence is allowed— - There was a member who went to the ruins of the wilderness before the General Assembly. As a result, his family not only needed to pay a fine but also to find a new spokesperson in just three days, not only the direct blood relative of the member, but also the adult. People, who have become citizens of Bituminburg for more than three years, have to pay an annuity of 10,000 gold coins, and the son of the member is only five years old. They have to sell the seat of this member to a new businessman. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new character is called Alex, a fur trader, and the citizenship of Bituminburg is exactly three years. It’s not that no one has ever vacated the seat of the parliament. It's a bit of a coincidence, but Yaris never reveals that even a star and a half are worthy of criticism. Although he likes women in a morbid manner, likes to eat too much, likes luxury clothes and jewelry, but also a generous and generous person, often invites tourmalines. The ordinary citizens of Dibao participated in his feast and enjoyed the singing or juggling of the bard. Sometimes, I said that at a certain festival, even the priests of Fro appeared at his banquet. This is enough for young people. The blood boils and makes him feel good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it is perceived that the Archon and Alva Master have been staring at him, and he has never played any unspeakable means in buying and selling, honestly The fur is sold from the north to the south, and then the southern salted fish and whale oil are carried to the north for sale, neither deducting the weight nor shoddy, nor delaying or refusing the payment, but the governor is always unable to Rest assured, according to his registrar's estimate, Alex's expenditure is almost equal to his profit. For a businessman, it is unbelievable to hide some gold coins in the library, but the problem is that This does not violate the law. This is his money. Of course he can decide how to use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, my dear friend." When Alex came into the chamber of the congress with a group of merchants, he could be said to be satisfied. The gray-black beard was repaired at the tip of the tip, wiped with beeswax and oil and then up. Tightly tilted up, it looks like an old goat wrapped in brocade fur, but his brain belongs to the fox, and the heart belongs to the lobster - black and cold, but the latter two are little known. After all, he has been disguised and disguised so far, but today, on this wonderful big day, you have to allow him to be a little frivolous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businessman who greeted him turned his head and looked at him. His eyes were cold, he was also an old man, and his hair had turned into pure silver. The hair dyed by Biarishi with magic potion is more natural and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be so cold." Yaris said sincerely: "I have never sinned you, respected Aubrey, but I hope that after you today You can change your mind. If you don't want your grand granddaughter to marry an ordinary fur trader," he even took out the silk embroidered handkerchief and rubbed his eyes: "So you can think about it, your grandson." How is the daughter married to the governor of Bituminburg?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Harvey has never asked me to marry me," Aubrey said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not talking about Harvey," Yaris pretended not to hear the words of Aubrey. "I, my dear friend, I said It’s me, the poor Harvey Archon is only... Let me see, probably half a day can continue to have this brilliant name, then he is just the most ordinary citizen, ok, maybe me I will pity him, although he has done a lot of stupid things, but I can let him be a soldier, standing by the gate of the city, and the daily salary will increase from two copper coins to three copper coins. After all, he can also be made for the tourmaline. A little bit of something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The things he dedicated to Betty's Fortress far exceeded your imagination!" Aubrey said angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It also hurts a lot, if you continue to let him be our consul." Alex said: "We will lose more."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those herbs are capable of destroying a person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, lie," Yaris scornfully Moved his short fingers, like a goat moving its feet ready to attack: "He just fears losing the power in his hands - he can always find the enemy," he patrolled around, can be said to use one A kind of compassionate look at those who continue to nod. "Not a pirate, a thief, or a so-called poisonous herb, but not all ports are like this? Especially a free port, look at the sharp Hong Kong, look at Grenada, we should accept everyone who wants freedom, their money bags, their messages, their ships, their goods - instead of rejecting this, and rejecting that The gods are on, we are just businessmen, not the ride of Tyre. We do not need fairness and justice, we only need gold, style yellow gold, do not you think my friends "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;!?! & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"That's right!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live freedom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get rid of the dictator ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We need more customers, more gold!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alix Smiling and raised his hands, rotated for a week, and gave a false swear to all those who supported him. "Thank you, my friend, thank you for the great and beloved Gredi. We can get rid of this full after today. A good person with a sense of justice, maybe he can go to the temple of Tell to see if he can find a job there, I think they will be willing to accommodate such an old guy, at least he can clean every Thai Pastor's toes - I think that he must be very skilled in the work..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up!" Aubrey shouted. You are blaspheming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Yaris pretended to panic. "What did I say?" He asked around "Is it cursing Tell? Or is it ruining Tell's followers? Ha, no, I don't," said the fur merchant, who was awkward and spread his hand: "I'm just worried about an old guy, no matter what." How do we say, we have known each other for a few years, although his perception of me does not seem to be very good. And when it comes to blasphemy... ah!" He suddenly yelled: "Don't you? You, you "You," he said with his fingers. "And with Haway, and Alva, at the Citizens' Congress, refused the priest of the goddess of honor to stand up in the Sanctuary and the Temple in Bibi Dyke. Is it true? Not you? Are you raising your hands? The bottomless abyss is down, how sad it is, you can't even understand what you have done!" Let everyone be shocked, Alex is as fierce as literally Jumped up and grabbed his own hair: "That is a powerful god, powerful, great, huge, big, big, grand, vast... you don't know at all, you are a group of unlucky lemmings, Front home What do you do, the guy behind you will do what you do, you don’t even know that you are going to jump off the cliff. - God, I can almost see your ending," he nodded with pity. "Your children will die." Then your wife and daughter-in-law, or daughter, will lose the ability to give birth. Even if the noble goddess is tolerant of allowing you to retain property, you can’t inherit their children. You will be alone in bed. "No one is saying goodbye, no one is willing to cook for you. It’s really sad." He shook his head desperately. "I can hardly imagine it..." But then, let everyone stunned, he actually stretched out Out of the tongue, made a face: "A group of idiots, but not worthy of sympathy. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was obviously very proud of his performance, while finishing his hair like a black satin, he laughed and rubbed his eyes at Aubry: "So," he said: "I won't If you take back your own proposal, you can hold the illusory hopes and promises until we get the final victory. When I become the consul, I will personally ask you to marry your granddaughter, don't worry. "He made a handicap and let Aubrey rush to mammoth his gesture (if it wasn't for the companion around Aubrey, he grabbed Aubrey's arm): "I don't want too much dowry, Auburn." Here, you are the leader of the Bibi Dibao Spice Fair, and I just want to add a little cargo to your caravan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those herbs, right "Aubrey said: "I won't agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Aubrey, old yak Aubrey, stinky stone Aubu ", Yaris has finished his hair, then he started to play with his coat and shook those stone buttons." I can't open my eyes: "For our businessmen, what can be more worthy of care than gold coins? Are you really planning to become a knight of Tell? No, dear, you are too old, even Tyre. Will want you, we will continue to believe in our Woking, of course, and the goddess of the Greinian - she is the protector of marriage and childbearing, if I have a marriage contract with your granddaughter, I have to be you The rudeness and blasphemy sacrificed a thousand cows and sheep to her, or a hundred slaves. What do you think? I got promised, although Aubrey, I am a little bigger than you, um, I I remember that ten years ago, I seemed to be sixty years old, but the priest of Greedy gave me the potion blessed by God. Aubrey, you don't have to worry that your granddaughter will squat, I promise she will be a year. I gave birth to a child next year..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people shouted loudly, this time Aubrey’s friend failed to grasp the old and strong Guild leader (perhaps deliberate negligence), he is like a fierce tiger To Yaris, the two old guys wrestled on the gorgeous carpet, some wanted to participate, some wanted to help, some wanted to open them, but no one succeeded until the current ruling of Bibi Tibao When the official Harvey arrived, his soldiers gathered all these plain-looking merchants from the ground one by one. This ridiculous war ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will get the results soon!" Yaris shouted. He opened his mouth with two missing teeth. It doesn't matter, he and Gray. The first pastor relationship is very "close" and he can get the best treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many of us are there?" Aubrey whispered when he was being helped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
