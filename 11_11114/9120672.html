The short sword is spinning in the air, nailed to the signboard of the Rose Inn, and the tail trembles with a slight humming sound. When the distance is so close, the smell of the monster is even more intense, and Ms. Rose can hardly breathe, but she jumps agilely to the side of the column, where a torch is lit, the torch is not here. The lords of the city set up for those who had to walk in the darkness - but the guards specially placed them to illuminate the corpse that was hanged on the blacksmith's signboard. It was both a warning and a threat. Will be hanged until the rot is exhausted, and the rope will fall when it can't be hanged. Before that, if you don't want to be put into prison by those guards, no one will put them down without permission.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if you are willing to give the guards a sum of money, you will find that the body is decaying very fast, and it’s gone overnight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it seems that the blacksmith has not been able to make enough money, the body is still hanging there, the tongue is spitting out, the eyes are raised, and the torch is swaying Under the light, he looks like he is staring at Ms. Rose in disgust. His death stems from his greed and ungratefulness, but this long-degraded soul does not think so, but Ms. Rose is in this city. From a baby in the shackles to this age, it is not a person who feels fearful because of this horrible scene. She jumps up and grabs the rope wrapped around the thin neck. **The feet stepped on the cold-curved arm of the deceased—the soldier did not tie his hands, and he struggled violently before dying. He had four fingers stuck in the rope, but nothing to save his life. effect<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, Ms. Rose violently rotated her body, no less than ten black burrs on the body of the fake thief, when belonging to an ordinary fly, This kind of bristles can hardly be seen with human eyes, but when they belong to a demon, each of them is like a small blow arrow. If it is not the stiff shield, it is Ms. Rose. Full of warm body, then she probably fainted because of the venom contained in the bristles<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Rose took the torch and waved it to the monster<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster unconsciously moved its furry legs slightly, the human female gasped, and she straightened her arm in an attempt to make the light and heat of the torch radiate even more Go within the scope<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster drives the eye, the compound eye consisting of countless small eyes, each eyeball is wet, its claws are constantly holding the ground, Like reluctantly wanting to retreat because of the intimidation of the fire, but at the moment when Ms. Rose slightly put her shoulder down, it swooped up, from its mouth, more correctly, in the mouthparts, squirting one The white pus is thick, and the pus is sprayed as far as twenty feet, and covers the size of two oak barrels - the torch is extinguished at once and is splashed by the pus. Ms. Rose only felt a sharp burning pain in her eyes, and the same sharp thing wiped her cheeks past and cut her high arm. She worked hard but fell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought she would fall on the stone road and had already predicted the pain that would surely come, but worse than that, she was a pair of paws Grabbed, the furry limb wiped her face and body, something smudged across her skin, if you want to describe it, it is like a rancid grease, but this kind of thing seems to be able to After neutralizing the previous mucus, she gasped for a few moments and opened her eyes. She saw a face that was difficult to describe with human words, but the hanging suede and the yellow-white hair floating in the air still let She remembered a person<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t know how the guard captain will look like this, but when the monster fixes her hands and feet with four paws, the other pair begins. When she ripped open the only linen robes on her body, Ms. Rose couldn’t help but shout loudly, but as she could think of and get used to, all the windows and doors were tightly closed, before The place where the light is on has also extinguished the candlelight. No one will be willing to help her. If this is just an outsider, maybe someone will try to see if she can get the honor to enter the room of Ms. Rose, but this is a monster. What it did before, you know that this big bug that crawls out of the bottomless abyss is definitely not a guard or a mercenary. Life is the premise of all pleasures and interests. Without it, nothing is nothing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If her brother is here tonight...not tomorrowMs. Rose knew that it was useless to think about it at these times, but when she heard the sound of her broken bones, she desperately pinned her last vitality in her illusion of being forced by a human being to live. But a monster, every inch of its skin is full of tiny barbs and spikes, seeping the festering pus, and in the bright moonlight, she can also see the dark limbs that are stretching and twisting. It looks like a couple of entangled tongues, and an arm that has an eyeball in the palm of your hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her body was opened, she closed her eyes, and now she even hopes to be killed immediately, but she knows that this may be a luxury - she is raptured Up, the shoulders pressed against the slate, the slate's cold and hard tormenting her flesh<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster is ready, it flaps its wings with full expectation, bends the body, now, as long as the tail is sent forward, its ** can Satisfied, its mouthparts are open, flowing with saliva - every bristles on it is shaking, the smell of fear and despair is so sweet, and the human body and soul are so crispy and delicious. Yes, there is yelling, and finally the most wonderful scream, full of hatred and pain, this is the most passionate movement of the devil and the devil - it must be heard, it can be heard, it is heard, but it The mind also ends at this moment<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Rose screamed, but not because of the monster’s torture, but because the monster’s head suddenly burst, the indescribable thick liquid and debris, The bristles spilled her, and the liquid burned her body like thin sulfuric acid, but the huge body dumped and grabbed her claws and let go, she dragged the broken arm from the pile Climbing out under the dirty and disgusting rubbish, when I looked up, I saw that the window on the far right side of the second floor was standing alone. The darkness made his hair and body part of the shadow, but his face was like Moonlight emits a soft glow<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me!" Ms. Rose shouted, "Help me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ———————————————————————————————————————————————— —————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Rose is naturally grateful to her benefactor. She not only promised a lot of compensation, but also said that she can get a strong red robe as long as her brother returns.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you use to kill the monster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gnome's bursting arrow"The soul of the opposite world replied that while showing the woman's bow to the woman, although he cast a spell instead of a gnome, but since Austal did not even reveal his red robe... the role of the spell is The powerful physical force makes the enemy's head burst, and the bursting of the arrow is the same. Even if the caster comes over, it may not be able to come up with other answers - mainly the head of the monster is too deformed, after the burst Like a bunch of post-modern installation art that can be named the will of the great universe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Rose smiled reluctantly, she was holding a glass of ale, she had already drunk a lot of cups before, but the smell and touch that made her go crazy Still can't go<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she has almost lost the power of climbing - not to mention that the wall is already faltering, the front door of the pub is open, still from the open gap You can see the body of the monster. It has shrunk in a short time, showing a bad prototype. The lich has seen the losers who can't get out of this change potion. Generally it is not a potion. The problem in the manufacturing process is that the user's willpower is too weak, but now it seems that both conditions are there. At least the change potion that he configured before will not create such a seemingly powerful and weak body.Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does Ms Rose want to say? At the time, a loud shout came from the street.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discovering that his precious change potion suddenly disappeared, the sharp nose warlock had already felt ominous, he hurriedly, almost unnecessarily cast a spell to Looking for your fatherThe direction of the spell's direction didn't surprise him. He could say that he was coming at the fastest speed. He only thought about the potion at first, because his father's deception and short-sightedness were raging, anyway, that A bottle of syrup can be used only when he feels very critical, and it is not used by his father, or anyone other than him, and his father is afraid of being a human female. Lost land to use it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will no longer be able to serve a succubus, nor have the courage and material to summon a succubus, he can no longer make such a useful The potion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short journey, his brain is spinning fast, he expects his father to just show the potion to show off or intimidate, but he can sniff To that special smell, I saw that the huge body is obviously not a personal body, so he thought that it might be possible to fix this form and then conquer it, just like to conquer the magic pet, let it become its own tool and The pet, like the mentor of the Warlock Tower - but before he ran to the body, he found it dead, thoroughly<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the alienation on the body is disappearing, he is at least a warlock, knowing that this situation means that it will soon shrink and restore<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned down and/or hurriedly put away some blood, thick pulp and hair, but did not wait for him to use the third small glass bottle. Lying in front of him is no longer a valuable monster, but a human being without a head, aging and uselessness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its head is no longer there, the neck is bloody, the body is not covered, the skin is full of scratchesBut there was a scar on his thigh, and his nose recognized the scar. His father used to be a mercenary. He fled in a battle and then looted the belongings of those unfortunate compatriots without any guilt. And it became a businessman. This scar was left in the battle, but it was not the enemy, but a former companion. When the father of the nose nose pulled his leather bag, he actually could bite. The last breath gave this despicable person a dagger<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father of the sharp nose certainly does not think that he is a wicked person. If the property is not taken away by him, it is not a pity to stay in the wilderness and sink into the mud. He often makes his nose look at his legs so that he can remember to be cautious whenever he wantsThe sharp nose recalled this thing, could not help but feel a trace of sadness, this sadness made him shed a tear<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Rose was forced to pull, the burning flame long tongue from her Wiping behind her, she stinked her hair, and she fell to the ground, rolling, she had already changed a clean dress, but in order to rinse off the mucus, she eagerly used the wine. So all her wet hair is full of wine - the only thing to be grateful is that the ale and cider are very inferior and the wine is very light. If it is winter wine or rum, she may have burned now.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw the man after the fire, he wore a red robe that would make everyone kneel, the heat of the flames hit him, let the robe and the robes Crazy flying in the dark background<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face is still so ugly and ridiculous, but Ms. Rose can’t smile at all, she saw him raise his hands – a warlock raised his hands What else can I do? She was hiding behind a table, but the table was immediately opened by an invisible hand, and the wall fell to the ground - she was shown in front of the pointed nose, his expression was so embarrassing, "I don't Will make you die so happilyHe said sullenly: "I promise"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But why! ? "Ms. Rose shouted: "I don't understand what you are saying! There is no hatred between me and you! She even wants to say that if he didn't have a father who was too ugly and too old, she might be his new mother now, but she can only pin her hopes on the perpetrator of this persuasion... convince him of her. I don't know that the monster is his father.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You killed my father"The pointed nose said: "The one outside the door.""The last use of the bottle of remedy<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," Ms. Rose said: "It has no resemblance to your father.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the relationship?""The nose is violently said: "Even without this, I want to kill you. Do you have to find more than three pieces of evidence, twelve witnesses and rumors listening to the defenders?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think about my brother! Ms. Rose shouted, she was not the caster, but she could still feel the pressure from the thin hands: "A red robe," she said with a slight smugness: "The same red as you." Robe, "maybe stronger than you: "I know that you always want to get the call of the Warlock Tower," she said. "Maybe my brother will be willing to help you. He told me that his mentor is also Your tutor, I like him very much, and often give him some important things to do.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave a sigh of relief - the sharp-nosed warlock's eyes were erratic, but he did gently put down his raised hands and turned them into his sleeves. He seemed to think seriously for a moment: "Listen. It seems good"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A fairly cost-effective saleMs. Rose said straightforwardly: "I swear to Greed, this is really just a misunderstanding, an accident, I feel very sorry about it - but I have absolutely no intention of disrespecting or unfavorable to you, I swear, wait." My brother is back, just today, I think he will give you compensation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right," said the nose, he seems to have Persuaded by Ms. Rose, but standing in the corner watching their alien souls not so unexpectedly searched for the malicious and ridiculous in those small eyes, "The problem is," the sharp nose continued: "I don't think What compensation can a dead person give me! When he said the last word, he almost screamed, and his hand slammed out of the pocket, as black objects were thrown out of his big fingers and squatted in the rose. On the nose of the lady, she gave a painful cry, accompanied by a sharp nose warlock laughing.Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look!" he shouted: "Look, this is your brother, dear brother, yes, he is indeed back. It’s a pity that there is only such a thing!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like an irritated cock that raises his feathers. “You should thank me, Ms. Rose! Otherwise, your brother won’t even come back to this part!” He could hardly believe when he got this good news. He paid this after he paid more, although he knew that this part might be a warlock dispatch apprentice. Pulled out of the little monster's mouth, but fortunately, most of it is well preserved, and it can be done in good condition to confirm that his biggest enemy is absolutely impossible to win from him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing can be said to be more than half of the head, the brain is a very important experimental material, it was dug away in the morning, and the residual traces can be seen The part was saved by the spell, probably because it was a very handsome face. It was kept as an ornament for a few days before being thrown to the little monster responsible for cleaning up the garbage.The pointed nose did not know whether Ms. Rose had received the message because she was deceived or because his brother was still alive and foolishly thought that he was valued, mostly the latter. In the Warlock Tower, the distance between life and death is often Only a distance between the scrolls and the paper, even their tutors may be swallowed when they summon the devil, or they may be killed by the ghosts sent by the enemy. His disciples are no more than that, not to mention Another name for disciples and apprentices in the Warlock Tower is a sacrifice or an experimental product.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also was uneasy because the boy had been favored by his mentor for more than a decade. Now it seems that "value" does, but what is it? It’s hard to say what you value<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Rose gave a slight glimpse, she couldn’t understand the sharp nose, but she climbed over the next limb and will be the only one. The head that was smacked to one side was held in his arms, and the flame ignited the threshold and the tables and chairs. Their light was enough to make Ms. Rose see the face that was not very familiar, but who else could have such a face? ? And the attitude of the pointed nose has already explained this. Ms. Rose is like a man in a small town. They are familiar with each other. Ms. Rose knows that her nose is like a father. She is a bully, shameless and shameless villain. When they face the strong, they will only be flattering and charming, unless they are threatened by life, otherwise they will not dare to confront the latter anyway - don't say how deep the emotions between them, no one does not know After the sharp nose came back from the Warlock Tower, he and his father’s status fell. Countless people saw him yelling at his father like an old dog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her brother also said that the position of the pointed nose in the Warlock Tower may be higher than the little monsters that deal with garbage, and some apprentices even secretly He described it as a human mud monster, of course, not that he is as strong as a mud-shaped monster, but that he can not humiliate like a muddy monster, ridicule, and does not mind being left behind in the corner of no one cares. But her brother also said that the sharp nose also has his wisdom, and she is vigilant. In any case, he finally walked out of the Warlock Tower, and how many apprentices who once mocked the guy they thought was useless and ridiculous. And disciples, there is no chance at all to touch the red robe they dreamed of.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Ms. Rose did not think that her brother is one of them. He is so clever and talented. He is also a tutor and other disciples. That kind of humility and meekness... she can't believe it, maybe this is just a nightmare? But she knows she must wake up<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you already remembered it?" The nose was not so satisfied, and twisted his fingers: "Let's finish the work... my I am in a hurry and need your scream to calm down - Dear Ms. Rose, I will handle your soul properly, maybe you will share a jewel with my father? As a son, his wishes I am always willing to meet one or two"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to raise his hand, but before he casts the spell, Ms. Rose’s yelling stopped him and revealed a confused look: what are you saying? "he asks<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your father is not killing me!" Ms. Rose shouted: "Not me, not that I killed your father!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nose is over the head: "Who is that?" He took a sniff: "Don't tell me that he was on the road and accidentally fell and gave his head to him." Fell"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is this personMs. Rose said that she pointed to the person who had been standing in the corner. This person’s nose was found early, but he never cared about a mortal. If he wanted to block himself, the sharp nose would certainly not smash a fireball. Or after he gets the soul of Ms. Rose, he can also add a small dessert to the feast of revenge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is he a caster?" asked his nose, but he didn't think it was very similar. The person looked very ordinary, except for being extraordinarily calm, but It is also possible that he is already scared."A mortal can't kill my father.After drinking the changing potion, he knew exactly what the user would look like. The nose was initially thought that Ms. Rose might have some magical equipment, since she always said that her brother loved her very much, and her The younger brother is deeply loved by the tutor, then she may have something to kill a demon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Ms. Rose said dryly: "But he has a bow and a bursting arrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gnome's bursting arrow," said the pointed nose: "That is possible."He made a gesture, if the mortal raised his hands or made some other moves, he would immediately be torn by the sharp nose.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that person just looked at Ms. Rose, the fire reflected in his dark eyes, Ms. Rose first lowered her eyes, then raised her eyes again, she was sorry But she has no brother, she can't lose herself. She doesn't know if her nose will be willing to forgive herself after killing this person, but if she doesn't say anything, then she will be tortured to death without a doubt. The soul still can't get peace after death.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think he wants to save a poor girl," said the sharp-nosed nose: "Like a poet who praises poetry in poetry."”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
