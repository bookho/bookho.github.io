			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the convenience, there are of course other things that make Baldwin shine like a statue of the same Mithril. That kind of "chromogen" (should be the word, as a former paladin, Birdwin thinks that every word spoken by the Master and the Gnomes is so profound and incomprehensible) insoluble in stomach acid, insoluble In the blood, it is not soluble in other body fluids, and the two ghosts that are not in the elegant hall are removed. It is more directly pulled out from the body, and fine particles are condensed on the skin, just like the rock powder. The granules, when Bydwin raised his hand and prepared to remove a coke from the silver plate, his fingers and the crystal pot inlaid with gold rims reflected each other, according to Mei Mi, when he was in the sun. It’s like the incarnation of Rosada came directly to this plane, um, quite, it’s hard to see the bright light until now, her eyes are still very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, without her excessive description, Baldwin also knows what he is, and he wonders if the developer is really mixed with rock powder. But this idea was immediately vetoed by himself. One of the assassination methods he knew was to crush the stone and mix the broken powder in the food for the victim to eat, so that the rock powder would stick to the stomach. On the inner wall of the intestine, with each creep of the muscles, their sharp cuts will slowly smash the blood of the tender internal organs. The victim will vomit blood continuously, and can't eat anything, and it is extremely painful. Some less experienced priests tend to cast a powerful treatment, but the treatment only seals the stone in the muscles of the stomach. Over time, it will wear through the stomach and the intestines, causing more damage. And torture, so people who know the yin and private will go looking for a red robe. The red robe can cut the victim's stomach and intestines, extract the stone powder, and then suture all the layers of the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in order to save the life of such a mortal person, the price of the red robe will be high, but fortunately it can be invaded by this expensive poison. Poor worms are almost all prominent people. Birdwin has heard from the old king that an uncle of the latter has been lost a quarter of the hard stone powder mixed in his favorite skylark pie. In the stomach, when the powder of the stone is too fine, too much or too wide, the red robes will almost always choose this method that is simpler and faster for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I think about it, although I don’t think there will be any harm to his composition in this developer, Birdwin is still rare and gentle. And wrapped in his fingers with silk, this way will only be used by some gentle, cherished women, or when she must pretend to be like this, such as the king of Norman Leona has been away from Wang Ting since she left, and she has never used her meal in this way. On the contrary, although she is elegant, she still carries a few extra points that belong to the ranger or the warrior. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the priest of Fro, the nectar will certainly not do that. She prefers to lick her fingers slowly during the meal. Fro's priest can make this action similar to 猥亵 very beautiful and strong. Seductive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry was curiously reaching out and rubbing Baldwin’s skin. "What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gnomes do...a potion," Birdwin said. "Used to observe my blood vessels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone Said that it is not clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long will this situation last?" asked Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar said that on the third day they will be excluded." Baldwin shook his head and said, squinting, Crema I asked for a potion from the gnome. I dripped it in my eyes and applied it to my lips and tongue. This potion can decompose this developer very well, but the existing amount is too small, so I can only take care of it first. These sensitive and important places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak up," said Gülen, "What about our mage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gnomes I called him away early, as if to discuss some very important things," Kerry said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;※※※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world once felt that the gnomes were like another plane The scientist in the middle, now his feelings are stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnomes submitted a series of requests, and the complicated and complicated ones are not to be said for a while, but let the souls of the outside world ask for the equipment and devices they asked for. It reminds the lab and the operating room that the gnomes have listed them as a detailed list of the form, with the drawings on the back of each instrument (they actually have three-dimensional drawings!), and the smallest size is not missing. According to McGee, this is just a basic tool, and these patterns only give their gold lord, that is, Crimmar a more intuitive understanding. The key to the real importance is in the mind of every gnome. It was the spellcaster of the secret black hair that they would defend with life, flipping through the parchment in their hands, and he stopped on one. McGee picked up his toes and groaned. "What?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piece of parchment is a long, well-structured spring rod with a pea-sized spoon at the end of the pole. The scribe has indicated that the instrument can be bent at will: " What is this?” The soul of the alien world asked, he felt that such things seemed to have been seen somewhere, although not so subtle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The marrow-clearing device." McGee said, he used gnome, and then he repeated it in GM with the dark eyes. once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don’t think Baldwin can use this," said the soul of the alien world. The calm and steady tone does not reveal that he has at most two. One of the points: "He just needs a prosthetic, not... it needs to fill the brain, although in many people's perceptions, the soldiers are really lacking in this area."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McKe licked his beard, which is one of the tricks that gnomes often play, when you hold a piece of secret silver or fine gold, or even just a piece of pure steel to give the gnomes what to build When you first, you must determine with him how much weight you need to make. Then you must remind him that he or she will re-calculate the weapon after the weapon or armor is completed. Otherwise, they will dig a large piece from your raw materials and tell you that the material is not enough or simply take other materials. Filled up, perhaps for this reason, the creation of gnomes is always difficult to get people's trust, if it is not too difficult for the dwarves to deal with, they are now afraid of not so proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of McGee are not stupid enough to move the material or material in front of a caster, but this does not prevent them from continuing to the post. You can add something that Birdwell doesn't need from the top of the creek's head to the heel's list, but they need it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-eyed caster picked up the quill on the side, smashed it in the ink mixed with lapis lazuli, and crossed the list of utensils. One line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world, together with the lich in his body, found a lot of things that were not needed from the list, like a scale, Mai Base insists that it is used to weigh the weight of the parts, but in fact it has a maximum limit of one thousand pounds. Whether it is the lich in the body or the soul of the outside world, it does not feel that Birdwin needs to wear it. A thing that weighs a thousand pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think they are going to do with this scale? Weighing a whale? The soul of the alien world is said to be like a teacup heating pad when it looks like a teacup heating pad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the fine gold, the Lich said, look at its size, it is clear that it is impossible to compress so much weight in such a size without the use of fine gold casting... and so on! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How, is this a problem? The feather pen held by the alien soul stayed on the small line, and he could feel the McGee around him suddenly nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a must!" gnome shouted, "Everything inside is a must!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;No problem, once the undead said, just, this tool allows them to build two sets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the Lich said, you should not forget that in addition to Birdwin’s right hand, we still have an important thing to do for those “tobacco”. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DaDa hasn’t already taken out some of the “tobacco” and secret medicines we need? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is on the one hand, the former undead patiently explained that we still need to explore the slaves who took the "tobacco" and I need to understand them in detail. Every part of the body... Those who are different from ordinary people, he paused a little, you should understand, he said, in your plane, your...the pastor will do the same, this is not for sacrifice Or what evil purpose is reached...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to dissect them, the soul of the opposite world says that he looks at the tools again, they seem to have a few Familiar with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the living? No, the lich said earnestly, I can't do evil, right? You know this very well, all I need is a body that is no longer needed by their owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world hesitated for a while, then played a symbol that the lich did not understand after the few lines, but the lich knew that he agreed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they don’t meet Elf Kerryburn so quickly, the Lich will not discard the instruments he cherishes, but unfortunately he must When I walked with Kerry, the strength was so weak that it was difficult to escape from the elf's bow and arrow. The former undead had to throw all the precision instruments made of Mithril into the sea outside Bibi Dibao. Those instruments are ten times more elaborate than the gnomes, and ten times more evil (after all, gnomes rarely appear in the gray robes that deal with the last property left by the dead), but if they are rich in adventures, The elf with deep knowledge saw that every word that the lich had said before would be questioned. After all, there was only a stranger with only a trace of blood between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it’s out of emotions or out of practice, the Lich will need them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Chiri moved to the highest point, Krimaar’s conversation with the gnomes finally came to an end, and the list was reduced to the original one-third. The gnomes muttered dissatisfaction, but only expressed dissatisfaction. They could still get a lot of secret silver and gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, McGee’s idea is indeed more exciting than the original ideas of other gnomes and lichs. “Have you heard of the Silver Golem?” Base said that the gnomes heard the words immediately widened their eyes, and the souls of the outside world could even see the burning fire of knowledge burning from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Few people know now." McGee said: "Even before the catastrophe, only a handful of mages have had this kind of golem." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a gesture, "The kind of golem is made of Mithril, it's not unusual, although Mithril is really expensive, but making a silver magic The Mithril like is not an ordinary Mithril. They are actually a ball that is difficult to distinguish even if it is an elf. Each bead contains a fine crystal like dust. These crystals can be combined with one. A magical gem produces resonance, I mean, the core of magic, do you understand? The general gem has only fifty parts, the magic gem is both their core and their source of power, and the silver golem The magic core echoes tens of thousands of Mithril particles, which are tiny, tiny enough to flow like water, and can be combined into a variety of shapes depending on the owner's wishes or the enemies they face. They are not afraid of fire, strong acid, and will not be rocked with Ground burial, violent freezing also take them helpless, they can pass through the gap that only a small finger can pass through, can also expand into a huge barrier like a wall, they can shrink themselves, become themselves like a gnome fist Small, can also make themselves as big as a giant, they can be bows and arrows, they can also be shields, they can also be curved swords, they are wide swords, as long as you can think of things, they are within the scope of their changes, and Because of this, it can become very subtle. When you need it, you can use it as a belt around your waist. You can also throw it out. It will be like the most awkward puppy. I ran back silently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world took a sigh of relief. "It sounds really good."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
