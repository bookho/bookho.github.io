			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen reveals a depressed smile, she seems to want to say something, but the little devil suddenly raised his body and put his two paws on the chest before. This is not a good agreement. They don't trust each other, but even a mortal can know that it is not a threat or atrocities that follows this action. She immediately put down the honey, tidy up the hair accessories and clothes, and at the same time turned to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Demon rudely slammed the door and walked in, he saw a gentle and lovely little wife, and the little pet that was finally tamed by him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After getting the so-called real name, he imposed many restrictions on Asmodeos, including not allowing it to be used without the owner’s permission. He was born with all sorts of weird abilities, he would rather not play the huge role it should have played - just as he did not make a covenant with a little devil, Asmodeos only said lingua franca, long Like the hamsters of the wings - the lame caster even got a custom-made thin collar to force the little devil to hang around his neck. The collar is pigskin, and a copper coin-sized pendant hangs underneath. The smooth surface of the sinker is engraved with Demon. The name, with a little magic attached to it, if the little devil arrives at some time while his real master (Demon proudly claims) to summon him, the collar will tighten and tighten its neck until Le It’s off, and this time is set by Demon himself, and often changes or orders the little devil to fly to a far away place to do things, seeing Asmodeos flapping his wings and swaying from afar When he comes, he will be happy. To laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome back, my dear master." An Zhen said softly, while lowering his knees, and Asmodeos erected His own sharp and long black membrane wing, yelling at him, although visually, just a ball is more rounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you get along well." Demon said as if he had no intention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Asmodeos is very cute." An Zhen said, took the velvet robes he took off, and the robes were adorned with fur on the black squat legs. The fur there was too warm for the weather in April and May. But since Demon became the owner of the White Tower and the Hill, he became more and more swaying—perhaps with his discovery that he was only a cockroach controlled by the guild, and he barely touched his spell book. Not all the fun of the priests of Fro was gluttony and alcoholism all day long; he walked two steps lazily and tiredly wanted to sit down right away - sitting in a soft chair sitting before Anzhen. Instead of the luxury seat that is exclusive to him, inlaid with Mithril jewels, as he immediately reached for the jug, he made this choice mostly because he was interested in the storage of the crystal jug. Honey wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon didn't take the cup. He grabbed the slender neck of the jug and tilted it to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy jug shook his hand. The honey spilled from his lips, moistened the woolen robe and the silk ** - his hand kept shaking, even if he put down the hip flask, even if the ampoule is not a caster, she also Knowing that as a mage Demon is over, her father often interacts with different mages, and before the mother of Anzhen leaves forever, Antonio Master is like a member of their family - Antonio Mage occasionally drinks Ordering wine allows you to concentrate better and get into the state of absence before you cast the spell as quickly as possible, but like Demon. Unscrupulously toasting the caster in the morning or at night, Anzhen doubts if he can make a correct spelling gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She calmly watched Demon drink her wine, "Go get some wine," Demon said: "winter or rot "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry, but you just drank the last bit of honey," said An Zhen. "The White Tower has no winter wine or sweet." When the wine is gone, the merchants are uneasy and unwilling to go out to do business, because as long as their guards leave with them, their property will be stolen. The wife and the daughter will also be insulted, and even the house will be burned. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon thought with a puzzled thought, and stupidly patted the arm of the chair and laughed: "Oh, Mask is on." He cursedly Say: "They are a group of people who have been spoiled by the elves. Now there are no traces of thieves' guilds in those cities. Other merchants can pay taxes to thieves, get their protection, and be safe. Doing your own business, why can't they?" He made a face: "They have been sinned and suffered. It is their own The problem - they are too embarrassed, they are not willing to pick up a few gold coins from their pockets, don't blame others for cutting their throats and taking all the money from their skins."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are almost ready to go bankrupt," said An Zhen. "The thieves want all their money and drive them away. Demon, do you know that there are people?" Take their caravan from them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon smirked unhappyly, he really didn't know, he hadn't been in power for a long time The official's official residence, even if he went, was only because the consul's room was a very special place for fun--especially when he thought of his stereotyped, ruthless father who had worked there, he really wished a master to It is a wonderful thing to recall him on the wasteland and let him see the present scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like this important thing, he has neither the right to speak nor the right to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon had prepared for the heavy crystal jug when he came over, she escaped, but what happened after that almost let her send Madness - Demon grabbed him and the children of An Zhen from the cradle and made a move to throw her at her mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Connected! Ampoule," he muttered. "Otherwise you may have to regenerate one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment he took off his hand, the child fell in the cradle, unscathed, Demon face down on the ground, Anzhen stepped on him and he did not say anything, An Zhen picked up the child, Back to the arms of familiarity, the child began to cry, but not too loud - he was as smart as An Zhen said, or perhaps related to his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodais squats on the edge of the cradle and licks his tail: "Don't thank me so much," he said slyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do he find out?" asked An Zhen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said the little devil. "He only remembers that he accidentally fell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must have let him fall a lot," said An Zhen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so often," the little devil chewed his tail: "I am a cute little pet."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't let him die," said An Zhen. "We haven't had the strength to cope with the guild."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time will not But I think he is getting more and more annoying," said the little devil. "I am too lazy to deal with him again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you are not leaving now His power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If not, why should I talk to you here?" The guests of the bottomless abyss violently jumped into the cradle and pulled up The small blanket pretends to be a baby, fantasizing that there will be a stupid human woman close to the cradle. He bit his nose when he leaned over and wanted to pick up his child: "Did you not think about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can't you replace Demon? I mean, now, not like you and the stubborn white robes and the Masters have agreed for a long time. Later?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand," An Zhen frowned. "My son is still in the middle of it, and we have not been able to prepare enough to fight against the guild - except that it is called fine mesh, we don't know anything about it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil made a creepy laugh: "I am not an elf, nor a priest of Rosada and an Antonio mage, an ampoule. In front of me, you don't need to bring that symbol. Stupid and innocent mask - I have always only talked to smart people, so don't pretend that I can't understand me, I mean - you can replace Demon and become the spokesperson of 'fine net' in Baita and Lushan "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anzhen holding the child, the tapestry of the window is open, the light of the stars and the dark blue light illuminate her face, making her look It is like a statue of white tin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have served a number of wizards and warlocks," Asmodeos said to himself. "There are many people who work for the huge thieves' union, and some have become important members of the guild and even the leader, so I know their tricks well - yes, they need a knack, but that cockroach can't be too bad, just Like Demon, my poor master, he is almost rotted into a pile of mud - so how can he complete the work that the guild might hand over to him... He consumes the guild's gold coins and women, which makes people I can't stand it, I think their patience is going to be the limit. It's a good opportunity, my mistress, it's a rare event."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Ampoule," It continues: "Why are you taking risks? Don't say that future wars with the guild will cause you and your child's death. Don't deny that it is almost inevitable, they love to take the weakness of others and find them happy. Maybe you won't kill your child, but send it or sell it to a red robe, you know. (Ahn has taken a step back and grabbed it.) The red robes are always a little weird. No, not only the body, but also the soul, the pure soul of the child is one of the most favored goods of the gray robe - well, even if we don't have to think so long, even now, my mistress, Demon also It has already threatened you and your child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asmodeos stretched out his tail and picked up the abandoned glass, knocked it off The last bit of wine inside, "You humans have a saying that is right, don't wait for the milk to overturn and cry again, of course, if you insist on being patient, Demon will drop your child from the window of the tower and come back. Action, I have no opinion, the devil is immortal - I just want to remind you, in addition, standing on the human stand, I think that if you become a member of the fine net, it is much better than Demon. You have a beautiful appearance that no one else can match, a noble bloodline, a bright mind, I believe that you will get a high position in the guild that Demon is hard to touch in this life - then, you want to do something for the white tower Nothing will be difficult - You can control and manage the members of the guild, you can specify the taxes that merchants need to hand over to the guild, or they can try to allow them to redeem their caravans. You can even rebuild their houses and give them back. If you can get enough gold coins for the guild, they won't care about this little detail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
