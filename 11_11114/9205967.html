			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo. De. Medici stands in front of everyone. As the leader of the "Brotherhood" in Florence, the Medici parents have the right to receive the first Eucharist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dress is as solemn and solemn as ever, black velvet tights, pants, embroidered with the same color coat without jewels, gold necklace with cross and so on It is better to say that it is a necessity; but that luxurious cloak should be enough to make up for the above shortcomings. It belongs to the predecessor of the Medici, the raw materials come from carefully selected Garbo wool, which is dyed into a thick and even dark red by the three most expensive oriental dyes, and then spun into wool thread, and countless naked eyes. The unrecognizable gold thin-line mixed silk thread is woven into a block fabric, and finally hand-stitched into a garment, a velvet lining, and a squirrel-skin edging, which is thick and strong enough to exceed the imagination. When Juliano was a child, he also stood upright out of the air as the main tent in the war game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current parents of Medici have immediately cast a warning and a urging glimpse when they see their brother appear outside the church door. But the church was empty, dark and cold, only slightly stopped, and Giuliano's legs twitched like a reflex. He showed a poor smile on his brother's style and shook his head. He is not a parent of the Medici family. It doesn't matter when he leads the Eucharist. He prefers to sunbathe by the gate of the church. And Park and his friends seem to think this way, three young people crowded into a pile at the church door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo lifted his lips in dissatisfaction and helplessly, when the main sacrifice and the people waited for each other, he turned and went to Girola in Perugia. The scorpion of the Count of Mo, the Cardinal Rafaelo di Riorio, talked for a while and it seems that he is explaining for Giuliano - well known, this prominent young man is against the Medici family. The second son has always had a lot of curiosity - after he returned to his original position, he lowered his eyes and concentrated on the silent prayer of repentance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading the Bible (the Hadith of God), people answer "Amen"; reading the Bible, reading the Bible, people answer "We praise you."; preaching; reading the confession; Prayer; dedication ...... The sacred ritual that was originally dull enough to appear longer because of the excessive use of the ruthless church Latin, a considerable number of people soon began to fight, talk about business and gossip, although their disrespectful behavior It is always interrupted by the hunger of the stomach... Until the afternoon, the acopheres are successively sent to the cakes and wines that will become the Holy Blood. After repeating a series of boring but necessary steps, such as fragrant incense, consecration, rites, reading, singing, etc., people who have been fasting according to the canon in the last night are involuntarily eagerly watching the main sacrifice high in the silver. The gray face in the sacred box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliano rolled his tongue out of control and made a contemptuous face. Every time the Eucharist eats like a brown rice cake soaked in vinegar, the young man doubts more than once, and the fasting of the whole night before the reception of the Eucharist is not for the purpose of swallowing this difficult thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two deacons walked to the side of the main sacrifice, holding the holy The sacred blood of the blood and the sacred body of the Eucharist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliano raised his hands, crossed his fingers, clenched his fists in his jaw, closed his eyes, and began to mutter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels beside him, it should be that Bernardo Bandini’s people are wriggling uneasy, as if who poured a whole lot of fleas on him. If not in the church, Giuliano might choose to throw him out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo lowered his head and mourned the scriptures in his mouth, he was The bench squats under the knee to greet the Eucharist - but before that, a savage slender flash swept over the edge of his field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vigilant claws suddenly caught Lorenzo’s heart, and the instinct drove him to turn around in a semi-squatting posture without warning - attempting to stab The knife that wore his neck and the hand that grabbed his shoulders all fell, and Medici’s eldest son thought innocently. He fell to the rear, rolled over on the ground, knocked over the ceremonial table on the right, and yelled angrily: Murder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliano was angry and frightened in the cry of his elder brother The last sight of the light brown iris is the high-profile slaughtering knife in the hands of Bernardo Bandini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bendini’s strength is great, and the butcher’s livelihood tools are as straightforward as the real weapon into the forehead of the Medici’s second son; at the same time, the young Pach grip on the other side of the victim. Tightly pulled out the small left-handed sword from the sleeves, like the zebra's hyena, fiercely grabbed Giuliano's back, he stabbed and stabbed without stopping - in Bernardo. Bendini confirmed Giuliano's death, and then carefully awakened the number of times the left-handed sword penetrated enough to make a large sieve for macaroni before being nervous or excited to completely control his friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pach stood up in dizziness, and the hot red liquid soaked in the light velvet, except for Giuliano, the blood of this poor victim. And his own - the murderer who inadvertently created a slender wound on his lap is still driven by intense emotions and rich fantasies, temporarily feeling too much pain, his face muscles twisted, teeth biting It creaked, looking like a vulture after a bloody vag, looking around, looking for the second goal of today in a chaotic crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medic's suites and friends rushed to the altar, but the assassins in the crowd greeted them. In front of the marble altar, Lorenzo faced three despicable murderers alone: ​​one was the main sacrifice, he grabbed the jewel-filled silver sacred box as a defense, and the other hand unskilledly grasped a wide The daggers were nervous; the assistants who had thrown away the ritual supplies served as the principal offenders. They were tall and tall, and the five senses under the headscarf were rough and rough. The position of holding the left hand and the short knife was very similar. Lorenzo remembered it. One of them is the martial arts teacher of the Pach family. In a certain field, there was a brief conflict with Juliano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo wants to find his brother, but the assassins have apparently recovered from the beginning of their failure, they fiercely rush to Medici Parents, the arms are shining in the candlelight, eager for the noble blood; the unarmed murderer has to wave the cloak and let it wrap around the arm, showing that the cloak of luxury and identity is always heavy and inconvenient. Now it has become the best substitute for shields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people near the altar screamed, some brave people pulled out their weapons, more people desperately wanted to escape, and the people behind them I can't figure out what happened, curious and desperate to fight forward, and Mingzhe's full strength to retreat, and the scene was chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo and the murderer’s fight are still going on. When I used the feather pen and the holy kettle’s hand to wield the weapon, it would be awkward and naturally beautiful. Dijon became the best breakthrough. A jug was kicked by him, and the sacred body cloth that was dropped in the panic wrapped around the feet of the gods. The latter screamed and fell backwards. He overturned the high iron frame and the reading platform where the candles were placed. The candle on the shelf flew out, but fortunately it fell on the damp and cold marble floor, and only a small part of it ignited a little silk hanging on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire is annihilated, at this time only the pale golden sunlight from the rose window is empty for the cathedral lighting - according to the design of the cathedral, close to noon At the time, almost all the light will be concentrated on the altar. The bright light is set against the backdrop of solemn grey stone, clearly cutting out the deacons of white and the Medici in red. They are separated at the ends of the big altar covered with three layers of linen, filled with madness and hatred. Contrast, because the muscles that are clenched and the knots cast an unusually heavy shadow on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining two assassins are more professional than the priests, their pace is light, martial arts is superb, and the cooperation between them is extremely tacit, if there is no strong and flexible chain armor And the iron candlestick that Medici grabbed in time (his sabre fell under the altar when he fell down), maybe they had already completed the task - one or two slams that could not be avoided The fine silver-plated iron ring, the broken metal ring and the tip of the sword are deeply embedded in Lorenzo's body, blood rushes, but the Medici parents out of anger and tension have no time to care until the two finally get rid of The enemies of the adversary rushed to the altar to meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Juni?" Lorenzo quickly grasped the sword that the entourage threw and asked aloud as he pulled out the weapon. He saw that the cardinal dragged the broad vestment and panicked on the edge of the gate. He also saw that the serious face of Leonardo, the painter and close friend, was flashing behind the pillars, but he could not be in the chaos of thousands of heads. A blood red velvet cloak embroidered with a golden coat of arms is captured in the arm. Although he repeatedly wanted to convince himself that Juliano had escaped the danger, he knew his brother, and if Giuliano was safe and sound, he would never ignore the brother who was in the life and death. "God of the Virgin Mary," he prayed fiercely in his heart: "Please let him just be hurt, just hurt, not die - even if you lose an arm or leg."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one or God responded to him, more hostile swords stood up and took the sacred priests who entered the church under the name of Cardinal Rafaelo di Riario. The headscarf reveals the faces of the Gentiles. They wave their weapons and unscrupulously open up a bloody road in the panicked crowd, directly to Lorenzo de Medici. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
