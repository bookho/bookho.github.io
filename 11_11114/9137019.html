			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly chicken fainted for a moment, and the short-lived may not even blink his eyes, her eyes are dark, but her ears can still Hearing the violent wind, it was entirely from a kind of inductive feeling. She raised her arm violently, and a hoof as big as a bucket was like stepping on it as she waited, she The arm immediately broke, fell to the chest, and then smashed together with the ribs. The only place to be thankful was above the heart. The ugly chicken's shoulders and part of the lungs became indistinguishable, but she could still painfully Breathing, although every breath is like inhaling charcoal fire into the lungs. But she also knows that she has no second chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not at this time! She shouted in her heart, not at this time, she would not give up! She has endured so much hardship, humiliation and torture, not to sleep silently and worthlessly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can feel the huge, the wings of death are passing over her cheeks, like the power of the mountains cruelly depriving mankind of the last hope, ugly The chicken smelled the dry, monotonous smell, and it was said that it came from mourning the wasteland - she was ready, if she would not escape, then she would not go anywhere, she believed her soul could live The body of the person is as firm and strong. Since she can remove the shackles that the orcs impose on her, of course, she can also break free from the devil's net. It is only a more difficult and rugged road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the power that is about to take her life suddenly disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly chicken opened his eyes, she slowly breathed, turned her head and looked in the other direction - it was the direction of the jungle, she was lying on the ground, only I can see the entangled vines and thorns, and they are slowly retreating to the sides, just as the courtiers make way for their kings, because the blood is full of ears, human females can't hear the sounds of the fine ropes. But she saw a pair of the most beautiful boots she had ever seen. In her memory, all the boots, even the directors, are brown or black, only the bards and the gnomes Wearing red or green boots, these boots are silver-gray, shining in the moonlight, but it looks so light and soft, when the light footsteps fall on the ground, even the blades of grass It will not be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her gaze gradually moved up as the coming approached, ah, the ugly chicken finally saw the scenes that her husband had described to her. It is an elf. Even if you don't need to look at his long ears or hair color, the color of the iris can be known. Humans will not have such innocent looks. His body is so long and slender, but walking around. It is full of strength and confidence. His expression is so majestic, with some melancholy. Without words, he can be surrendered or ashamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf came to the ugly chicken and only used it for a while. He squatted half-heartedly, not paying attention to the ugly chicken’s ** and dirty hands. In the position of her shoulders, she lifted her up, followed by another elf of his, ugly chicken thought, maybe the priest of the elves, he recited the spell, waved his hands, the white light from the sky like a snowflake Flying down, falling into the wounds of ugly chickens, those horrible wounds no longer hurt like that, no longer bleed... Then immediately a small and clean bottle was placed on her mouth, she did not hesitate I drank the contents of the bottle. It was a bit cold, but it was very sweet, and when it entered the body, it turned into a thriving life - the ugly chicken could finally control its body again, she could not wait Open mouth - she even forgot that she had no tongue, and that it was not the words but the dirty blood, mixed with the internal organs, all of which were spilled on herself and the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is very seriously injured." Elf pastor said: "It may not be possible to support the potion to play all the role."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you save her life?" Kerry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We need to pray to Angelus." The priest said, then, purely out of curiosity, he asked: "Do you know this human? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know her," Kerry said. "But I have a hunch that she seems to be able to bring us extremely important information." "The elf priest nodded. If there is only a group of mortals standing here, some people may laugh at this statement. It takes people to want to laugh and anger for the so-called premonition. It is silver. The crown jungle, even if the elf does not have the talent of the caster, can still be aware of the vibration of the silk thread of the destiny with the hateful nature and instinct, but some elves can only feel related to themselves, or very weak, And some are particularly keen, such as their Wang Yingwei, in fact, this powerful caster who has already penetrated half of the body into the field of the gods can almost see the line of destiny of every important person, just do not know this exactly A bad thing or a good thing, because although he was able to see, but he can not toggle them - correction, correct, change or even just to say are not allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the law gives him punishment - in view of his unwillingness to leave the jungle, leaving the plane, it can be said that he gave him a rare opportunity to rest, his body and soul when he fell asleep The same can be calm, not as if you are waking up and suffering from the fate of the trick and crush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry may have inherited the power of his father, Ingway, but he can clearly perceive that after he returned to the jungle alone, It made him understand that he had made a mistake that he should not have made before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray to Angelus," he said. "She may not be my friend now, but she will be."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests walked to the ugly chickens, they connected each other’s fingers, their fingertips touched their fingertips, and they whispered in a low voice, like singing and It’s the birds singing or the wind blowing through the jungle. Humans can’t understand their language, but the ugly chicken still shows a smile. This is how beautiful it sounds. She seems to be able to see these sounds breaking like the sun. The low and bleak clouds, the rain that brought her life, she closed her eyes and smiled like a baby. As every time before, Angris quickly responded to their request, only the elves could see the emerald green transparent stream, forming a vibrant harbor around the ugly chicken, countless lives. The force is poured into the body of this human female, they repair all the scars, smoothing her panic mood, crushed bones, broken blood vessels, broken flesh like the image of another plane is as soft and reversing Quickly bridging, her breathing re-smoothed again and became subtle, waiting until the last syllable of Angelis's gift disappeared in the wind, the ugly chicken could not see the injury at all, correctly said, almost died The traces of serious injuries, Angris's tolerance made her scars still left in her childhood, no more bumps, her skin is so smooth, although the facial features are still so ugly, the skeleton is still the same The deformity, but as long as she lay there quietly, it is a statue that can be named "life and miracle." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly chicken twitched slightly, just like a few years ago, when she was quietly sleeping next to her husband, she was going to be awake when she always It was like this, it was like a reminder and preparation. Soon, she opened her eyes. The first thing she saw was a huge horn deer, like that in a nightmare, but this temperament Even if she thinks that it is not a nightmare, she has lost a lot of things, they have made her painful, and it is this pain and anger that supports her to come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you from?" Kerry Ben softly asked "Men's lady?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The ugly chicken raised his hand to make a gesture, but the Elf Ranger immediately took her hand. "You should be able to talk now," he asked patiently. "Try it slowly?" The scars of the ugly chicken are still very fresh, but The understanding elf does not want to make this terrible scene reappear in her memories, but what he does not know is that the ugly chicken has a heart like steel: "I," the ugly chicken tried: " I came from...the whistling plain...I am...the orc...sir." She gasped for a while, and although the tongue grew out again, there was still a burst of pain in the connected place. I don't know if the body is doing something or remembering to make a ghost. "I fled," she continued, and the speed and fluency were improved: "I fled," she repeated. "Maybe I got it." With the help of a mage, "The ugly chicken still decided to make this matter succinct and clear. The elf was hurt by his own narrative - the one who helped her, maybe he was kind, but he did not show his identity, did not speak or revealed the true face: "We, me and Several slaves fled together. On the way, we met other slaves, but they all fled from the caravans, not the orcs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The orc's demand for human slaves has never stopped, it is only a small number and a large number of distinctions. Kerry took a look at Perant, who was near to him. The manager of Gray Ridge looked heavy. Obviously, the ugly chicken had to say more than that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The animals bought a lot of slaves," the ugly chicken continued. "There are Normans and people from other countries. I can't recognize them." When I licked my lips, an elf immediately sent a cup made up of leaves, and the water inside was still warm. The ugly chicken took over and sipped. "I am not very clear about men. We are separated," she said. "Women are used to give birth," she said firmly, pointing to her stomach. "I don't know if they are I want something to be born, but that is not an orc, it is a monster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of monster?" Perant asked, he smelled the whole thing. Can make any of the druids scream of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
