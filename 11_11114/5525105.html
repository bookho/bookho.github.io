			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next time you come over, you can enter the sanctuary," Yadel said. "I have a small room in the middle hall where you can rest. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe mage glanced at him: "No, Yadell, your teacher hates me, I don't want to be expelled by him."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come?" Yadel said: "The teacher is not a strict person." It can even be said that it is amiable, especially children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second brother stared at him, his eyes were magical: "If you don't know who you are," the soft, cold tone that his diners use. Said: "I just thought you were taunting me - how do I know that he hates me? Yadel, I am the second son of the family, I am the one who should wear a white robe, if not his ruthless Refused me, then it is not you, but me, who is here to invite others into the nave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks at his brother’s cheeks with satisfaction It is pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are lucky, Yadel," the Master raised his hand and gently stroked the cheek of the young pastor: "Have it well, don't I accidentally lost it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalale had to bring a bad Mood to see his new friend, if the black hair caster is willing to be his friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also has a little expectation, as far as he can see, Krimaar is unlikely to be a civilian origin, and Grey Ridge has many advantages, but For the aristocrats who are pampered, there are many shortcomings. At the very least, as far as he knows, there are no servants and slaves in Gray Ridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf’s ship arrives at the Grey Ridge at midnight, and humans or other races without night vision ability always avoid the night when they are on the boat, but for A glimmer of light can see a sly elf beyond a hundred feet. The overnight boating is a waste of unnecessary waste. The flying wing is like a rushing back to the homeland. Like the squid, it continually leaps beyond the stepped rocks hidden in the dark and rushing rivers - step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosada's priest looked out from the narrow porthole, but except for the Mithril flying wing, which was faintly grayish white, he couldn't see anything. The shattered water rushed to his face, bringing it like a fine needle. The pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like Rosada." Yadel couldn't help but hold his brother's box and curl himself into a ball. He really didn't know how many times he had to go. Get used to this thrilling journey. Fortunately, this boating method is not only to intimidate a human being, it also has a jaw-dropping speed. After a small fight in Yadel, he I saw Krimaar. He stood in a soft white light, draped in his leather gray cloak, waving his fingers and helping the boat slow down slowly. It was awful. Yadel vaguely thought that he obviously didn't mind working. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he was happy again, because Kreima waved at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of moss-covered pebbles almost made Rosada’s pastor very sad, and the small box filled with spell materials slipped out of his hand, and he saw it. To get intimate contact with the hard river beach, if it wasn’t for Krimamar’s timely extension of his arm and grab it – its weight would cause the caster’s arm to fall, he would know why Yadel would use it. With two hands, he controls his curiosity, but his sharp ears can still hear the sound of metal colliding with the glass bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Interesting. The lich who rarely spoke since coming to the Grey Ridge suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The real dragon blood, the Lich said, is not the blood of the four-legged lizard used to make ink, but the blood of the real dragon, Although not much, there is the blood of the devil and the devil, and the combined weight can summon a dozen abyss creatures, and they are packed in a box brought by the priest Rosada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——He said this is a spell material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The lich gives a spicy laughter, of course, the spell material, of course, the spell material, why not? Listen, invite him to live with you Give him some honey wine, chat with him and ask who gave him this box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——What do you want to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Not what I want to do, but he, or what the person who got the box wants to do, do it, unless you want to wake up one morning and find that your neighbor has changed to an abyssal plane. permanent residents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before he made an invitation, Kylar made his request, and his reasons were sufficient - time is too late, He didn't want to disturb Kerry Ben or anyone else who might have fallen asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, if you insist," Il said, looking at the two little guys in front of him, and the box: "That is to give Fen Is it a magical material?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said Yadel, "but sorry, my brother asked me to hand it over to Fenway." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Hey, we know who this is for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Find out the identity of the brother. The lich ordered that those who can get these things will not be unremarkable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mage," Il said, but not really angry: "Well, you will give it to Fenway, I will tell him." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalale's brother is also a mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no surprise that if the consul’s second son has a caster, it’s easy to become a mage, no matter which way, politics is still Gold coins, they have to contact more civilians than ordinary people or ordinary wealthy businessmen. What the consul has to do is to choose a strong and appropriate mentor from inside - but what he finally chose is not what they knew before. Any one mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a stranger, Yadel only remembers that his lips are very thin, it’s a deep dark red, like a sharp knife The condensed wound, his body is tall and thin, and the robes draped over his shoulders are as thick as the shadow he casts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first few months, his second brother will also give some tricks to his little brother, like a lively, luminous figure, not moving out of nowhere Too heavy objects, imprinted on books and objects - but as time went by, his contacts with Yadel became less and less, and even no longer talked intimately, which made the consul's nephew feel lonely - he The relationship with Yadel is even better than that of the eldest brother and Yadell. Perhaps it is because of the relationship between the eldest son and the eldest son. For more than a decade, Yadel has only seen him a few faces, and he can say that he has no impression. Their mother died young, and his father was busy with all kinds of affairs. Accompanied Yadel, he was only the older brother who was only three years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
