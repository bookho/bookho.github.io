			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea devil opened his mouth and revealed her fangs to the king of Norman’s kingdom. The orc’s lineage was second only to pure blood in her. In places where humans usually have canine teeth, they are replaced by two pairs of teeth that are staggered up and down, and whose tips are slightly curved toward the inside of the lips. These two teeth can sometimes play the role of flail and dagger, and she bites someone. The throat, sipping blood, or smearing the bloody viscera in the mouth, they not only help her catch the violent victims, but also let the fear kill the enemy, and the crew Courage and ambition. Www/xshuotxt/com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s one thing to be killed, it’s another thing to eat, which is why most people don’t want to The reason why the orcs are related, even the orcs in the inland sometimes dress like a human aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very good, little girl," said the Sea Devil. "I was the first to see that human female performance has such great strength." Her greedy sight fell on the fine gold hammer in the hands of Leona. If the hammer is solid - it must be solid, otherwise it would be impossible to break the steel magic of the sea magic, although she hit the most vulnerable The place—the chain that connects the spike hammer to the rear g-bar, but it’s because it’s more difficult—after the dwarf makes the shield, the flail may be the only one that poses a direct threat to the owner of the shield. The weapon, when it hits the shield, the spike hammer connected by the chain will rotate along the direction of the force to beat the person hiding behind the shield. Therefore, the chain is the only place where the chain is not stressed. If it is just an ordinary weapon, it may only shift the spike of the hammer at the end of the chain by a few inches. The force uploaded from the fine gold hammer is forcing the whole spike. The hammers are all flying outwards. If the sea monsters are beyond the power of ordinary people, her weapons may be taken off directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sea monster is facing an ordinary human female, there is no blood of the dragon or the power of the devil, the sea magic will hit this accident Blame on the hammer that may be enchanted by the handle, she knows that some weapons can make people who use it feel as light as a feather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona did not say a word, the status and pride of the king did not allow her to talk to a female pirate. And rather than talking to the sea devil, she is more willing to hang her on the top of the main mast of the ship, hanging her flail around her neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin stood up, but this time he was no longer so good. Leona stood on his right side and became his right hand and shield. At least the Sea Devils couldn't use this weakness to attack as before, but she kept a lot of hyenas and the pirates gathered around. They have already learned the power of Birdwin and Leona, so they are not in a hurry to go forward, but they are attacking like a quick attack. Their swords and handcuffs are like irritated wasps, although Among them, there were still unrequited pirates who were killed by Baldwin or Leona, but they still caused a lot of injuries that were not fatal but a little troublesome. Leona felt her face numb, because she passed her. A small arrow on the cheek is smeared with poison. It does not immediately kill people, but it can slowly lose the ability to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the weapon surrender," said the Sea Devil. Waving the flail, let the spike hammer squeak in the air: "We don't have to take your life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But behind you The master will meet." Birdwin said loudly, to cover up the instability in the breath, he used to fight in one-to-many, but this time he faced the enemy is the most - and the most embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sea Devil sighed with a sigh: "Isn't it? It's a bit regrettable," she said. "I still like you very much." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seahawk’s crew heard a sly and distorted smile, and Baldwin and Leona were involuntarily achilles – although the Devil In this way, his men did not have the slightest sympathy, and its heavy and heavy is like an elephant. The dexterous thing is like a monkey. When the warrior and the prince are dealing with the swords that are like never-ending swords, they must also be careful that the sea magical steels suddenly fly out of the steel thorns without warning. The wolf hammer on the body has a one and a half times the size of Leona’s hammer. Full of ysen's spikes, as long as it is, it will probably end one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, my dear old friend," Drake said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello," said Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stood face to face, slightly bowing their backs, and they were so similar from the back. After all, they were all taught by a mentor. Gülen’s mentor once said that if Drake does not have a mother who is a girl of Azov, then he can be a thief who can compete with Gülen. Unfortunately, Drake has, the reason why he accepts the teachings of thieves is that her mother hopes that her illegitimate child can get a chance without her power and prestige. After all, Azores is not what it is. A warm and laid-back place, she also has relatives who are both hateful and unable to get rid of immediately. Even if Drake is just an illegitimate child without inheritance, she should be wary that someone will try to take risks, which is why the women’s university The guild is allowed to spread rumors, and a child born in October and born with a lover who can be replaced at any time is basically two different things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between Drake and Gülen was also established at that time, when Gülen just left the big room shared with many children, and Drake Just leaving the mother, they also have the talent of thieves, but also like to play with the means and small clever, so they are more intimate than others. Drake is more instructive than Gülen. As a female grandfather, he has received systematic education, can read and write, and identifies and discriminates this. He is far behind Gülen. The instructor will always be slightly more tolerant when he is at Drake. Anyway, as long as the Azor female grandfather is still alive, Drake will not fall into a thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Gülen always has a stronger relationship than Drake, but Drake is not a Tyre knight. He is not very particular about fairness. The specific performance is that he immediately took a step back after greeting and let him out. The crew behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan’s skill is better than when he was at Point Harbor. He circled, he ducked, he stabbed, but as Baldwin, his problem It is necessary to face too many enemies. When he pours the gold dagger into a pirate's throat, a pirate's gold-plated stabbing knife pierces his waist, and another pirate's dagger is close to him. back. The third pirate waved his whip and tried to entangle his feet. Gülen cursed loudly, and he let himself fall to the ground. The feet wrapped around the whip and dragged the stunned guy down. He rolled over and the dagger swept the first ankle he saw. His waist was hot. The thick y body wet his underwear, he knew he was hurt - he grabbed the idiot that used the whip, lifted him up, blocked a smashing arrow from where he didn't know, but when he saw it The sparse shadow was already late when it was shaking in front of its left side. A strong fishing net tightened his cover from top to bottom and quickly tightened. Gülen knew that the pirates would not care about the companion's life and death. But he still vainly put the guy who was smacked in his chest and painfully vomited blood from his mouth in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drake!" he shouted. He knows that in the reward of the new king, he is the two who live and he is dead, but Drake is not a guy who needs to put hundreds of gold coins into the ranks of thinking. He doesn’t know if Derek’s resentment against him will be Will exceed the thirst for gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs to talk to Drake now, he needs time, if Drake finally decides to put him up and give it to the new king of Norman, then He still has a way to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill him." Drake simply ordered, his tone made Gülen cool, maybe this time he would personally confirm the black The caster wants to know about it - the curse of the god of death is destined that Gülen cannot step into the mourning of the wasteland, and he will only turn into fly ash when he is on the verge of death and in desperation. Then reborn from the fly ash, then if a guy moves fast enough to kill him completely before the change occurs, then he will resurrect again or fall into a lonely soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first handle stabbed the thief's arm. "Kremar!" he shouted desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spell instantly shrouded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drake and the pirates, of course, and Gülen, who was trapped in the fishing net with a dying person, first smelled an unimaginable stench, which was more than a salty fish. The warehouse or the city where the plague spread is still disgusting, and their eyes are irritated. The mucous membranes of the nose and the lips also felt a burst of burning pain. The pirates stumbled on the ground and tried to push their noses into the sand to escape the ubiquitous torture. Fortunately, Gülen was not the first to bear the brunt of them. In order to avoid the sword and the dagger, most of his body was curled up under the pirate. As the face of the deadly part, it was completely hidden, so although he was also affected by the spell, he could bear it. There was no way to make any gaps with him. The thieves' fine gold daggers cut the fishing net easily, and Gülen drilled out from under the fishing net. Several pirates wanted to stop him, but they cut his throat one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the "Golden Lady" was almost mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he figured out who the spell was throwing, he made a direct madness: "Ruiyite!" he yelled and shouted: " What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An accident only." Reyote did not care to say that she was throwing a spell to the black-haired caster, but he was in effect on the spell. At that moment, a small hurricane was set off, and then the hurricane of the miniatures rolled the stench made by Retiat to Drake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreck is still screaming and yelling at the bottom, but Ruiyite has no longer given him even a little bit of attention, she and Cray Mar's battle has entered a critical moment - in Ruiyite's vision, as a warlock, it is not very difficult to knock down a mage, even if their level is not far behind, because the wizard's spells All of them need to be remembered in advance, and before that, the black-haired caster didn't know that he would face a warlock who could choose whatever spell she could cast as long as she could (as long as her mental and physical strength can still support), he What spells will I prepare for the day before? Spell armor, or serial lightning, may also remember a Leomon's cabin, so that you can live comfortably, if he is cautious, he will also remember a dragon skin surgery, or air breathing, but Will he remember fossils as mud? Will you remember sand wall surgery? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what makes Reyote surprised and timid is that she faces a mage, but faces a warlock, and is a battle experience. A sophisticated warlock, he can almost know what kind of spell she wants to cast when she sees her gesture, and immediately uses a spell that can resist or dissolve it, and he seems to have no need to consider it. His spells are like hands-on. Throwing out, but so... effective - the flustered Ruiyite even made a small mistake, let the black half of the half-elf win a chance, his spells roared and hit the female warlock Her coat of arms gave off a dazzling light, and Ruiyi knew that she had lost a precious rune amulet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
