They are immune to mental attacks, and most of the spell damage is reduced. The power is infinite and the movement is quick. The most important thing is that they can change the unpredictable chaos in the sea without any need to lock the force field. Appear in every place... Look for any neck that fits the invisible python, and any creature that is attacked by a chaotic weapon made to break the damage reduction will be subject to the shock of chaotic power. Constant pains and sufferings... until they give up because of intolerance, and they become a part of chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore these darlings of the Chaos Sea rarely encounter such a tough enemy - a paladin in a rough gray cloak, perhaps because of the stop in the Chaos Sea For a long time, the clothes on his body were broken. The only equipment was the dull but tight chain, and the unadorned sword, but this did not affect his high will and strong fighting. Fighting power. Obviously, the double-edged sword, which is more reliable than the appearance, has repeatedly hesitated to slap the sickle that is smashing with ash, and the number of the wounds is increasing as the change of the chaotic sea. The fearless outsiders make more A small number of small wounds accumulate on the white skeleton, although some of them are restored to their original state, but more cracks are connected together and form a dangerous fine net... The pale bones make ominous sputum, and the reaper feels Fear - often this feeling is given to others. The premonition of demise made him retreat, but hesitated because it was forced by the Chaos Sea to execute the distorted command to declare the orderly biological death. Finally, it was a kind of faint, strange, similar to the crying voice made for him. The decision - the reaper of entropy gave up its mission, launched a plane-to-send transmission that only used once a day, and disappeared into the enemy who was too enthusiastic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladin whispered, dispelling the negative effects of the reaper’s last long, cold, vicious breath, and then he had to face up to nothing here. One of the most difficult things in the impossible plane is the cobblestone that is more than five hundred giant ticks. A chaotic fluid is produced from the pebbles of this chaotic sea native. The giant python can recognize these fluids and flow upwards, gather around the spawning to lay eggs and fertilize, and their will even gradually expand a large tabletop pebbles into a continent. But the actions of the giants sometimes turn the chaotic fluids that grow with the pebbles into huge chaotic storms. The worst part is that the giant cockroaches of death will become the guards of the pebbles, stubborn, brave, and hard to destroy. The stone guards will shred any creature or non-living that dares to hurt the source of the storm - with violent hurricanes, innumerable flames, ash, gravel, gravel, hail, and even energy condensation... from this The block is basically madly spitting on the self-contained small-scale mainland outside the order, like a large, multi-material meteor shower with upside down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the frantic python breeding ground smashed a piece of solitary sea like a real stone and quickly left. The aftermath of the cries of the airflow was completely dissipated for a while, and it only left behind The huge strip area that appears to be very "clean" elsewhere in this chaotic plane, although it will soon be filled with more chaotic material, but now looks very similar to the dusty desktop being touched by fingers One of the traces, and because of this, the only thing that stays in it is particularly eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small, quiet, comfortable, but dark space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original face with a smile instantly became serious. The paladin burned a pure flame, especially the forehead, as if there was a sun in the skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to hold his arm has relaxed, and before the wide cuffs of the gray robes hang down again, the paladus’s sharp vision has seen the pale hand bones. Its shape is similar to humans, but it is obvious that the human finger phalanx has only three knots at most, instead of the four knots he sees now, which means that the undead creatures in front of them are transformed by elves or half-elves that are more focused on the elves. Cheng Cheng, this discovery will be even amazed by the gods. Since the destruction of the magic empire, almost no lich has been seen in the transformation of the elves, even the elves who are deceived by the devil and degenerate - the great lich, what a strange noun The relevant written records are probably only the oldest and most secretive on the mainland, and can be found in several libraries protected by semi-stagnant time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It silently retreats into the darkness that is not affected by the light, and the outline of the white skull that is slightly lifted is clearly clear in the shadow of the hood." He "gaps at the light, and does not seem to hate something that can no longer be reached like other undead creatures... subtle, fleeting mood swings are sharply captured by the Paladins - no greed, no hatred, no anger, No **, calm and soft, except for the child's vivid curiosity and eagerness to try, if not the pure negative energy that can almost condense into the body, the rescued person almost thinks that this decaying and filthy bone is hidden in front of the body. A pure soul that has not been polluted by sin - in fact, this is absolutely impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what you are holding out for." The paladin said seriously, "In the name of Tyre, I swear you will receive my thanks. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hollow eyes of the undead, the tiny red light spots jumped, and the paladin could feel the joyful emotions flowing through them. The body, this lich is still very young, he does not even know how to hide his feelings, or that he still has feelings, the old warrior cherishes his wrong choice, his eyes are more determined: "Speak your request." Then I will fulfill your wishes in the name of Tyre, and then liberate the soul that you have not completely degraded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skull in the hood turned left and right, and the skeleton stepped back: "Hey~~," he said at a loss: "Require?? Hey, say, thank you?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a white light on his body, which was much more faint than the Paladin, but it was softer. Sudden changes caused the Lich to be scared, and the airflow in the narrow space became Tensed, controlling the action of the paladin like a shackle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladin’s old face reveals an incredible expression, yes, a covert, simple detection, just to make sure that you are not being lichled The lie is misleading or exploited, but even he did not expect that there will be an undead creature, pure, not for any purpose to save life other than himself, which almost subverts the definition of the lich for thousands of years. Whether it is the nine-story hell of Bata or the blessing of the region. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light that surges on the paladin is rapidly expanding, his figure becomes taller, hey, the radiance is daunting, and finally The appearance of the show makes the Lich unable to stop the chaos in the wind - the fair, the protector of the commander, the incarnation of the god of justice and justice, his thunder-like voice from the top like a solid lava falling on the lich On the skull: "In the name of the God of God, you will be redeemed for your selfless charity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the upper and lower jaws of the bone shelf The distance is slowly increasing. If he is still a personal class, we may describe it as "a mouth can be stuffed into a dragon egg." Salvation, of course, he knows what "redemption" means, and can spell it perfectly and read them, but the relationship between this word and him should stop here, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obvious that fate has fallen into complete hysteria like the Chaos Sea. The Lich’s sorrow and overwhelming are interpreted by Tyre’s incarnation as the resilience and shock of returning to the light. The resulting reaction can't be done. He solemnly lifts the only remaining arm. The god of justice is warm and dignified. The power that cannot be disobeyed is like the overturned sea pressing against the body of the undead. The positive energy contained in it snarls the witch. All the negative energy in the demon has been expelled, and then they have succeeded in replacing their work. At the same time, the gemstones that are thousands of miles away are twisted, broken, and turned into whiteflies, and the nature of life that is carefully hidden inside is forced. Restored to your own body - the enhanced version of the Tough Test that was received at the time of death, once again joyfully descended upon the call of the gods, began to slowly eat away the will and spirit of the Lich... How rare is the second experience, witch The demon sarcastically thought. The inexplicable pain is entangled in every memory and thought in hundreds of years, tapping, grinding, carefully looking for any gaps that may exist, can't get rid of, can't stand it... until all the tests have finished perfectly, The undead are still doing their best, using the body and soul to make the most tragic scream. He feels that there is a voice around him asking him to stop, but the lich is not negligent to ignore, although he knows that it is too long and profound. Torture is indeed over, but in any case, as an evil undead, it is unreasonable not to collect some interest for the harm and torture that I have suffered... As for whether the other party should be responsible for his suffering, well...this is not in the lich Consider the scope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his eyes _--oh, he now has eyes, eyeballs, intraocular cavity and contents, nerves, blood vessels, and eyelids that protect them, eyelashes are all--the lich has blinked his eyes, in front of his eyes The scene has blurred and becomes clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only tranquil and safe place in the Chaos Sea, the Zen Temple of the Seris, the distinctive blue-gray rock and the simple and clean room told him Where the air is flowing, the lich is aware that he is breathing instinctively, the heart is beating regularly, and the blood flows in the blood vessels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some strangely controlling the body to sit up, he found himself wearing a pure white fine linen robes, which is the favorite of the Thai pastors. The kind, there is still a weak power on it - just Tyre, you should also engrave a balance or warhammer on my forehead (Tell's holy emblem is a balanced balance placed on the warhammer), so In order to better reflect the value of this souvenir - for the first time, perhaps the last chaos before, during, and after your birth! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secondary bag for hiding important items is also hung in the old position on the waist side, and the protective amber ring on the little finger that is not far away is still intact. The crown of black opal kept the original invisible state stuck on the head, glanced at the side of the body, a spot hidden with a spotted ochre, a dark, dull unicorn horn wand lying quietly Beside the owner... The lich can temporarily be sure that he has not encountered any loss... No, he thought sullenly, I lost a gray robe, and there was a sway of bones everywhere to chase and threaten humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea of ​​consciousness of the undead is dark and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here, he was able to return to his favorite state - a complete and smooth bone shelf, almost let him blend with the sea of ​​knowledge, empty floating in In the half-empty gray robe, his eyelids leaped with a needle-like blush--a malicious look at the despicable and shameless intruder, thieves, useless waste and feces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly swaying the blurred body, exuding the white and cornflower blue light, trying to reduce the sense of existence but difficult to succeed, the soul is uneasy and cautiously A glance at the black shades in an elegant position - even a single white skeleton and a rag-colored bed sheet can create a Gothic lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
