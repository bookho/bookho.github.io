From now on - point 515 fans festival to enjoy double monthly tickets, other activities have to send red envelopes can also see a look! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little calvin, I didn’t feel very satisfied after writing it several times in a row... Sorry, hey, I will slowly make it up in the next few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona was awakened by an unbearable stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened her eyes to see not the clear sky, nor the crest of the prison, but a tent embroidered with beautiful patterns - lines Zhang Xue is a compulsory course for every aristocrat. It is not exempt and important for a virgin. She can hardly distinguish it from the symbol of the white pagoda and the hills with almost no effort. The white tower is surrounded by silver crown leaves and peacock's tail feathers. The former does not need to be rumored, while the latter two are implicitly symbolizing the importance of the silver-crowned jungle elves and the god of morning light Rosada to the White Tower. Leona is entirely out of the hegemony and instinct of a successor to the throne to curb the urge to reveal a sardonic smile. Imagine seeing what the white tower is like now. The White Tower has been abandoned by the Elf, and its owner is not ashamed to be with the thieves and Fro's pastor. ****, deception, intimidation, theft and blackmail are everywhere. The sanctuary of Rosada is nothing but a day. The precarious island in the flood, if the radiant Rosada really puts his sight on this filthy swamp one day, his anger may turn into an endless flame to burn the entire city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She coughed, but the Queen did not want to continue to pretend, but the smell was too strong and irritating, her eyes could not help but I have to shed tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am rude." A voice said that the whole voice is the most eccentric of Leona’s hearing, because it is like a person. After a large mouthful of water in her mouth, she continued to blow bubbles. She raised her hand and found that her limbs were still extremely soft. She couldn't even sit up from the bed, but her head could still be skewed. As she leaned over her face and looked at the source of the sound, a maid walked past her eyes as she walked over to the front of the fragrant boat and poured spices into it. Then ignited, the fragrance of this spice is very ferocious, almost ignited into the nose of everyone, Liona at the beginning of the time can not help but briefly breathe, she did not have participated in the unfortunate did not have any treatment Separation ceremony. She knows that this rich aroma and odor mix will only make people want to vomit every breakfast, lunch and dinner of the previous year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this did not happen. Perhaps this spice was made for this odor. The odor quickly dissipated under its invasion or cover. Although it was inevitably smellable, the degree was already It’s not that bad – when the maid turned around, Leona found that her cheeks were hung on the side of her cheek, that is, she was usually wearing a veil, and as far as the royal girl was concerned, it was indeed very Necessary - the royal family and the nobles. Even the waitresses around some wealthy merchants are always beautiful and cute, at least they must be beautiful or correct, but this maid, her face may make many people turn around in disgust, her lips somehow She arched up like a wild boar, and the upper lip even covered her nostrils. Her entire lower half of her face became distorted and ugly. If this face is all unsightly, it will be her face. The upper part of the book can be completely praised by the bard, and it is precisely because of this strong contrast. Make her face look extraordinarily shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange thing is why she doesn’t go looking for a priest to fix her face if she is...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Count of Anzhen." Liona said calmly: "The owner of the White Tower and the Hill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The nominal owner." An Zhen immediately replied that she was sitting in the shadow, "put a candle." She said that the pig's mouth maid immediately walked over to light the candle, and the light dispelled the shadow. After the maid's gray robe left, the Norman's prince in the Highlands The lords with the White Tower and the Hill were finally able to talk face to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona’s cocoon narrowed to the point of a needle tip in an instant, and then. In a time when the heartbeat is not available, it is restored to its original state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because any male I have ever seen is strong and rational." An Zhen said that Leona originally thought that her eyes were swept away. A huge shadow cast by the furniture, but she is wrong. This shadow belongs to the ampoule. Her body has become extremely large. It is almost as large as five or six normal human females. The deformed part has surpassed. The normal part occupies about three-fifths of the volume, the strange change invades all her irrelevance, her mouth is pulled down, revealing a curved tooth that protrudes in all directions, one of her eyes It's still as beautiful as all the elves we can see, and the other is like a blind eye that has been stripped of the eyelids. It is red blood, can't see the black pupil and can't see the blue iris. She used to be like a gold hair. All of them fell off, and the bare scalp was full of scorpions. The place where the shell-like ears should have grown was only bare ear holes. Her nose was like a melting fat, dripping from the cheeks. Lips party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She still has a shrinking leg and a semi-rotted arm. She is now naked. Of course, she doesn't wrap herself with clothing because there is no need for it. Every inch of her is covered with thick wrinkled red. No one can detect that she is a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona also knows why she makes such a strange voice. Even if she doesn’t talk, she doesn’t open her mouth, and the saliva will not be able to be sealed. Her lips shed her body, and when they land on the carpet, they make a squeaking sound and white smoke from corrosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My appearance is not very good," An Zhen said calmly: "They all used the relationship of dragon blood for me, the real dragon blood, the royal girl." It is not the blood of the big lizard, it is the real dragon blood, bringing power and bringing destruction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you..." Leona It was entirely subconsciously asked, but she immediately stopped her words. Why did Anzhen produce such a terrible change is not something she needs to care about, and the question may cause her anger, let alone Leona remembers that she was The female warlock and another warlock seized and took away from the Dragon Fire Island, and the female warlock, who had obtained information from Bituminburg, determined that she was the host of the White Tower's Thieves Guild. And Anzhen is the owner of the White Tower and the Hill. She also vaguely heard about some white towers from Yadel and Kerry Ben, plus the old king from Norman in the Highlands. Some of the things her father learned about it, she wants to speculate that it is not difficult to see what is happening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may feel that I am stupid." An Zhen said politely, "Many people think so, it doesn't matter. Occasionally I will feel very good." Stupid - you have a good father, I also have a good father, but the education they give us is obviously different - I used to think that managing a territory is an easy and enjoyable thing..." Seeing Leona After a disapproval expression, she smiled. Maybe, after all, her face is difficult to correctly express her emotions: "My father is a naive guy. He loves my mother very much, but hates her people. Because he always thinks that they will take her away from him, in fact, it is almost the same, my mother is sick, but this is just a foreign statement, um, I was still small at the time, but I can remember a lot. Things, those...souls. The evil red robe and the gray robe. When my mother saw me last time, her fingers were like burnt branches. If I touched the gray, it would fall down, but My father finally succeeded. He will keep his mother forever - the elves may be aware, they hate their father, so it is always to me... ah, you know, their usual practice, calm. Cruel, clear In reality, it’s actually thousands of miles away. You can see them, sniff them. You can get them, but you never want to get trust and love from them... they would rather love a human.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's why you fell and expelled Yadel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fall?" An An’s tentacles slammed the armrests of the seat like It’s a smile.” “No, dear Sir, how do you think so? Or is Yadel saying this? No, he won’t think so. If he really thinks he’s innocent, then he won’t leave the branding. On your own face, do you really think it is beautiful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay," An Zhen continued, and gestured to stop Leo. Na’s next words: “I really want to talk to you, but we don’t have much time. The noble Highland Norman’s prince, I just want to tell you that my situation may be more than I thought. "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You shouldn’t work with those people, or be awkward," said Leona. "They are dangerous, cold, and have no guilt. Dealing with them is like putting your neck in the mouth of a giant wolf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;"I know," Ann said mutteringly. "I know, Your Highness, but I thought you would understand me--" She leaned forward slightly, and the shadows and smells shrouded the king: " You also have... No, you have already fallen into a bad situation, I may be better than you, anyway, I am the owner of the White Tower and the Hill, and you are already a bird without a nest. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you really think you are the owner of the White Tower and the Hill?" Leona couldn’t help but say: "You are sure of your order." Can you leave this room!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the candle slammed a bit, and Leona bit her lip, a huge force Rolling her chest, bringing undoubted pain and threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You shouldn’t say that." Power is coming fast. Anzhen sat back to the original position and said coldly: "Maybe you may not really understand what I mean. You see, you could have a country, and you gave up the country because of a fallen knight. , identity and your last name, and he also kills your father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...is also...a conspiracy...the result." Oona breathed in a big mouth and replied with difficulty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't it?" An Zhenshu leaned back comfortably, and the seat made a creaking sound: "A conspiracy, only you I still don't understand what kind of conspiracy is - but I only see who is benefiting and who is losing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Emotion and justice are not things that can be bought and sold in the palm of a businessman," Leona said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" An Zhen said: "Why is there such a balance in front of the temple of Tyre?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows are shaking, the aunt's maid gives her a cup of milk, and Anan glances at the cup, knowing that this is her loyal maid is reminding her that she and Leona The conversation has been far from the theme she wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So," said An Zhen. "Let us look at emotions and justice. Your Highness, you should have discovered it. It is not a guild." Prison?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there a difference?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is a prison of the guild, You probably won't be like this..." An Zhen looked at Leona maliciously. The figure of the king is more than many southern women. Although her face tends to her father, her lines can be more charming than her face. More: "Complete."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona couldn’t help but shrink, she is a strong and noble woman, certainly not for the sake of others And scorn yourself, but this kind of thing is hard to let go for both men and women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean that I should thank you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not all." Happy to put on the tentacles, "Ruiyite, oh, you know, the leader of the fine net, the pastor and the warlock, she wants to throw you in the thief's nest, but her brother has different opinions, you Very valuable, he does not want you to receive any damage and your value is reduced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't I still want to thank him?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Possibly," Ann smiled and more saliva flowed down his lips: "Because he handed you over to me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A deformed thief has changed into what you look like in the guild room, they There is no hope for him, but if his dagger can penetrate Kyreburn or the black hair caster, it seems that it is definitely good news for them, as if they are called Kreima's waist or chest." See Liao Na suddenly make moving a bit, as if to jump out of the room, loudly warned her companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
