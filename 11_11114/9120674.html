			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the priest and the strongest orc died, the entire team of thieves did not hesitate to break, if this was only from the south The country’s caravans may gather merchants and mercenaries to continue their journey.But for those thieves, it is very unfortunate that this caravan belongs to Grenada. As I said before, they are businessmen and fighters. After discovering that the enemy has been unable to pose a threat to the caravan, some The man returned to the caravan under the command of the owner of the caravan to take care of the goods, while others pounced on the back of those who were under the command of the deputy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal and Crimal, and the young warlock certainly cannot ignore their identity, and Ostal glances at Kremar The black-haired caster stood facelessly in the same place, and did not seem to want to return to the carriage - since Austal did not reveal his identity, the owner of the caravan could certainly not follow the usual practice. For each of them to prepare a separate temporary home, fortunately the use of the carriage is nothing but a day and a half night, they can barely endure - if the trip is to be extended, they must make a decision.Anyway, when a caster needs to sleep or meditate, it is almost impossible for another caster to stay with him, which is why no matter how crowded in the tower or the house, every warlock, mage and even Pastors, even if they are only an apprentice and disciple for the time being, there will still be a room (although sometimes this room will be small like a box with cats)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially the current state of Austal and Crimall is almost ready for two people (at least one of them is suffering from cancer)Although Austal’s attitude was mild and amiable, they had been confronted several times in the enemy’s state. He himself was very clear, even though he made a tolerant gesture and explained all the previous things as A ridiculous misunderstanding, the other party will not really be so stupid to give their own trust - Krimaar is a dragon, after all, if the other half of his body is not the most abominable of the Red Dragons His current position may be above Ostal’s great-grandmother, who is the direct descendant of Gredi, and although the blood of Austal is strong, it is definitely not as clean as he is.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if this is the case, he may also be in the son of the new king.According to Austal, the new king is very favored by Gredith, but his children are not. Greed does not seem to value them, although they do have to master more than the majority of Grenada. More power - but no one can be grateful like the pre-missing Cremari, when everyone is rumored that when he leaves the Warlock, he will be in the pocket of Greed, perhaps For Gretty, the half of his body's blood can stimulate the numbness of his aging because of his powerful life.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it, Austal couldn’t help but reveal a smile that you can often see in Grenada, this eager smile Bick Pastor Lanwo’s crow mouth mask symbolizes pain and death – he never forgets the young red dragon and the two children born to the new king. It can make a human being multiply for generations only to make them More mature, cruel and awkward, and the person around him can be said to have played and mocked them ruthlessly. What would they do when Greedy once again put his eyes on this deformed child? He couldn't help but think of blood, yes, he is not sure who the leader of Kreima is, the only certainty is that he should be very strong and awkward - take a red dragon from the court of Grenada The descendants are not easy, even if he has been subjected to cold and indifference for a long time, but the opposite is what makes Austal confused. At first, this black hair caster is very clumsy, innocent and slow.According to the standard of Grenada, he did not even qualify for the Warlock Tower, otherwise he would not ignore such a possible enemy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even now, Austal is not sure whether the other party’s strength can be equal to himself, but what makes him deeply jealous is that he seems to have a kind of him. Unseen, inaudible, inaccessible, and incapable of perceiving the rebellious dragon - his nephew can always throw the best number, and his enemies always fail or fail And Ostall is one of themIf you must describe it, the red robe feels like he is standing next to a calm and deep whirlpool. When you don't move, it won't cause you any harm, but as long as you reach out or move your feet , it will immediately roll you in completely, and then whistling to grind you into powderDudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what Austal has to do is wait, hide his hands and feet, hide in a corner, wait quietly, look Whether those who jump into the whirlpool can detect a little clue, and whether he can get some of it... valuable compensation - this is one of the reasons why he is always unwilling to reveal his identity along the way, if they are There are too many temptations on the way, so those who are really powerful may take up their tentacles in advance and take a conservative approach like him. This is what Ostal does not want to see.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world also feels that it is better to breathe the fresh air outside than the boring ground in the carriage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Austal can make people feel like a spring breeze when necessary, but the soul of the outside world is stupid (in terms of the lich), but he at least Know what is called a sense of violation - his original plane is stable, but thanks to the developed network, the information it can receive may be better than one of the gods of knowledge in this plane. Voters (otherwise, the Lich can't get a lot of knowledge from him that is quite worthwhile to explore and record from his broken memories). It knows what is called a difficult book and knows what is called human nature.Moreover, although it came to this plane, it inevitably knew nothing about it, but after the undead was like a duck-filling (or elephant-like) perfusion teaching, and the ones it encountered later. "Little Red Riding Hood"... It’s already a deep understanding of how the likes of this inner-empty dress are so bad to the indescribable things - when the souls of the outside world find themselves unable to get rid of the Ottal language and expressions When it comes to the impact, it takes a very quick solution, that is, to reduce the time spent with him as much as possible, he may be as good at the human heart as the devil, but no matter how good he is, it is impossible to scream in the air. Sincerely, it’s too red.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austal should have felt it, but since the role he is now responsible for is a harmonious brother (here we temporarily forget the chaotic generation in the royal court of Grenada) He will not be too aggressive - Kreima waited until those who were sent to recover the thieves, they brought prey, the thieves, the half-orcs, the orcs or the goblins, and some humans, maybe The thieves and the assassins were all ordered to take off all the clothes. A peg was passed from their right wrist and left ankle, and they were put into a string, red and green blood spilled on the ground. Soaking into the dry soil soon<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some slaves," the owner of the caravan did not know when he would come to the black-haired spellcaster: "If you need it, feel free to take it away." This is what you and your friends deserve.He smiled and nodded to the Lich: "I suggest you pick the orcs. The price of the orcs in the market in Grenada has been rising in the past two years. It seems that the orcs in the Whistling Plain have ended the internal struggle." - The supply of large quantities of orc slaves is slowly stopping. It is a pity that almost all of the orc slaves we can get come from the inland. They are better captured than the orcs on the plains of the whistling, but lack the wildness of the orcs, and some will be like humans. Wear silky clothes and spill perfume-soaked drinks on your body - maybe it will be better this winter. It is said that Thunder, the lord of Thunderbolt, has completed the final map, which will provide us with tens of thousands of orcs. Slave, not a corpse, now I only hope that the beast’s offensive is not as good as the previous two years.”dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
