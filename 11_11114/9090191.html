Other children have been wondering why he was wearing all the clothes meticulously while sleeping, or even taking off the squeaky accessories, but now this move can save him a lot of time, and the dark black water engulfs him. ——When he was swimming in other round houses, he had spared a glimpse of plum honey. She still exuded a soft and dangerous light. In the clear sea, her arms spread out and the silk robe floated, making her look Like a big phoenix butterfly that solidifies in amber - only a very short-lived look, like a naughty little sea fish, the son of Anzhen swims from the side of the coral column that supports the round house and climbs up in a dripping Twisted narrow plank road. In addition to the round houses where the children live, the other round houses are connected by plank roads, but Mei Mi took them there without going through the plank road. She used ships to send them directly to the only round house isolated from the same kind. Inside, and the light at that time was not much brighter than it is now. Even so, the boy still remembers the approximate orientation of several round houses - the largest round house is the temple where the altar is located, and the plank road before the temple leads to the coast. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s fortunate that even the most greedy and gracious pastors and their lover have fallen into the inevitable exhaustion after the madness, over the path No one, but the boy immediately heard the sharp voice of the child, he did not know that they were described as beautiful but very terrible Mei Mei was scared or there was another devout priest reserve who was fatally punished, he only knows However, a few breaths will be run out to see what happened. The chief pastor of this temple is not reliable enough. If he is caught, the best result is to be sent back to the round house. The worst result is Found to be a boy and charged with blasphemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aunt's son did his best to pull down the silk skirt, ran up, and grabbed the rune ornaments on the chest, this accessory can randomly transfer the boy Going somewhere, but he doesn't want to use it for a while, he knows what the random transmission is, just like the girl knows what Fro's pastor is - he hears someone yelling and letting him stand, but he doesn't look back The ground drilled into the dense and dark fern grass on the shore of the sand. Before that, he took off the sleeveless shirt. The sleeveless top was light-colored. It was so eye-catching under the night, a man chased. Going up, but when he found the white shirt, he found the gold bracelet and other precious ornaments. He hesitated and looked at the fern that had calmed the waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man is just a thief. Although he can afford to spend the opportunity to spend a good time with Pastor Fro, the money bag is not as full as people do. Although it feels bloated and hard, the thief knows that it is filled with copper coins and Silver coins, of which copper coins account for the vast majority - he can catch the escaped child, but that means he also lost the opportunity to get the unexpected wealth, so he eventually grabbed the child’s leftover With that silk sleeveless top, quietly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy can almost say that he has escaped from the place that may be affected by Fro’s anger. He knows that the jungle in the night is extremely dangerous, and if it falls at dawn Before he wandered outside, he was likely to be seen as a slave to escape and was sold, even if he had magical tools for defense and attack, and, unlike Ampoule, he had the talent of the caster, but he It’s too young now, and any resistance to any kind will lead to results that he doesn’t want – he’s observing the outside world clearly visible in the cobalt blue sky with a cloak of grass blades, seeing a few He was a little ecstatic when he had a dot and a row of footprints. He knew the mark, and Anzhen held it with him. The soldiers of the White Tower would leave such traces in the courtyard because they were When they are marching in line, they are holding a spear. They will put the spear on their shoulders while walking, but if they stop, they will insert the spear into the ground shallowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers that when the Cavaliers came to Meimei’s room, Mei Mi would chat with him. After all, they couldn’t really do anything, some problems Will avoid, but some insignificant things will not be deliberately concealed, he can be said to respect Mei Mei, perhaps because of the relationship between Gülen, or she is also one of the companions of the side island lord, the boy heard They will set up patrols, just like in the Thunder and the White Tower, and every night there will be a group of five soldiers armed with patrol docks, pubs and warehouses - the Temple of Fro seems to be included. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy chased him along the footprints. He was exhausted when he saw the soldiers, a round face, and a very young soldier caught him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahn’s child has not received any punishment and has not served hard labor. His skin is whiter and cleaner than some women, and the soldiers are catching him. I couldn't help but shiver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No branding," the soldiers’ leaders said, "It should not be a slave." Or have not yet become slaves. He picked up thick eyebrows, and the people from Norman in the Highlands have not fully adapted to the Longhuo Islands. They are not in contact with the slaves, so they still have a bit of compassion. "Is anyone chasing him?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
