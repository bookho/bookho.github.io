			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentle morning light gradually became glaring, and the air that gradually became hot added a disgusting suffocating and stench. Plum was tightened. The robe looks out from the shadow of the house to the gate of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Meimi, Solo is a strange city, but she has traveled through many such small towns, and their planning can be said to be similar - the city's The central government must be the official residence of the central square and the consul, surrounded by the shrines of the shrines (some exceptions to the special requirements of orientation and location), on the outside of which are the houses of the people in the city, generally The closer to the center, the more prominent the identity of the inhabitants, the richer the family, the more the craftsmen and servants can live near the edge of the city wall, the peasants are confined around the manor outside the city, and the slaves can only be in the desert Looking for a place to live in the countryside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ominous mansion faces a wide street, standing on the street, looking forward to see a fortress with low wall guards Architecture - a black flag fluttering on the tall spires, indicating that the city is suffering from an epidemic, so that people can get away from it as quickly as possible - she sees it very clearly, so from Bedwin, and those weird After the priest Ke Lanwo escaped, she did not hesitate to go in the opposite direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei doesn’t know if the pastor of the god of death with a beak mask will chase after himself. All she can do is to use her last point. Strength, although it does not remain much. She was with Bedwin last night, he needed to indulge himself as a priest of Fro, who was best at this, when Kerry’s slap in the face of Baldwin’s slap in the face When they woke up, they only slept for a little while—everyone knows that this situation is more unbearable than not sleeping at all—Mei only hopes that their new home will have a large, soft bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her wish has come true, in a way that can’t be worse, they can get hundreds of large, soft beds, if you don’t care if it’s covered with The words of blood and stains of the disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei was almost unthinking and chose to escape. She was the pastor of Fro, not Ilmot or Crawford. Tyre and Rosada have nothing to do with her. She cherishes her life more than anything else. Although her heart can't help but feel pain when she thinks about Bedwin, she didn't even dare to see Bird when she fled. A warm look, he will be disappointed. Still sad, or will understand why she is doing this, she was only scared by the death of Russ, she prayed to Fro, praying that she could help herself continue to grasp the man's heart. Let him not forget or give up on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he might die here, another voice said to Mei Mi, Mei Mei knows where it came from, it is her soul, the soul of Pastor Fro, cold and realistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would let him die here, Mei Mei said to herself, don’t let me see him, if he left me with aversion and indifference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ran all the way, panting. Her heart hurts like being twisted and twisted, her throat is filled with the sweetness of blood, and her feet are like a petrified cast by someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is following her, the priests of Baldwin, Gülen, Crawford, and the elves and wizards are not there. They are left behind by Plum. If she said that Mei Mi was still somewhat puzzled by this, she knew everything when she saw the gate blocked by the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless abyss is down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they won’t chase. Because it is not necessary, it is impossible for Mei Mi to push open these heavy blockages and open the gates to go out - she can't climb or fly over the city walls. The multi-spirited walls are only half the height of the Norman kings. . But this is not the obstacle that Mei Mi can rely on and the goddess to overcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was angry and desperate. When she saw a projection with a long curved mouth turning from a corner, Fro’s pastor stumbled. The ground opened a wooden door that was around. Thanks to Cranbo's pastor, because they want to converge the relationship between the deceased and the living, the doors here are almost open. Providing a hiding place for plum honey is a two-story building. It was inhabited by several families. Like other places, there were dirty black blood everywhere, even without the cover of grass and ash. Several places with visceral debris had already produced white worms - Pastor Froo covered My own mouth, looking for the kitchen - these families may be handicrafts, they follow the habits of the craftsmen, do not cook soup or toast in their own workshop, and finally plum in only a sealed pottery She found some clear water, and she was hesitating for a long time with the clay pot because she didn't know if the water had been contaminated by people with the disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drink it." A voice said that Mei Mei initially thought that the voice came from herself, but she immediately found out that this was a man talking. Although it sounds sweet and gentle, the sound of a man talking to a woman can still be distinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drink it." The voice repeated once: "That is the water used by the goldsmith to polish the gems, which is cleaner than the water they drink. No one will drink it because it has almost no impurities, so it is such a The pottery is also close to the price of a silver coin - the male owner here, even if his son is dying, he is not allowed to touch the jar, let alone others."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei honey found the owner of the sound, and she almost surprised to throw away the clay pot held in her hand. Because the end is sitting on the simple wooden table and talking to her is nothing else, it is a black, furry hamster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you so surprised?" The hamster said, "No, you are a pastor, hey, even if it’s just a priest of Fro, but you should listen. Having said that the existence of the little monster, we are very smart, the human language is not so difficult to master - drink saliva, dear, you seem to need it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mei honey subconsciously did it according to its words, until the water entered the throat, she realized what she had done, she instinctively closed her mouth, but because it was too fast, the water flowed into the trachea and coughed up in a whim. But as the hamster or the little monster said, the water in the clay pot is not like being preserved for a long time. It is both sweet and cool, and it is very cool. It will be in the plum blossoms. The burning flames are extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...have heard of it," but never seen it: "And, the poets often say that the little monster is more similar to humans, with limbs and Finger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think they have seen all the little monsters?" Hamster. Little Monster, of course, the most correct answer, the little devil Asmodeos said: "There are all kinds of little monsters. There are people like people, like hamsters, and like fish or birds. They only saw one of them, but they were arrogant and ignorant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It licked its tail: "Sit down." It continues to be sweet. The voice said: "Sit down, dear, you should take a break - then let's talk about it again - you probably have to eat a bit." A piece of ** cheese that didn't know where to get it fell into plum In the silk gown, she caught it in a hurry and took a bite in her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you really a little monster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," Asmodeos Nothing to say: "Is it still a little devil? The little devil will only drink your blood, eat your flesh, but will not give you food and drink, only the little monster will do this. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mi slightly relaxed, she was holding clay pots and cheese. I found a fairly clean corner, her shoes ran away, her feet covered with dust, and small wounds, but it was because of the dust, the wounds did not flow too much blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have heard of it--" She smiled reluctantly: "Little Monster, is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's right," Asmodeus waved his tail and wings, and Mei Mei's eyes became even more confusing. Obviously, she is trying to remember the message she got from her companions and lovers - but the little devil is not worried about what she will perceive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are standing here is the stinking Elf Ranger, or the Lich, or Birdwin. The little devil is definitely not going to say such a ridiculously ridiculous lie - the little devil and the little monster sound very similar, but the difference between them is as big as a plane - the little monster is the natural crystallization, They are small in size, low in intelligence, some mild in nature and somewhat temperamental, and they like to make some innocuous jokes. But as Asmodeos said, they are also very willing to lend a helping hand to those in need, and the little devils who are transformed from evil spirits, full of evil, mean and cruel are completely different creatures. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Plum is just a stupid, selfish, shallow-looking Pastor Fro, so Asmodeos can do whatever it says, if not it The hair is too dark, and its wings are fleshy wings, and he is too lazy to cover up, he may still say that he is a light elemental creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you adopted by this owner?" Mei Mi looked around, and the owner may not have left voluntarily, but this small workshop Apparently carefully cleaned up, this pottery jar was originally covered with a poor quality linen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so," Asmodeos shrugged, although its shape was doomed to be seen by Mei Mi at all: "I am here with The owner is a friend," it aggravated the tone: "Equal friend relationship," it sighed in a pretentious manner. "Poor old guy, he could have lived for several years." It paused: "Yes, Can I ask a question? Dear lady, you don't seem to be a multi-spirited person - you are so beautiful, if I have seen you, you will never forget - but I have lived in Solo for decades, right You have no impression."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am..." Mei Mi said: "I came with my companion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," Asmodeos said: "It seems They didn't take care of you - you look bad - they are infected with the disease so they can't get it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...they Just a little bit with me, the opinions are inconsistent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That can't be a reason," said the little devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to leave here." Mei Mi said: "But they don't want to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really strange," said the little devil. "All people want to leave here. They should also leave here. They can't stay here and wait to die. If it weren't for me, I wouldn't be affected by the disease. Will go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei glanced at it gratefully, she now needs someone personally, she did nothing wrong: "But I failed," She said: "They blocked the gate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw it," said the little devil. "Human thoughts are sometimes weird. Then, you What should I do now? There is not much food in the city, and a large part of the white robe is taken away. That piece of cheese is my only remaining food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Mei Mi bowed his head, the piece of cheese left a piece that was not big enough to be fingered, and she was pinched tightly and had changed shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you go find them?" asked the little devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...When leaving," Maymi said: "My approach is not too...well, gentle..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you are a woman," the little devil said sincerely: "And it's so beautiful... they should forgive you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mei smiled. "Maybe." The little devil's words really cheered her up, right, Byrd, she had at least Bedwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin lying on the bed, it was a fairly comfortable bed, Iraq Almaty's pastor moved from the owner's house, and every patient here may die at any time. When they fail to get the cure for the disease, they can only give these unfortunate people a little comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
