These two methods, if you have already purchased it before, do not need to re-purchase, do not repeat the payment twice, please feel at ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also know that this will cause some inconvenience to the readers. I apologize here, in order to compensate everyone, if there will be in the future, there will be five hundred to one thousand words. Thank you for your support and encouragement! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note, although this paragraph is not placed in the author's words, but less than 500 words will not be counted, please rest assured, because behind the fear Some adults will not notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter in the memory of Leona, it has always been white, hard and cold. If you want to describe it, he is like a horse riding a gray In white armor, holding a transparent pistol across the highlands of Norman, the knight-like great god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winter of Longhuo Island is soft, just like those businessmen, the ruthless heart is masked under the warm and weak appearance, from the Moon Festival The cold current that crossed the Longji Mountains has finally arrived here after thousands of miles of trek, but the rest of it can only be said to be the end of the strong. When they encounter the hot and humid air on the sea, they become a thick layer of lead-gray and a long and desperate rainy season. It is more unbearable than the heat of September. It’s hard to see the sun all the time. The rain that never stopped was like a dying king. Although it was irreparable, it still clung to its authority and tried to infiltrate every part of the Longhuo Island with greenish black moss. They are ubiquitous, even climbing to the lamps and urns. The transparent traces left by the shellless snails are like the saliva left by countless fines of food. The water vapor in the air makes people feel like they are in a huge bathroom. Even breathing is difficult. Whether it is linen or silk, it will stick to the skin in a few minutes, bringing a clay-like sticky feeling. The maids have transferred 50 people from the "hands", specifically for the side island. The owner and his friends and subordinates provide a dry interior and exterior clothing that is hollow. Clean and damp fabrics can be hung on either side of the huge wall that burns the charcoal fire inside, thanks to the ingenuity of the gnomes, instead of ironing with iron pans with carbon blocks as before. Only then will the eunuchs around Kreima be left in a dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona sat in her room, leaning against a thick ivory, the ivory was smoothed, and there were four gold-plated ebony feet underneath. The creamy surface is engraved with a delicate and elegant grass pattern, but the depth is not three hairs. The person who leans on it will not be able to slip open because the contact surface is too smooth, or it will stick to it because of the hot and humid sweat, and it will not hurt the delicate skin because the uneven surface is too sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the red days of the Dragon Fire Island can melt the sand into glass, the Norman king of the Highlands can still walk up the hot streets. Let the sun turn your skin into a lustrous olive, but in this awkward season. Poor His Royal Highness is like a sword that draws all the strength. She is lazy all day, can't afford a little spirit, and doesn't want to do anything, oh. No, wait, maybe in addition to jumping into the sea and enjoying the amethyst bath in the room of Plum, if she wants, Cremari will certainly not take a bath, but Leona likes to see it. Mei Mi’s face is like the taste of fermented shark meat, but Mei Mi can’t refuse “he”. After all, Leona is only taken from the pocket of the Norman’s court, and everything is taken. It’s enough to make other Fro priests crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer Fro, who has a hard time, not only has to give up his favorite bath, but also has to be a maid, and Leona is like a handsome man. The little family, she is still a woman, and her chest is broad. Simply put, there is a little more on the top and less below. Mei Mi can't let other people serve her. If it is not the temple of Fro, it will be considered. However, in the case where the women here are almost all Pastor Fro, even if they give a glass of wine, they will not easily let go of this opportunity. Maybe it is such a wrong eye, there will be a slender little hand that should not go. Location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Liona’s honey, berries, lamb or crab, or nuts, clean linen towels, soft silk gowns, etc. They are all sent in like the arrogant plum, and they don’t let other priests intervene. They certainly can’t help but complain a few words, but Mei Mi is their chief pastor, and there is any one she thinks is no longer affected by Fro The beloved pastor has the right to expel, so in the end they can only take a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei knows, but let them go to hell, to deal with a Leona is enough to make her irritated, even want to come to her to drink Glan, who had a glass of wine, was also driven out by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Aona doesn’t always see An Zhen’s son every time, even as a little maid, their age is too small, that little boy Even a heavy silver cup can't afford it. Some of the priests have frowned. They don't understand why merma is doing this. Some Fro priests will have to do this because they There is a special lord or king in the area. Fro's temple cannot provide them with priests and paladins who can cast powerful magical skills, or as well-known rangers and adventurers, not to mention the gold and whirlwinds of the gold whirlpool. If there is a lack of Cranvo, if it is not protected by the superiors, then the thieves’ guild will be able to calmly turn Fro’s temple into its own free play and the best place to gather intelligence and wealth, just like It is in the White Tower but Mei Mei does not need it. The owner of the side island is tolerant of her, and is a half-elf mage full of abstinence and moderation. If the pastor is to believe that the former will actually fall to play with young children, it is better to say that the devil climbed to the shore and sat on the throne of Fro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These children were left in the deepest part of the temple by Mei Mei in the name of learning music and dance. As we said before, the temple of Mei Mi is composed of a dozen white coral houses, and the depths of the temple are essentially Enter the end of the ocean. The last room was used to worship Fro's altar, and the few that were not far apart were formal inner and separate chambers, one of which was not connected to any round house, and Mei Mi placed all the children in the room. There, the plums responsible for their diet and teaching them need to row a boat to enter the hut. Although this can't isolate each pair of eyes, it can't form any unbreakable obstacles, but at least there will be no intoxicating guests. An accident occurred between the intrusions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that makes Mei Mei feel good is that the child is very smart and healthy. He has not been sick. I can also wear clothes, bathing and eating without the help of others. I never cry, if there is any need, I will only quietly say to Mei Mi, and I will not run around like a naughty boy like a naughty boy. Shouting, sceptical eyes and unknown scourges, he is as alive as a small animal forced to leave his mother, with a skill derived from instinct. And Mei Mei was surprised to find out, but for a few days. Those children are faintly headed by him, perhaps because he is still a boy relationship after all? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona thinks that the eccentric look of Mei Mi’s here is involuntarily giving off a sweet smile, even the rain that beats the ferns and palms. So much annoyed, she really liked the child, although he did not have the blood of the Normans in the Highlands, but he is like a Norman child. Except for the eyes and hair color, there is almost no resemblance to his weak and insidious father, and the neurotic mother. He is strong and agile. There is a whispering language but there is a kind of majesty above the crowd. Mei Mi said that he is like an old monster occupying the child's body, but Leona has seen how he snuggles around his mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say that one can grow up at the fastest speed is the separation of life or death, this sentence Li Aina has a deep understanding, and that child Should also have the same feelings as her. But he is more fortunate than Leona, because his mother, the white tower and the ampoule of the hills are still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alvara Master of Biyindibao has a message, she showed up on the Harvest Festival and the Moon Festival, this is her marriage with Demon After the first time as a ruler to inspect her territory, her side is full of warlocks and mages, so they are not sure whether she is being held or threatened, but from the outside, she has almost never had to take dragon blood before What is the difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the elf of the silver-crowned jungle interfered, and she thought that she really hoped that Anzhen would be safe and sound, because she and Birdwin’s plan changed because of the secret of the metal dragon, as a heir to the throne. Na certainly wants to get an adult, can hold all the support of the ruler, at least part of the authority, instead of raising a child, even if he may become the most loyal ally of Leona outside Norman, is also a dozen Things after the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought for a moment and then turned her thoughts into another, more relaxed and enjoyable field. Anyway, it’s easy It’s too frustrating to play tricks and sinisters in a depressed climate, or let her sneak in a illusory dream, such as the grand celebration that she and Baldwin had when they got married, and their child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A boy, destined to wear the crown of Norman Norman, pick up the scepter with sapphire and stone, perhaps her father, promise The children that Man's Pharaoh wants to obtain in countless prayers and pleadings are stronger and more dexterous than the sons of Ahn, and the mind is full of wisdom. All the people will bow to the knees when they see him. He was born. A king, and the best one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leona?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sweet fantasy makes Leona until Baldwin When I walked into the room, I couldn't put away the smile on my face. She was looking at her lover tenderly. Baldwin came to her and turned in a direction before sitting down on the floor, not in Leona. The left side is on her right side, so the hand he used to hug her is not a cold, dangerous and quirky Mithril arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A silver coin buys what you are thinking about now," Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly less," Leona said: "But I can give you a discount," she kissed and kissed Bedford's beard: "Our The future."--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gloria opened the hand of Pastor Fro, and pushed her rudely, the priest screamed, apparently injured And she didn't think that the thief would open her so ruthlessly, so the posture of the fall was not beautiful, it could be said that it was uncomfortable, and her silk gown also made a shock to her when she tried to stand up. Tearing, she hurriedly looked down and saw that the silk gown had turned into two halves, and it was terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
