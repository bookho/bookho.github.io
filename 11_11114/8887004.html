			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderbolt people use a rather ancient method to make torches. First, they will cut a wooden stick about two feet long. A tapered pit is made at the top of the stick, a wick is placed in the pit, and then compacted with dry turpentine. The rosin can be added after burning - this kind of torch is tied to those with branches and grasses. The burning time is longer. If the top of the torch is large enough, it can last for a second (one hour) before the tapered pit is burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also brighter than loose branches, ordinary twigs can only illuminate one or two people, and the light cast by this torch can be It is covered by three to four people, but in any case, it cannot be compared with real sunlight or moonlight. From this range is a turbid and cold darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps of people and the light brought by the torch gradually fade away, leaving only two people in the empty passage - the caster Krimer and the thief Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan did not immediately answer the question raised by the culprit, although he knew that he was facing a spellcaster, but his heart had been filled with hatred and despair. He doesn't feel that he still needs to be afraid of anything, but what else can he do, it is getting into the darkness, and as a sophisticated thief, even if there is only a slight light or nothing, it does not hinder his theft or Assassination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are a group of good people." Gülen said, not without irony: "Mage, they didn't throw me into a cave again, nor did they put it anymore." I was kneeling on a piece of wood. Although I still wore a donkey, I had a room. There was a bed in the room. The knight who guarded me also brought water, wine, barbecue and bread. I was full, I slept again. They talked outside my room, no reason, maybe because they thought I was going to die, or maybe because they were talking about no secrets - Thunder Castle may fall, so inside The people will be removed. I heard that this is a good opportunity..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I didn't kill," Gülen said, " They may be dizzy for a while, but they won't die. If their Sir Alex did not throw them to the orcs, the respected mages, in a sense, they are extremely credulous and lack of vigilance, you know, They even have a heart for me because I got unfair treatment. Even if I was a thief. "He glanced at the Master through the last glimmer of light eyes, dark eyes, like a deep, hidden secret with you unimaginable danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intuition tells him whether he killed someone in the process of fleeing will lead him to two completely different endings - he did let go of the two self-righteous small iron cans, he is not an assassin after all, murder is not his The main business, and he is not sure whether his escape can be successful, he will only be locked up before they can find the victim, but if there are really one or two bloody bodies to accuse him, then Thunderbolt Master Bodwin will be very happy to cut his head with his wide sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if I am a thief," he repeated: "But I was treated unfairly in front of the Knight of Tell. You see, if he is I have to judge me on the charge of killing the little bastard. Unfortunately, you have testified for me. I have your rope wrapped around my neck that night, in order to find a comfortable position for you and a warehouse for hollowing out the guild. And I’ve been busy all night, I know, you’ve been watching me all the time, I can’t kill someone who’s thousands of miles away, right? Then, if he killed a god of death. The priest’s charge came to judge me, dear mage, or something else, that was before I was sent to Thunder Fort, and as an innocent person, I was with the sinful bastards. I kicked the wall and threw it in front of thousands of orcs, ah, strong and hungry orcs, if I didn't have a little bit of good luck, I was already in their stomach pockets - but I didn't Resent them, I even finished them The task of generation, even if I am not guilty, I did it. For the victory of mankind, I killed the orcs, destroyed their instruments, and saved the life of an elf. I did so much, Master, I What other crimes can't be forgiven? But the respected Sir Birdwin still failed to give me the freedom I deserved, so I had to take it myself, but I didn't take anyone's life. I swear by my mother’s grave, I took a set of clothes at the top.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And the identity of the owner of the clothes.” The Lich said that he slightly lowered his head. His eyes glowed in the darkness, and Gülen’s appearance was very different from that of his own, and he could be said to be another person. If you are standing there not the undead who was once, and Gülen is not an important material for his reservation, he should be able to escape from this interesting little trick: "Where are you throwing him?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In his wooden barrel." Gülen said that he knew that refusal was useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must hide him very secretly," the Lich said in an elusive tone: "The orcs may not be able to find the kind." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hid him in a salty fish bucket," Gülen said. "But the orc's nose is very sensitive. I don't guarantee that he will be safe, but I can guarantee that he will live well when I leave." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally he was not prepared to leave with these people, it was too dangerous, and the fields and wasteland outside the city could provide shelter for a fugitive thief - But he was discovered that a team of knights rather than a knight, fortunately, he was familiar with the person he replaced - one of the jailers of Thunderbolt, he was weak, eccentric, unpleasant, no friends and no relatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If today’s body is another soul, the lich is thinking, it will be very tangled – facing one... um, the essence In the sense of sinners, it is certain that the thief Gülen will not be a pure girl who has only taken the knife as he described. He is not only a thief, but also the leader of a guild division - but no one can come up with it. What evidence or witnesses prove what crimes he actually committed, after all, he was far from the port of Point, and separated from Thunder Bay by the bay and land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other soul belongs to the plane with so many ridiculous moral standards and decrees - all kindly similar to ridiculous, and it is It’s been nearly thirty years of this kind of peace of mind with foolishness and paralysis. It’s imaginable, it’s sweet and soft – it’s only in the face of an orc, halfling or ogre. It can be said that it is within the tolerance of the Lich, but if it is faced with a human being like him, or something similar to human beings, such as an elf, its weakness and innocence almost make a former undead Go crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no curse of the god of death, the lich is willing to leave Gülen to the soul of the outside world - Gülen said clearly before, according to the highland Man’s law, he has redeemed his previous sins, he is innocent, he has the right to return his life, but a thief, a thief abandoned by the guild, no one is concerned about and not restricted, he is in mortal It is unexpected that the villages in the clusters or the towns can cause much harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does it do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team that has gone forward has come a long way, surrounded by a turbid and quiet darkness, and Gülen’s fingers stroked his hips, hiding a piece of shattering there. The cracked obsidian, thin as a piece of ice - he stole and broke an obsidian amulet, picking out the sharpest piece from the debris, a small piece that could not be pierced by the palm of his hand. An ordinary person's hand may not be able to kill even a fish, but in the hands of Gülen, its fatality is in no way inferior to the arrow or the short knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
