The noble woman said: "Given their feelings are far better than what you think."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, mother," Fukai said: "They will see me again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he lowered his head and put on a heavy crown, in the room on the top floor of a minaret, the man who was thought to have died by everyone was standing in front of the small window, admiring the scene of the beautiful scene below. "They may I will blame me," Fu Kai said. "Especially my son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A country destined to die is not worth remembering," said the woman. "Your son will be a member of the royal family of Grenada in the future. This identity is more noble than any grandfather or king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am just A mortal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will see how you work," said the lady. "Although you need After a while, okay, now, we should go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————— ———————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Dragon Greedy in the dark room睁Open eyes, Fu Kai is her son, but also a failure product that even Kelmen and Kelsey are not as good. A thousand years ago, she was able to make a strong dragon with her own red dragonfly. Hundreds of half-dragon descendants can be born in mortal form with human beings. But after a thousand years, she still has a strong desire and desire for the child, but the law in the dark does not allow her to continue to produce offspring - Fukai is a remnant left after a bad experiment, she I thought about giving up on him, but in the end she left him and gave it to his mortal father. He couldn’t touch the magic and he was not good at martial arts, but he was not saying that he was a stupid guy - no one knows, the highlands. In fact, Norman has been hollowed out by Fu Kaisa to the ant worms in all directions, leaving only a sleek outer shell. As long as someone pokes it, he can see its weak and incompetent inner lining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory has never even appeared in front of this weak but ambitious mortal, but wants to come to Fukai will not care too much, what Grid masters It was his dream, the dragon blood, not only gave him life, but also gave him youth. Although he is a mortal, he can enjoy the treasure of the dragon like any dragon. He may feel the honorable and powerful red dragon. He won't ask for anything from him, and he won't hurt him. So he has always been quite calm - in fact... not, he is not a Grenada, he doesn't know even the Red Dragon. Just give a drop of water and ask for the spleen of a whole lake. Every drop of dragon blood that he swallows in the mouth needs to be repaid. Maybe in the near future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave a soft breath, and Mars jumped between her teeth, illuminating the garnet-like scales, without warning, The hearth in the room burned up, the fire shook, the red dragon looked at them, the flame here was new, very weak, so in a short time, it would not produce fire elemental creatures from inside, in the red dragon There may be in the nest, but they will hide themselves, because they are also one of the foods of Greedy - this is one of the problems facing Gredith, she does not know that she has reached that point, although she It is indeed acceptable and pleasing to hear her name. When people read it, her power is arrogant and she can easily walk outside the country of God and a few areas, she Without fear of weak gods, she can also negotiate face-to-face with the demon king, but she knows that she still lacks an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of know that there is still one step to get a wish, but even the position is ignorant, the red dragon is anxious, and it is in the silver crown jungle. She knows that the king of the Singh Elf, Engel, can find more clues than her in the net of destiny. The power and wisdom of Ingway has always been her coveted thing, just like This time, the king of the jungle, Ingeway, may have touched the line of destiny that connected to his descendant Kerry himself, and she, Kremar is obviously her descendant, but she has to wait for him. When you enter the northernmost land, you can see the flashing fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't let me down, little guy." Red Dragon whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— —————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slave merchants are eager to move, in this position, Grenada’s slave resources were originally the most abundant, but now Grenada has even had a tight demand for slaves in Wangdu, not to mention other regions, as well as Longhuo and Azores, but these are usually the same as mice and rabbits. Is the goods really exhausted? of course not! On the other side of the mountain, on the other side of the sea, there are tens of thousands of slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now he is not in the kingdom. There is also a fallen Rosada pastor who integrates everything for him, but he does not know what he is now. Some people say that he may have been killed by Kelsey, and some people want to Kelsey asked about one or two, but the cursed bottomless abyss, the sanctuary suddenly entered the state of martial law, the people inside could not come out, the outside people could not enter, and the high-ranking priests spoke a few words - they It may be offering an unprecedented grand sacrifice for Greety - but that's all. The merchants waited for a few days in disappointment and found that the priest with the brand on his face did not appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do we really want to do this?" A businessman said uneasily: "That is, I mean, the direct blood relative of the respectable lady. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a temporary call," another businessman said. "We still need to maintain relationships with other places. Slaves are indispensable, and soon, Follow the children of the vassal army to bring back more slaves..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I heard that the Three Legions had almost no living people along the way. "The third businessman said: "Only the one has his own ideas, otherwise we don't have to be in this embarrassing situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Not all cities are on the road ahead of Grenada,” the first businessman said: “After the minions and the heads are destroyed, the rest are only fat meat, they just need to slash them. It is even possible for us to fill the number of slaves before they return."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This building..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a brand new city," the youngest of them said that he was a warlock and was involved in measuring the depth of the sea. The task, so I know more than others: "It's construction work may last for a hundred years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And we only need One year," the businessman who spoke first said: "Maybe it will be shorter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They seem to have made the right decision, although the business people know their own So dare to do this, just because it is the softest piece of flesh in the king's capital. After a hundred years of disappearance, the power of the dragons who have finally returned to Grenada is so weak that the loyalty of the slaves is not rejected. Can those beasts dare to fight against a Grinada? That's ridiculous. If they really dare to do something, even the black-haired prince can't leave a hair that belongs to them from the law of Grenada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, of course, in this world, many things are broken on "but", "Kremar is leaving, yes," Gray said: "But I am still there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to ask the gray robes that have a top-level suite in the Warlock Tower of Grenada. Did His Royal Highness really hand over these things to him, or to raise any doubts, or a famous dragon who might not be spared the inquiries and attempts, anyway, those who are kneeling in the palace and the coast The shadow disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grey robe was once again touched by himself. He felt that he was really a good teacher who had never had a good time, let alone the seventy-seven islands, plus Gray. Nada, plus Azores, White Tower or Bibi Dyke, and no other tutor can do better than himself - not only to worry about his disciples, but also to help him take care of him. Little pets coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you from?" The succubus asked, gently licking the knees of the gray robe with his tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Seventy-seventh Islands," Gray Robe said, while busy with the heap of stuff like a transparent mucus, adding the potion, wrapped in it, Rosa Pastor Dad looks like a small beetle hidden in amber, his body is demolished by the devil, and the flames are bitten, missing a lot of internal organs, bones, skin... If you think that kind of thing will still have If you save him is not a gray robe, then unless someone is willing to pray for him the most powerful magic, or he has been running on the mourning for a few days ago to chase the devil and the devil. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferke Hill licked his lips, she knew that the pastor had not fallen, at least not completely degraded, his soul glowed in the ugly body, For the succubus, it is like hanging a piece of delicious meat in front of a hungry beast, but she also knows that the gray robe will not allow her to eat too much - she can't estimate the bottom of the gray robe, and she can't be sure of herself. Whether she can defeat him, she said that she is not harmed by her own, so she can only turn around at his feet like a kitten that only asks for food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
