			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are extras written by the request of the Queen of Aquarius.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before attaching a foreigner--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main priest of the red dragon god Kremar’s main sorrow . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you bothering about things?" asked his subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think... my master's title prefix is ​​not... a little problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The God of the Red Dragon," his subordinate repeated: "This is a great title..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem is that the god of the red dragon is the former Ruidi," said the priest of the main sacrifice: "Of course, it is a false god, but because of her sake, there are many people who pray to us for a lot... fertility?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"呃..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, change to - deep sea sticky blister. Dreadful. Creepy. Dull venom. Plague metamorphosis. Greedy tentacles. Everything can't be... God, what do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "How? Or add chaos. Vomit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a while, the pastor’s subordinates carefully reminded: "This name can be said It is impeccable, as long as you hear it, you can tremble! People are shocked! Just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those fools can...remember Do you live..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Therefore, Kreima still wants to thank the literacy rate that is not popular enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the readers for their inspiration for the book review. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is the text...maybe not so positive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Cataclysm, the elves Their interactions with humans have become close, but this is not to say that they have become amiable, and both Keriben and Kreima are deeply immersed in the darkness of human nature, and never intend to test humanity, given the plane After the reset, the human country has all become a term in memory. The countries re-established around the Silver-crowned jungle and the Jade Forest Island have elves and half-elves as managers and rulers. Series regulations and laws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law of the elves is not only effective for the elves and their people, but also for other humans, or non-human countries. No one has ever protested, the elves The response is: "You obey my laws, I also abide by your laws, you don't want to obey... I can't follow them." Then they lifted the longbow and pinched the casting material - the number of elves certainly couldn't Compared with human beings, they are not warriors or mages, not masters or pastors. They are not priests. They may be magical and double-educated. After the disaster, they are all soldiers. After measuring each country, they found that their thighs may not be elf. The thick arm (of course the metaphor) finally made a rather sensible choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, in the human country, there are too many things that do not conform to the values ​​and outlook of the elves. If the elves are to abide by human laws, then at least There is still a chance to ask for help and save. If not, do you hear the crying of those idiots? Seriously, it is quite nice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, people are greatly surprised that the most frequently cited in the Elf Law is not the ones about faith, money, land... but... Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marriage Law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some guys who are trying to play with elf emotions (especially those who first came out to travel) immediately fell down because of the elves’ marriage laws, and The elves’ long lives, the crimes they committed can be traced back hundreds of years, and the elves have invoked some of the human law. In some regulations, the guilt that individuals cannot afford will be spread to their families and even Family - sometimes the king will be held accountable. If he is an official or a mage who is worshipped by the royal family, the pastor will not mention it. They never know that the god of the elf, the god of life, is still so A gossip and rapper guy - they will be thrown down by the gods directly punished or even expelled! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves will not expect to be resurrected as humans, and their cleansing of the mind and body is still well preserved. But if the child is born by the elf, the custody must be attributed to the elf, the father needs to give support, no access, as for After the little half-elf grows up, if the father is still alive, is it willing to go to see all the little half-elf himself? The maintenance fee may be more than the party's income. The elves have a very detailed account book, but the cost is amazing, but the people who saw it have to say that this is very reasonable - for example, all the little half-elves until the year before the special drink is in the human kingdom Only the royal family members and the caster have the fountain of life that they are trying to buy, but just as the elves don’t care whether you take the flowers or raise the grass or experiment with the medicine, the elves take it to feed the offspring and don’t let others else, and the elves The price on the books has been quite favorable. At the very least, those warlocks and mages will definitely see jealousy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to support payments, there are corresponding medical expenses - perhaps after a Cataclysm, the spirits of the elves are much stronger than the original, just Because of the mere spiritual damage, I was unable to extricate myself. In the end, there were few elves who were depressed and died. Or, according to Kremar’s proposal, the priests of Afra, the god of love and beauty, marriage and fertility, mainly The psychologists have played an important role here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a king he was sentenced for maliciously playing the elves’ emotions (even if he went to each sanctuary to pray for sacrifices and sent his own army and the wizard to try to confront Those violent elves are useless, and the three generations of the king after him are crying for his civil compensation and maintenance costs after the internal library...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole continent... has become much quieter - the elves say this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when Kerry, the king of the jungle, and Kremar, who is being guest, heard that...and there was a marriage case about the elves, they It is also very surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to mention, it not only happened, but the parties also ran to the Silver Crown jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry and Kremar When I arrived at the Gray Ridge, the parties to the case had already arrived, standing at the two ends of the venue, as if they were irrelevant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon seeing one of the parties, Kerry would have shouted: "Kelebril!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think some adults still remember, Kellebriel, the daughter of Perant and Ruiwen, who almost lost her father when she was still in her mother’s stomach. After the disaster, Perant and Ruiwen returned to the foot of the god of life, Angris. At that time, Kerry and Kremar, who grew up watching her, became her guardian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelebril is as beautiful as her mother, but her character is completely with Perant, rigorous to some stereotypes, and other in government affairs. The talent that the elf lacked, from the very beginning, she began to assist Kerry to deal with the affairs of Elf Wang Ting. For this reason, she almost missed her adult travel. If it is not the urging of Kerry, and the needs of the government, She may not be able to leave the jungle for a thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another party, when he saw Kremar, he immediately bent down and bowed, "Your Majesty!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it was a Dragon Warlock, and the bloodline was pure. He was before the Cataclysm, even earlier. When Red Dragon Greed was still raging on the mainland, he decided to follow Kremar. People, he is very rare, red dragon descendants who are not interested in power and lust, killing, only interested in knowledge and magic. At that time, the lich thought he would choose to turn into an undead, but at that time the gray torrent A lot of things have gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world gave him a stern look, although he is also very willing to take care of those who follow themselves from very early, but if he really hurts Kellebriel, sorry, he is still on the side of the elf. After all, the Dragon Warlock is longer than Kellebril, both in terms of age and qualifications. He should take responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who will tell me what happened?" After Kerry Ben and Kremar took the seat, the king of the jungle asked, and the soul of the other world He gave Kellebril a comforting look, but he strangely found that Kellebril's look is not so much sad, but rather awkward, and a little bit... guilty...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please allow me to talk about it." The Dragon Warlock stepped forward and the elves looked at Kellebriel. Kellebriel shook his head and agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I and Kellebriel met three years ago." The warlock looked at Crimall: "Your Majesty, right in your Cree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Kyreben exchanged a look with Kremar, when Kellebriel did go out for her late adult tour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We were not very happy when we first met," the warlock said. "For just some reason, we have to work together for a while, at In the process, we..." He paused here - the expression here, the soul of the outside world really didn't want to classify it into shy, but there seems to be no other option: "We have each other Some understanding, after that, Kellebriel asked me for a request from my peers, I... I promised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the opposite world frowned uneasy, He seems to smell something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have been together for ten years, though, we are one warlock and one elf, but after we are familiar, we find that the other party is missing each other. Part of it.” The warlock said in a creepy, gentle tone: “The feeling is hard to describe... it’s the seawater that blends into the sand, the breeze that passes through the flowers, or the morning light that touches the cheeks. In the daytime, we ride On a horse, walking with arms crossed; at dusk, we share a nut and chat at the campfire; at night, we squint under the stars, she sleeps on my shoulders, I kiss her The long hair is sleeping.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been looking for each other in the noisy city, and have played hide-and-seek in the ridiculous wilderness (even here Kerry is shocked) (This adjective is not wrong) looked at Kellebriel.) We confronted the orcs side by side, and we also explored the dragon's lair. Of course, when we feel tired, we will return to my tower. In my tower She gave birth to me and arranged the casting materials. I cooked the laundry for her, and changed some tricks to make her happy (this is the turn of Krymar's horror) - sometimes, we sit quietly in my In the study, reading scrolls and paperwork, sharing each other's views. At that time, no matter how boring the words, it became interesting... What a wonderful day... Of course," he looked at the mercy with pity. Rimal looked at it: "You probably can't understand it. After all, you have never been... um, you understand what I mean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the outside world The soul is thinking blankly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dog food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love dogs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know what is called FFF heresy interrogation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, you still say something like it... No, what happened to you later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Just in the summer of the previous year, I felt that we should have a longer relationship, so I...make a proposal." The warlock said: "She also agreed, so we went to a contract. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Contract?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," the warlock replied, pulling out of the sleeve A contract - the soul of the outside world glanced at it, not when Afra came to him once, in order to send the goddess of the potato, he said the marriage registration form and the certificate two in one. There are a lot of humans who have signed such a contract, but the elves and warlocks, he saw it for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please take a look at the years above." The warlock said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...until your love or life fades." Kerry Ben said, I don’t know why, he always feels a bit stunned, but he seems to be I have never eaten anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said the warlock, "so I asked her to continue to perform our contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But I..." said Kellebriel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You left me because you are in love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't, "Kelebril said: "I always only love you, just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it can't be compared." Warlock said sadly. "I should have guessed that you have never forgotten it, even when our emotions are the most enthusiastic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
