			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where Ferry Hill is located should have been one of the safest places in the bloody battlefield, with tens of thousands of gaps between her and the Batzheimer The devil and the devil, outside the camp, there are hundreds of high-level demons protecting her, and her body will never lack runes, scrolls and wands. When she falls asleep, she will use her own weapon - long whip, The dagger and the dagger are placed in the closest place. Of course, her biggest weapon is the succubus's special spell-like ability and her own talent, as well as the power of her father to extract from the god of wealth, Woking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What worries her is that no matter how threatening she is, Wei Yin is not willing to tell her when he will put the devil into their camp. Let her always be in the anger of uneasiness, she executed two hunting spiders who intended to flatter her, and a smashing Fro demon, and constantly pressed her hand on her long whip, with strict The harsh sight was late, the dragon master who was said to be betraying her in the plan and piercing the sword into her chest - but she must admit that in the tight atmosphere, he was as cold and slightly tired as ever. She had some wonderful comforts, she was eager to see him, and wanted to kill him when she saw him. This is very abnormal. Ferry Hill fantasizes that he will use his whip to hold his neck before he pulls out the sword, let him suffocate and die, he will become a beauty in her house. And the powerful demon, indestructible, loyal, at any time obey her orders to annihilate any enemy who dares to scorn her. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that will not wait until the end of the bloody battle, even if it is Ferry Hill, dare not intentionally shake her father, the authority of the Uzbek Prince Grazite ——She anxiously recalls every word that Wei Yin said, if Wei Yin did not stop her from killing the black dragon, is it that, from a certain aspect, the ownership of Kreima has been handed over by Graz In her hands - she licked her teeth, intoxicated to think, maybe this is a reward, if she did what Glazt wanted her to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked out of the tent, and before she almost shouted the name, a strong wave of awakening her from the illusion of screaming, the succubus shouted , launched a rune, this rune will illuminate the protective spell in the tent - the magic of the silver-blue light flowing on the surface of the bloody tent, occasionally bursting out of the dark flame, representing the fact that it has received an attack - the succubus The heart calmed down and waiting was indeed an anxious thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the tent has a bumpy top, and then there are only three moments of heartbeat, and the raised part becomes sharp like a sword, Ferrych I thought I heard a tearing sound, but it might not. The protective spell completely collapsed in the final blow, and the black shadow that covered the sight of Ferry Hill fell and hit the ground. The sound even alerted the demons who are fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a chain demon, but it looks more like a descendant of the king of squirming, he squats in place, letting the demons attack like a shower - Just in a flash, this huge body like a hill burns up, whether it's a wing, a membrane wing, or a scale and a back shell, everything is in the whistling sound of a flame. It was black, and the filthy smoke rose into the air, emitting a pungent stench—but when a male sorcerer lowered his arm, a tentacle that didn’t know where to come from grabbed his foot tightly. He dragged him into the flames. He screamed and prayed for help from others, but only saw the demons who were in the same dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not just a deformed chain demon. This is an elite squad of the devil. These powerful devils fall to the side of Ferry Hill without warning. When the chain devil attracts the attention and attack of the demon, they have summoned the most to summon. With the most powerful devil, such power is enough to compete with a quarter of the legion, and at this time, the Batzo hybrids seem to have got a signal to start attacking at all times, even worse. Yes, the Legion led by Felix Hill also began to attack the devils to attack their companions. Ferry Hill could hardly believe his eyes, she screamed, mocked and intimidated, but had no effect, the devil The step by step, the original strong line of defense is like a bridge that has been pulled out of an important pillar, crumbling, and will collapse at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She flies into the air and then falls abruptly, and when the demons are confused, the burning arrows instantly occupy their horizons...they are Such a rapid, such intensive, it is such a dazzling, covering the entire high platform, after the glare of the light, revealing the figure of the male actor, the bloody and death brings the feeling of quickness, let their beautiful face Distorted - and when the surviving demons have not yet stood up, their throats are suddenly torn, and the filthy blood splashes into the sky, and the hell cat, which can hide in the light, flies for a while. Invisible killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
