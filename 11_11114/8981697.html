			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 148th chapter of the team (sixteen)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The concave corner" in the village I have only spent less than a century here, but in their hearts, it can be said that they are their second hometown. In the eyes of children, they will be treated by the villages surrounded by trees and streams. The only home, so although bloodthirsty bats are constantly coming in, they are not willing to leave at the beginning, until more and more people are attacked, serious injuries and deaths occur, and some people want to leave temporarily. - The followers of Ilmot stopped them. He could not tell these mortals that the "concave corner" had been regarded as a sacrifice by an evil existence. He was able to be flat, but he also saw many worthy poets. In the scene, he knows that under the crush of fear and despair, even mortals will make incredible evil things - when they find that they can't escape the shadow cast by death, the darkness in the heart will be Being released to the fullest extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He prayed in front of the statuette of Ilmot, his eyes almost invisible, and his ears were occupied by rumbling noises. He couldn't feel it even on the cold stone floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A villager rushed into the church, "Priest!" he shouted: "Priest! Look outside...the gods are on, the benevolent Almaty! What's wrong with you?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor is still strong after the adventurers leave, although he is no longer young, but still has black The hair and the muscles that bulged, and now, what the villagers saw was a weak old man whose body was as thin and fragile as the leaves after the autumn. The oversized priest robe hung on his raised shoulder, his The turbid eyes are like water mixed with clay, and the fingers that protrude are like dead branches of a root. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Berry?" Pastor said, he still remembers that a boy in the village had a big and sharp voice: "I can’t see you, you come. Tell me, what happened outside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong with you?" Berry carefully held his arm, he felt the priest could When he lifts it up, he is so light. Is it cursed or poison that causes his flesh and blood to evaporate in the blink of an eye? "Who is cursing? Or are you eating and drinking toxic things?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me what's outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think..." Berry hesitated for a while - he felt that the pastor needed more rest now. Or praying to Ilmot, he looks dying, and he insists that the priest sit on a wooden pier: "Well, the priest. The wood outside suddenly collapsed, it’s terrible, I was just outside, I watched it collapse, like the fermented bread made by my mother. Just a blink of an eye, those trees, I have three high, no, four of the five tall trees have all sunk, just Like the mud towers made by children, they sink down, that is, a few breaths, and I can't even see their treetops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "And then?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to your instructions, I did not get out of the thorns. But a few disobedient boys went, their mother caught They can't catch them," he felt the priest grabbed his hand in turn. "How are they?" The priest asked, "Have they been hurt? Are there any fog, bats, and swamps?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No fog, no bats," Berry said. "There are swamps, they The next son sank, but it’s weird. They suddenly disappeared, just as there was no trace of it when they appeared. The kids were covered with grasshoppers and locusts. When I ran, they were burning. The branches were hot one by one. I ran out of the distance and could hear the sound of their call."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor’s face floated for a short while The joy, "Take me to your father." He said that Berry's father and priest had learned to read and write. He was also one of the few people in the village who could talk to outsiders. He was still a carpenter. The blacksmith, quite prestigious in the village - the followers of Ilmot did not know whether the adventurers had removed the unknown red robe or gray robe. But as far as the current situation is concerned, the restrictions imposed by the evil caster have been broken. He wants to urge the villagers to leave here as soon as possible - if in the past, he can try to convince them, but now He had previously prayed to the benevolent Ilmot, asking him to give shelter and help to those brave people, to expel evil spirits, to smash evil laws, to restore peace and tranquillity in the land, and to this he is willing to dedicate his all-he Health, his life, his hopes, and Ilmot promised his prayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may die in the next moment, he must negotiate with Berry’s father before returning to the foot of Ilmot, ask him to leave with the villagers, go to the nearest A city and inform the temple of Ilmot or other gods of goodness what happened here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swamp falls down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the drive of the half dragon, they pulled out from the periphery of the village and returned to the dark underground palace, where the creatures contained in it were falling. When the cave was dissolved, the magic was removed and the original shape was restored. Kreima saw the rubber gel wrapped in a layer of skin. It had recovered to the original one-half size and was swaying. The head (if the raised part is the head) is four times "looking out", and its impurities are more than when the lich sees it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar once again broke a wand, and the spells it cast protected their group and gave them a valuable breathing space. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-long punched on the transparent barrier, the barrier swayed but did not disappear, and his eyes showed a bit of pity, if he knew the caster With so many precious scrolls and wands, he should have killed the latter in the first place, taking away his pocket, and he can also hide in his father - his father is an old man. The red dragon, and his mother is a succubus. When his injury becomes weak, it is not very comfortable to choose the lava caves in the volcano where his father lives. It is also difficult to get from him. What kind of benefits will be gained, otherwise he will not choose to set up a place on the spot and want to treat himself with the life of a mortal; but to choose the bottomless abyss of his mother, it is even worse, an injured Half devil half dragon is there for a delicious breakfast, lunch or dinner, even his mother will not be under the temperament, half dragon is originally she is to lure the dragon to produce bait in order to enhance her strength. But she didn't expect half a dragon Vitality is so tenacious, he is from Chifeng between her escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swamp is tumbling under his feet, and the half dragon admits that the black hair caster with the elf's bloodline is right. He is a bit careless, thinking that a white robe The lichs they destroyed could not leave too much power - he was worried that he could only find some souvenirs in this ruin that were better than nothing. But here he encountered an amazing number of golems and grievances, as well as locust mage with the shard's soul shards as the core, he destroyed them, but he was torn by the enchant's curse on the spell book. Body and soul - he avoids casting powerful spells as much as possible. In order to avoid the occurrence of cracks, the soul is once again hit hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if only the body, the body derived from the devil and the dragon can still kill these people, half-long smile, waiting for this spell to fail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This smile has been retained until he is stabbed in the spirit of a clear and powerful mind, and the pain has swept his brain and body. He fell straight down and fell into the filthy sticky mud. At the next moment, several muddy monsters were burned into pots by the flames of half-dragons. The mixed hybrids struggling out of the mud were angry. Screaming, the bats and the venomous moths slap their wings in a staggered way, and the huge caves are filled with the ominous whirring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protective spell cast by the wand has expired, but Kremar has recovered, more correctly, it is the soul of the outside world who succeeded the Lich, after ten A few small (hours) rests. It is now energetic, clear-headed, and can continue to fight with the poor half-devil half-dragon to complete a fierce battle, but the lich who is not so anxious to meditate is not prepared to spend time on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We may be able to retreat all over the body, he reminded, but don't forget that there are Kerry Ben and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half dragon jumped in the air, his wings cut a bursting sound in the air, he was in extreme anger, "You can't cast spells." "He said loudly: "You should have exhausted your spells!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am sure." The soul of the outside world is innocent. Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said, after the semi-dragon instantly disappeared. The alien soul accurately sends him a beam of light, half-dragon screaming, and he spurts the flames of the caster's friend, when the caster casts a spell. He jumped onto a hanging stalactite and broke it, pointing to the most vulnerable of several people, a pastor throwing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of view of the costume, it is difficult for the half dragon to distinguish whether the human woman worships the god. She has not launched any attacks since she appeared. Rescue. But keep praying, as time goes by, the part that belongs to the devil makes the half dragon anxious - he always feels that she can't let her finish her prayer, half dragon wants to ignore it, he is not a pure devil, to the pastor The blow is not so sensitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——How are you prepared? The alien soul asked, and then he cast a spell that allowed the bat and the moth to blindly fight each other. The moth's mouthpiece chewed the bat's membrane wings, the scales burned their noses; and the bat's teeth pierced them. The abdomen sucks the slurry from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--I do not know! Mei Mi shouted in her heart that she was not used to using telepathy. The thief took her off and Birdwin opened a stone that flew to her, the stone as big as her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The longer you drag on, the worse it is for us. The soul of the opposite world says that my spells, scrolls and wands are limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Can't you kill him directly? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——A half dragon plus a half devil, even if he was injured, the soul of the outside world said, unfortunately, still can't, in fact, he slightly Ramp, we should start with the goblin, not the leapfrog here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I agree very much, the thieves intervened in a busy schedule, saying that the small meeting they started in the martyr determined his work, except for the great Dangerously destroys the squad (although it only puts the rune in the position specified by the caster), all he has to do is keep his life with Mei Mi – both Bywin and Kerry Ben have multiple side-by-side experience, this time. The same is true, they have a tacit understanding, and Birdwin has spare time to rescue Gülen and Plum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Export your magic, the soul of the outside world is gentle, and it is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I beg you not to increase my pressure! Mei Mi shouted silently, but she only hesitated for a while, then closed her eyes and extended her hands - the thief put a box thrown by Kreima into her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The box slammed open, and there was a little evil in it, the lowest level in the endless abyss except the unformed soul worm, it is very Ugly, like a shackled shackle, with a pair of scorpions, dotted with sarcoma wings, has a face, and when you see Pastor Fro, it will reveal a wretched smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priest Froo throws the prayers he has earned on it, she is not very sure, because she has never prayed for this spell before. Luo's pastor is good at healing, so he can treat some of the wounds left by the rude lover, or another magic, to enhance each other's charm, or something else... that can give people a boost. So, let them come up with more gold coins, but no one will let Pastor Fro to fight, even if this is just a little evil, it is ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
