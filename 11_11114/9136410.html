Since that person left the gray ridge, the white face never has I have eaten such delicious fish.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s nose screamed sadly for a while, but as the sun began to become sparse, the white face woke up because of a familiar smell, if It’s a personal class. I think I’m still in my dreams, but as a otter, the white face doesn’t think too much about the so-called reality and fantasy. It believes in its own nose, so it doesn’t hesitate to stand up and wear it. After a bush of bilberry, I ran through half a small maple forest and came to the edge of the river bank - this is not the edge of the Starlight River, but a tributary that splits through the silver-crowned jungle. This tributary is better than those The wide and deep squats of the cognac in the winter, it is precisely because of this, the river swims countless longest palms in all seasons.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small fire on the edge of the river’s sandy shore. It’s not others who are grilling small fish on it. It’s Kerry’s. In the silver crown jungle, he does not have to face the enemy and evil. His look is calm and calm, just with a little heavyness that cannot be eliminated... Since he was brought back from the starlight river, the white face knows that it is waiting That person won't come back - for the elves, the life of the otter is almost a blink of an eye, but the wisdom of the white face makes it know that some people will come back, while others will never, in it In the low nest, it saw a lot of laughter, but more tears - although Kerry did not cry, but the otter can feel that he is very painful, this pain is not from the sword or the arrow, it Just like a chronic disease, it is not death, it is a slower and longer torture than death. Many times, you can even ignore it, but when it is silent, its screams will continue like the ripples on the water. The earth has passed through the depths of the soul<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are fat"Kerry said that while holding the water that looks like a deep philosophical question, the heavy weight makes him feel satisfied, and there is a silky shiny fur: "Yes," Elf Ranger. Said: "Autumn is coming soon," he put the otter on his lap and slowly licked its hair: "You have to eat enough to spend the whole winter.In fact, not only the otters, but the elves are also collecting nuts, fruits, fish and other things that can be eaten, although in the harsh winter, in order to obtain meat and fat that can resist extreme cold, they still Inevitably want to hunt, but if you can, the elves still want to reduce this consumption as much as possible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fire, it is a polished slate, the small fish on the slate have their tails lifted, and this smell attracts the white face of the water.It made a turn in Kerry's arm, and extended his nose to the fire, sniffing with a sigh of relief, and the smoke poured into his nose, causing it to sneeze several times: "Not yet When?Kerry Ben said, sighing, this is his second time to bake the dried fish, as he walked across the river and saw the little fish jumping brightly from the water - he didn't know himself Is it necessary to do this? In the jungle, you have always had difficulty seeing the physical fire, but he still did it. He missed the smell and the smell, although he didn’t know if he could successfully replicate it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him think of nothing unexpectedly about what he and Yadel had said, and Perant showed him the information - Albino The mage’s guess is correct, dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their little creek does have the blood of the dragon, or rather, there is, he The blood in the body is even the most noble of all the dragons, and he has been acknowledged again by his father and Red Dragon Greed, and has the corresponding status and honor, but perhaps very Superfluous, Kerry is very worried about his current situation, he just has to regret it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry admitted that his mind was in a mess at that time, he didn’t know how to face Crimal, and he was almost treated as a child. The half-elf who cares, if he only has the current identity, Kerry would not be surprised or hostile, but the facts he speculated were so terrible, Kreima is not only a dragon, half Elf, he was once a lich! And under what circumstances can a lich get back to the living body? In the vast Wanweilin, unfortunately, Kerry has seen this ancient and lonely law - and he just passed it, how is it possible? Even if a caster can be called good, it is absolutely impossible for him to continue to maintain a good position before, during and after becoming a lich, because any one of the converted spells is extremely evil. Evil is almost impossible to redeem – and, since he has decided to become a lich, it means that he will no longer maintain a human heart, the blood of the undead is the crystallization of negative energy, and their soul is bottomless. The projection of the abyss, they may behave like a good man at some point, but all his actions must have a purpose, and this purpose must be closely tied to his interests.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that all that would be false? No, he doesn't think so. Even the most embarrassing devil can't hang the camouflage mask on the body all the time. The true, passionate, compassionate and gentle feeling he feels is true. And some of the questions that Kerry had neglected or tolerated before were answered—what is it, and many people, for example, the teachers and colleagues of Yadell, brought back to this world? This law clearly states that the body of the redemption lich is made up of positive energy. So, is he forced? Kerry did not think so. If he said that he was saving himself because he was the son of Ingwi, what did the priests of Rosada say? Can they bring him any benefits? Even Kerry had never thought that Yadell could regain Rosa's favor in such a short period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the white-faced beating made Kerry could not continue to think about it. He looked down and saw that the small fish on the slate was about to burn off. It’s rare for the elves to clumsyly pick up small fish with branches and put them on the prepared leaves, and the otters are supervising them. This has done a lot of things that people can’t do (including and not limited to the heirs of the king of the jungle. The creature of the face slaps his tail very unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is yours." Kerry Ben said that while pushing the leaves to the otter, the otter sniffed and put on a serious face, howling A few times. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you can't have salt, you can't have sugar," said Kerry Ben. "Otherwise you will be bald, maybe It’s not just the head.” Druid said that the leeches can’t taste sweet and salty, but the white face is obviously excluded. Obviously, it’s more for those small fish with fine salt and honey. Interested, one will be towed one or two if you don't pay attention. But there is a small animal like the otter that eats salt and sugar and then loses hair, or Kremar said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before leaving the jungle, Yadell asked Keri if he wanted to say something. What is he going to say? Kerry wanted to, he hoped that Kremar would be able to come back, return to the Grey Ridge, and return to their side, but he could only talk about small fish in the end. Leaving from the Ranger and leaving Kremar has already explained one thing. Although they are still under the same starlight, this child has decided to go to another long and rugged road. He has no companions on this road. Only the enemy is full of crisis and danger, but this is his own choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry would only hope that the end of this road is not an abyss of darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly chicken has escaped from the orc’s tribe for six days, seven days or ten God, her memory is not very good, but she is still a temperamental, strong body, the companions around her are decreasing, and increasing - the merchants are like dumping the slaves to the Whistling Plain, but in Among these merchants, the caravans belonging to Grenada or Dylan are of course the most rigorous and dangerous. Their slaves have almost no chance to escape, but some still only see profitable and want to take the opportunity to take a pro The merchants of the goddess Fangze participated in it - they were not able to obtain Dylan's license, but Dylan has already traveled to the kingdom, just like the former Byrdwin, once a year, returning from the king. Gifts, supplies, and awards, Dylan did not want to leave, but the son of Norman was unfortunately The king’s emotions are in an unstable state. In addition to his insatiable sacrifice to Greedy, he is constantly changing and killing his officials. In his opinion, everyone may be associated with Dylan. He used to be the dearest nephew. Now the competitors are connected to want to murder him, and the sudden "outing" of Princess Ang’s princess has stimulated his most sensitive nerve. He not only put the princess under house arrest. Three messengers were also dispatched to ask Dylan to return to the king to report to him in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, almost everyone knows that this is just an excuse. This time, the glimpse should have been in the spring, when the lilacs are in full bloom, or the lords of Thunderbolt will To be exhausted on the road between Thunder and the Kings, even if Dylan is a mage, he can use the power of magic to transmit, but after entering the scope of the king, the transmission-like spells fail, he can only rely on the horses - and Not too far from winter. Dudu3();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunderbolt people are worried, the soldiers simply do not want to go against the orders of the host of Dylan's stay - they are indeed confused, but The host who Dylan stayed in was a Marquis. His greed for money was like a stinking pouch that was always filled with dissatisfaction. No matter who blocked his way of collecting money, he would let that person die and be extremely The painful death, the license flew out of his hands like a snowflake - all the people who had the courage to dare to ignore the license they issued had been driven out of Thunder Fort by Dylan, and the merchants took out a box. Gold, of course, they have to get more boxes of gold, and this time the beasts are extraordinarily generous, generous to the merchants when they walk through the martyrdom, throwing silver coins instead of copper coins on the ground, as soldiers Reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
