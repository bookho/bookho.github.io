			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich walked over and shook the hand of the granddaughter’s daughter, the little hand was cold, but still very soft, she was in the father’s arms The face is close to the mother's chest, and the lips are blue but with a sweet smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of city do you want to build?" The old warlock suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A big city rising from the sea," said the Lich. "There is a splendid tower in the middle, surrounded by tall towers, which are row upon row, waterways. As the sun shines in all directions, the bridge is like a spider web, people can walk from one room to another without touching a drop of water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It's wonderful, but it's a project that takes time and slaves, and the cost may be much longer than you expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich looks at him, "Gray Nada’s cost has never wavered itself.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes,” said the warlock: “You plunder. But standing on my side, I hope this The bigger the project, the better, the longer the better - will the Tilan people be broken up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If possible, I will follow from another Principality Get more slaves, maybe there will be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old warlock was slightly surprised, For him suddenly had a vague understanding from the words just now, but he did not mention even one word: "I have the same surname as Dagong," he said: "My death is a foregone conclusion, but I am I don't think to mourn the wasteland. I know that you are carrying a gray robe. I beg you and accept my effectiveness." He deeply said to the dark-haired dragon: "I have a lot of experience and a wealth of knowledge. After I become a ghost, I will be your most powerful arm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what it means?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" means that I will lose my dignity, freedom and my soul." Dagong’s uncle said, "But it still keeps me in this world, and I still have a lot of things to finish. There are more questions that don't get an answer.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also to make sure that the Tiran people can get a little meager hope as the Grand Duke expects, the Lich thinks, But he answered this request, he can almost believe the loyalty of this ghost Because the way of the Tiran is in his hands, if he dies or fails, then the person who succeeds him may not be able to continue to treat him in the same way as the Grenada. These slaves, for the people of Tiran, this ghost will work for him at all costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to keep your original name?" The Lich asked, after becoming a ghost, the ghost can continue to use its own name, or it can be named by the owner: "Are you still getting one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Regain one." The warlock who is about to become a ghost said that he calmly glanced at the gray robe that was called. Ms., the Necromancer has an indelible cold negative energy, she stands there, no better than the Dagong family - some ghosts will cling to the previous name, but since he is also a warlock, then he Knowing that once he is recognized by his identity, it is likely that some caster can use his or her name to control him. Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Gray robes raised her finger, the warlock was hit by a deadly spell, his soul instantly left the body, but because the gray robes were cast in advance, another The spell, although mourning the winds of the wasteland has already boasted of his body, but still failed to take his soul, he stood there, the negative energy of the outside was suddenly sucked into the room, forming a fast vortex, and finally, like The vortex of the shape of the hole is like finding a leaking hole, and suddenly injecting the lonely soul - the translucent soul becomes solid and clear in an instant, the fire of negative energy overflows from his eyes and mouth, and the blue light shines The face of the lich is illuminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It screams that the pain caused by the mutual pull of spells and mourning the wilderness has made it in a state of madness for a while, it’s going to conflict, looking for The gap between the spells, wanting to escape and kill, but a small hand crossed its body, it was shocked - it was the body of the Grand Duke,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The inside is empty, controlled by Ms. Gray Robe, the face of the ghost reveals a stun look, then sadness, then it is no longer it, but he, as a human reason, re-infuse this In the soul, he woke up: "Thank you very much." He said slowly, every syllable had to reverberate three times in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the lich said in her heart that our lady in grey robes is in a sweet love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Gray Robe quits the room after determining that the ghost has recovered its proper reason, and the Lich and Ghost signed a contract. At the time, I also signed a contract with the ghost, but before leaving Grenada, the contracts were lifted - otherwise Kelmen and Kelsey would immediately know that they had been deceived and mocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," said the ghost: "My master, what do you want me to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich did not speak, but first put a handful of shreds into the fragrant boat that was ignited when signing the contract. This is the smashing of the soul gems, the food of the ghosts, and he relies on these things to strengthen himself. The ghost took a deep breath, and in this respect, his new owner seemed to have no flaws - he was also a warlock, knowing that some bad warlocks often used various methods to deny the compensation they paid. Not to mention the award in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go and see the whistling plain." Once the undead said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Orc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Orcs, and humans," said the Lich: "Don't I am alarmed, all I need is intelligence."dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————— ——————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghosts don’t know that they will In the Wuthering Plain, I will see a scene similar to the capital of Tilan. No, it is Thunder Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slave team that runs through the entire Thunderbolt and the inner city falls into the city from the city like the sand in the hourglass, even on the walls of Thunderbolt. Soldiers who had no knowledge of the situation could not help but be scared. Before, some merchants sold human slaves as goods to the orcs. The orcs only knew how to fight and plunder. They would not cultivate or textile, let alone burn pottery and make other Necessities, some of them will buy directly from merchants, while others will buy craftsmen directly, but no matter what kind of slaves, it is difficult to spend three winters on the whistling plain. But at that time, the demand of the orcs was not high enough, and thousands of slaves passed the thunder gates of Thundersburg every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soldier suddenly stunned. He saw a face belonging to the Normans of the Highlands, and the tall body unique to the Normans. It was a life. The ugly woman, perhaps because of the extremely strong relationship, she was tied up and dragged behind the horse. Although the horse did not go very fast, she was barefooted, limping, and apparently had not rested for a long time. Her face and body have traces of rubbing on the gravel rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier instinctively wanted to put down the spear, but his arm was immediately pulled away by another soldier, "Don’t take care of this," the soldier said: "That is a slave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But she is a Norman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Man will become a slave," another soldier pushed him aside fiercely: "I said let her not!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing but," prevented his soldiers from lowering their voices and said, "This is the caravan of His Royal Highness," he said. "Hid’s Highness himself signed them. With the permit, they can sell slaves! As for the Normans in the slaves, this is not something we can care about. We can only be optimistic about ourselves now - do you want to be driven out? Maybe you are willing to follow That thief, but what about my sister? Her belly is already big, do you want her and your child to be born in the wilderness?"<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier was struggling, but he remembered his wife. According to Ou’s mother, she could touch two small heads across her thin belly. She is likely to have a pair. The child may be the daughter he expected, or the son his wife expected. He hesitated and finally quieted down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait more," the soldier said indifferently and sadly: "You are used to it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businessman who was delayed by the soldiers’ dispute did not urge them. On the contrary, he sat on the horse and looked at this interesting dispute with great interest. The Norman still loves himself very much. Compatriots, especially those newcomers. But recently the Norman slaves were indeed a little more, so much that they couldn't use these sinners to seduce, but what about it? The exchange of slaves for the gems and pyroxes of the orcs was personally promised by His Royal Highness Dylan. Haha, His Royal Highness Dylan, he is already one of the heirs to the throne. Especially after the unfortunate death of the son of Norman, Dylan, who has been stationed in Thunderbolt and has achieved a big victory, suddenly jumped into Norman. In front of people's eyes, if he can get more victories, then his merits can completely lay a ladder to the throne. Dudu3();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
