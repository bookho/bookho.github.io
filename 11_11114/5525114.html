			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My friend," said Master Demon at the other end of the mirror: "I thought you would know the elf better than me. You have half the blood of the elf." They have been with them for seventy years," he carefully controlled his smile so that it did not seem to be biased towards ridicule or sympathy, lest this stubborn and narrow half-elves angered him: “The elves have always been like this,” he said. “They like beautiful and energetic things, and there are people who have nothing to blame. This is their nature.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He smiled slightly: "I didn't see the Master of Purimal, but according to my brother Yadel, he is a near-perfect young man, smart, powerful, handsome and pure, and belongs to The black hair of the Aya spirit, in this case, Fenway, who can not be attracted to him? Such a person, how easy it is to fall in love with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking for you not to discuss this." Fenway said<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," Demon said. "Of course." He did not remind him to complain to him at the beginning that Ilva was too close to Crimdale. It was Fenway, who seemed to understand what it was like: "I am sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter."<br /><芬 &&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenway said dryly, the slender fingers different from humans caught the edge of the table tightly, and he turned weakly and looked at a silk carpet on the wall. In this way, we can stop the words of Demon echoing in our ears. This silk carpet covering almost the entire wall is the work of Ilva, which took her ten years of empty space. What it presents is In the depths of the silver-crowned jungle, the smog is dissipating, the light spots in the jungle, the silver-crowned trees are stretched with dense branches and leaves, the countless vines are entwined and hang from the branches, like the accounts, and the iron walls, low and thorny The shrubs are intertwined with the hustle and bustle of the trees, and the transparent and shining streams are moving under their shelter - throughout the picture In the upper left, almost the silver-white silk thread of the same color as the canvas weaves a contour that can only be said to be faintly visible. The careless human may even ignore or misunderstand the projection of the distant mountain, but Fenway knows that it is the elves. The corner of the huge hall of the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elves can never see and touch the sacred land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fenway?" Demon slightly raised his voice, and his brother’s return disrupted his plan, leaving him with less time. He must turn all the wheels up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am listening." Fenway replied impatiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to ask," Demon kept a hypocritical and kind tone: "Did you destroy the spell book?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenway suddenly panicked, his eyes slipped uncontrollably to one side: "I still need some time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The spells recorded in it are very dangerous," Demon said with temptation: "It is equally powerful - my friend, if you are not sure - my mentor will return to the White Tower in the near future, maybe we This book should be handed over to him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Fenway shouted: "I know what to do, just do it again." In the last two small experiments, I was able to determine how to completely destroy it - I exchanged those materials with you - you know!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes," Demon said. "I know, but to be honest, this book was originally a mentor. If he asks me, I can't refuse him."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two days, up to three days." Demon said: "Try hard, leave time for you." Not much, respectable Fenway Master." After that, he went to Fenway for a gentleman's ceremony, the picture darkened, the mirror gradually returned to silvery white, the blood was gone, just like it was absorbed by it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two days, or three days." Fenway repeated, his hands trembled to pick up the Mithril mirror, and took the book from the drawer blocked by the spell. The spell book, frantically reading one of the spells...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finger He is dead, he is a half-elf, with pale gold long hair and emerald eyes like Singer, except for the ear, in appearance, he is the same as the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was strangled by his neck and the throat was deeply sunken, but this was not the only fatal injury. Someone cut his The chest, taking away his heart and part of the internal organs, and most of the blood, these are done when he is still alive, the technique is clean and clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilva once saw a similar approach, on the victim of a red robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenway tries to enter the eternal wasteland, the land that the soul must pass, to find the consciousness of the dead, to ask for details, but surprisingly Failed - he didn't get any response. This situation shouldn't have happened. Even if there is only one piece left, the soul will respond to the call of the people before it is swallowed, assimilated and selected. This means not only It is the body, and the soul of the victim is destroyed in the most complete way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like the usual practice of gray robe. In order to avoid tracking and revenge, they often do it, and they can accumulate some money and food for themselves. But no matter which one, it undoubtedly indicates that sin and disaster have once again extended their claws to this quiet and beautiful mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager of Gray Ridge is a druid, he summoned his animal companion, not so surprised to know that the birds and beasts in that area have escaped or Death - A raven tells the manager confusingly that it is nothing else to drive them away. It is a dark and cold atmosphere, like a swamp, a grave or a human execution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who was he with before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Kremar." The elf answering this question is a bit hesitant. The black-haired caster has the shortest time in Gray Ridge, but he also gets the people they trust and love in the fastest time. No one wants to believe that he will be the murderer or Fenway. It is an accomplice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what does Crimmar see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is The lich first noticed the cold air that made the animals restless, and then the blood and death. He was familiar with the things. The soul of the outside world quickly rushed to the poor Fingal after being warned, but in the lich. After telling him that the victim had completely died, he stopped in time, for a while, but it was enough to ensure that the first one would not be there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I thought you would insist on retaining the honor of the first screamer. The lich is sarcasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I don’t know if you have seen our movie, the soul of the outside world said that although the details are not very clear, I know if someone is stupid Standing on a crime scene, the body was covered with blood, and the body was turned down. In general, someone would point to him and yell at the murderer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Ha, it seems that you are not so reassured about these elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Trust is not for testing, the soul of the opposite world retorts, if you can keep yourself clean, why bother to jump into the mud and then come to the expense What about the whitewashing? The murderer may have escaped when you explained and explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager recalled all the half-elves and elves, but the most important patrol work of Gray Ridge must continue. He strengthened the strength of each team and shortened the patrol. The route and the number of people added to the vertical, even so, there is still a second victim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Fingal, he was thrown to the ground, but he saw that he had been suspended, barely rebellious, lost his heart, lungs and most Blood, Finwitt can't find his soul either. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This person is very familiar with Gray Ridge," said the manager. "He knows the route of our patrol and the interval between crossings, so it can be so short. Time to carry out his evil deeds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said," Fenway said, both hands were in the robes: "The outsiders will only give gray The ridge brought destruction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough," Il said. "Kremar’s body is the same blood as us." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the Aya Elves, not the Singer Elves." Fenway responded coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he has never been patrolled," Il said angrily. "When the second person was killed, he was still thousands of feet away." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think it is difficult for a wizard to prepare a transfer within a hundred miles?" Fenway said: "And he can completely close one in advance." Or multiple accomplices, he only needs to give the route and time. After all, he is so good at observing and has a remarkable memory - just like you praised, he never lost his way in the gray ridge, because he remembers each tree The characteristics of the trees that once passed him; he is so flattering, just a few dozen days, who else did not dance with him in the moonlight, sang songs, drank wine, tasted sweet Candy? They are simply unprepared for him, just like you, Ilva, I believe that if we can dig up his stomach, we will find the rich and wonderful secrets like the dragon treasure."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
