The silver-blue film, the first to lightly jump out of the "door" is the thief Gülen, who looks around and finds himself in a small, densely-gardened courtyard, a Norman in the Highlands is not so common. The olive tree covered the south corner of the courtyard. It was densely leafy and lush, full of fragrant white flowers. The thief's sudden visit shocked a small branch of it, and the flower fell from the top of Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gülen moves his body, letting go of the position, from the "door" out of Bedwin, Kerry Ben and plum, the black hair caster is The last one, when he came out, the "door" became faint, transparent, and then disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are we?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be confirmed that we are still in the Highlands In the territory of Man." Kerry has pointed to the marble statue used for decoration in the courtyard - the bloodthirsty orcs and the muscled tangled warriors are bravely killing each other. The weapons and armor they hold are bronze, axe and wide. The sword's blade flashes to represent the sharp cold and is active. If there are enemies invading, the owner can take them off at any time. The Elf Ranger has traveled many places, but adopting this practice and maintaining this tradition Almost only the Highland Normans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very general statue." Mei Mi said that she placed her hand on the statue, the lines of the statue were very rough, and the surface had never been more detailed. Grinding and stroking it is like stroking an untreated rock, but the shape of the orc and the warrior captures quite accurately. When someone stares at them, they even think they have heard the orcs’ crazy screams. With the warriors do not make more shouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think this would be? A demon statue, if this is a garden of the caster," Gülen said: "So your hand has long been They are smashed, priest," he said tiredly. "And we can't stand here for so long, and we can't see anyone who comes to meet us."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed to the black-eared caster: "The most important thing is that our mage will not throw us into the territory of another caster so rashly," he said reverently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry. The alien soul said in his heart that the fall of this spell is indeed uncontrollable - but if this is a caster's mansion and courtyard, then the spell will be interrupted or distorted, and we can't get here. La. But he ended up with a slight smile. Do not make redundant explanations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just an ordinary residence," Kerry's eyes can see more than Birdwin and Plum in the low light:" May belong to a retired knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is so lifeless." Mei honey muttered, really, the elf looked up and could not see A window lit by lights. It stands to reason that in every mansion, the most busy time at this time is the kitchen, because the main people will get up after dawn, so the morning meal must be prepared before this, the porridge soup needs to be cooked, and the bread needs to be baked. There are also a variety of fresh ingredients from the agreed vendors that need to be checked, and servants need more charcoal to heat the room, so say. The kitchen at this time should be bright and steamy - but the elves couldn't find anything, the heat of the fire, the aroma of the food, the noisy servants, the arguments between the vendors and the kitchen director... none, the whole courtyard and The house was trapped in a terrible silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it was abandoned." Birdwin said that although he did not think this would be the correct answer, he took the wide sword from the statue, Under the faint light, it was measured, and the original bright metal weapon quickly eroded in the hands of the fallen paladin. There was a thick dark green rust on the blade, and Baldwin only used a little bit of strength. The place where the blade and the handle were connected was pinched off, and the broken wide sword fell to the ground. Silently broken into several pieces - this is the scene that should be in the truly abandoned courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They marched along the promenade connecting the courtyard to the home, no one was touched along the way, all the rooms were empty, including the kitchen, the kitchen The equipment can be said to be fully luxurious, from clay pots. Pottery, lead pots and tin pots, iron pots, barbecue forks and knives, everything, and surprisingly, they are so quietly discarded in place, no one is stealing and Take them away. Kerry opened a pot with a half bowl of rye porridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you smelling?" Crimmar whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The smell of blood." Kerry Ben replied, it was a rotten, stinking smell, like the smell of the internal organs that had been exposed to the heat for a long time. In the courtyard, it was not obvious, almost olives. The fragrance of the flowers of the tree was completely covered, but as soon as he entered the mansion and entered the room, the bloody suffocation became thicker. Gülen also frowned, and he was very familiar with the bloody taste and sensitive to Baldwin. Also, only Mei Mei is amazed, she may just feel that the smell in the room is too turbid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry this means to give Cremari the edge of the hearth, the stove in the kitchen is large, can put two iron pots at the same time, close to the right side of the hearth In the corner, there was a thick layer of grass ash, and the color of the ash was black and uneven. "Someone is bleeding here," said the elf. "Then they covered it with ash."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than one place." Gülen said that as a thief, he can also see things in a weak place. Indeed, as he said, there are many places in the kitchen. Covered with ash, but some places were shattered by chaotic steps. "There are some traces that they didn't cover," the thief said of a dumping rattan basket. The rattan basket should have been used to hold eggs or duck eggs. Spreading a thick straw, the straw smashed into the ground, and the thief pulled the straw with his toes. Below is a yellow-white gemstone, which is a texture that is brittle, dark and easy to inhale moisture and color. Inferior stone with many natural scars, but because of the price Low-cost relationship, people often use it in the kitchen and warehouse - this piece of stone is cracked, but I don't know whether it was left before laying or laying - the crack runs through the whole stone, the thickest place The fingers are so thick, and the thinnest part can be stuffed into a piece of nail. The blood stains not only form a dark color on the surface of the stone like a gelatinous monster, but also flow into the gap. They solidify and accumulate in the gap. It seems like someone who has tried to repair this piece of stone with a bad technique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person shed so much blood, his current situation may not be very good. If the blood in the kitchen belongs to this individual. Then he should have entered the grave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the thief doing it?" Mei Mi asked in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not notice that Kerry had frowned. "The thief will not converge on his victim."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless he is interested in waiting for the next prey." Gülen said calmly: "But I don't think that a home that is not too remote will be a place where thieves will choose to stay and set traps - he walks from the portal When I came out, I looked at the outside world with a high degree of advantage. This mansion is located on the wing of a wide street, and the nearest neighbor is only separated from him by a courtyard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Let's go to the owner's room to see." Kerry Ben said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner's room is located at the deepest point of the entire mansion. On either side of the corridor connecting it there are bedrooms that may be prepared for his children and guests, but they are all empty, and in some of them, the rancid bloody smell is extraordinarily rich – the same is true for their rooms. But in addition to the more unbearable stench. They also found a living person, although he is dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to describe what this person looks like. He used to be tall and strong. Even now, his body has never been seen by Kerry. The dying person shrinks and loses water, but for the soul of the outside world, it is better to see a dry body - he is lying on the bed, wrapped in gray ramie that only the deceased will wear, holding his hands Sheets, a wide sword inlaid with gold and silver fell to the side. It can be seen that he was trying to hold his own hands and hold the hilt – just like a knight, but the terrible pain made him struggle uncontrollably – Kerry’s brooch illuminated his bed. Let everyone understand where the dirty blood is coming from - from the human body, the black blood flows out of the man's mouth, eyes, ears and nostrils, soaked in white Linen sheets and fur tweezers, wet the account, not seeing it with your own eyes, I am afraid no one will believe that a person can have so much blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei screamed and turned and fled, and Gülen also took two steps back later. Pulled up the hood on the cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give him some water." The elf said that Baldwin glanced at the door that Plum dropped, but there was no movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar will hang his hand over the patient's forehead, and the cold water hits his cheek and neck. He faintly snorted. Woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf poured some dried longan powder into his mouth. This powder resembling spirits played a refreshing role. The patient opened his eyes and he Looking at them in confusion is like a nightmare, but then he coughs up violently. More blood sprang from his mouth, which was covered with red and black pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Lung. The lich suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The fragments of the lungs, this is not an ordinary disease or injury, this is a disease, once the undead said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." The patient said in a low, almost inaudible voice, "...leave..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has also discovered this astonishing crux: "We will leave immediately," he said. "Is it only you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Here," the patient moved his mouth, as if he wanted to reveal a smile: "Only...I...but...outer..." He was immersed in a bloody eye and looked at the tent's head. "Ah..." He said: "Maybe... you have to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His line of sight solidified at this time, and the corner of his mouth was fixed. A slightly upturned position, like laughing at them, ridiculing anyone who is alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they heard a repressed scream, they quickly left the room of the deceased, right in the foyer, they met Mei Mi, the priest of Fro The hands pressed against the lips and trembling, and there was a man under her feet, and the deep red blood was flowing from under his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The endless abyss is down!" the thief shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the mansion facing the street is open, anyone can enter it, and the people inside can come out at any time - if he can, suddenly come here The uninvited guests saw dizzy, countless dead people - they fell on the street, some wrapped in gray ramie, and some were only dressed in usual clothes, the only thing that was the same All the fabrics were soaked in blood, and the cold death enveloped the entire street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of the god of death, Clauwo, walked on the street with a wheelbarrow, dressed in black robes, with hoods and masks - The mask mimics the sacred bird crow of the god of death, Kravo, the crystal of the crystal of the crystal protects their eyes, the black feathers protect their cheeks and ears, and a huge curved plaque covers their eyes. Nose and mouth, this cockroach is made from the horn of a rhinoceros, inlaid with amethyst that is said to be able to drive away toxins and diseases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are trio, one person, and two are responsible for stacking the bodies on the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
