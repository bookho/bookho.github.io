			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you bring back for us?" Red Dragon said, "Besides the burnt feathers."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We could have killed an officer..." A warlock couldn’t wait to say. But without the red dragon saying something, a gray robes that always followed the red dragon waved, an invisible giant hand grabbed him, and then threw him heavily on the ground: "I think Ms. Honglong only I want to hear what she wants." The gray robe whispered, and the cold tone made the warlock silence, as if he had never had a tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We almost killed a military officer in Longshan," the soul of the opposite world said like a parrot. After a slight sneer, he continued. "In the range of 530 feet, there are 103 soldiers, 76 in the place I can see, 27 in the wall of the city wall, three officers, five cars. Within the scope of my vision, there are nine casters, three white robes, five mages and one warlock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone reveals distrust The look, but the black-haired dragons may have the most calm look and calm tone they have seen, and people can't help but be convinced, "in such a short time?" Kelmen asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelmen may be stupid, the soul of the outside world thinks he is a bit pitiful, "someone can do something," he said amiablely. "Not to mention these things is not that difficult." He glanced at the other warlocks, "Right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlocks are not sure, but they are now There is no chance to exchange a look: "I think..." A warlock said: "The number of soldiers hidden may still need to be considered..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Difference?" Red Dragon asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it might be twenty-nine, two of which are hidden at the bottom, maybe because of this..." The warlock said, then he suddenly remembered Kreima is still their leader: "Our perspective is not the same, it may be because of the overlapping of spells, I mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough "The red dragon said, "I will listen to the rewards of others, you can leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people bowed to her slightly, from the tent I left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Do you really see so much? The lich asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-How is it possible, the soul of the outside world says - I just talk about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s now.” Red Dragon said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world glanced at the lead-black sky, the galaxy was covered by deep clouds, and the wilderness, mountains, walls, and fortress were covered by a faint gray light. Shrouded, the chilly slender rainlessly infiltrated the fur of the lion's lion's beast, the warrior's robes and the red dragon's scales - now it should be the deepest night, but the rain reflects a little faint light Let the earth shine like a glimmer of light at dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a very small spot on the wall that still flashes, although the rain is weak, but the torch is inevitably carrying a thick smoke when it is burning. People can't open their eyes, so these lights can only belong to the soldiers' sharp steel spears. It is also possible that the fluorspar pins on the chest of the officer or the mage are shining - they may be wary, maybe not, after all, people Everyone knows that the eagle lion is not able to see things in the dark, but it is clear that the red dragon does not want to alarm these humans unnecessarily before this, she, or more correctly, it raises wings in the dark, This is the signal of the attack. As the red dragon quickly ascends to the sky, all the lions and lions take off, and Kreima and his face lions and beasts are close to the wings of the red dragon. At the last moment, the dragon still remembers looking back at him and seems to be sure of his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember, you, don't let the 'mother' disappoint," Red Dragon said: "anyone." If this sentence she is not watching Crimal It might be better to say it - Kelmen is on the other side of the Red Dragon, maybe he thinks his mother will say something to himself, but no, there is the leader of the Dragon Thorn, which is to take responsibility for Austal. The red dragon's moody unlucky one, I don't know where to get an eagle lion body beast - but since this happened after Kremar temporarily unloaded the position of the Dragon Tooth Legion, he certainly Don't worry about whether there is a knight in his army. The thief, who is extremely respectable in some respects, falls leisurely behind the tail of the red dragon, completely ignoring whether he will be after the war. Red Dragon is harsh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the soul of the outside world quite commensurately remembered a joke. This joke even made it blush, but the red dragon's flame did last for so long, it not only destroyed the clouds there, but also made stone bricks. The walls and towers of the building are also burning, and the lions and lions are swooping down. The fire is not as stable as the skylight, but for them and the knight, it is enough, and the casters can guarantee themselves without the need for light. The spells won't fall through - the Red Dragon sternly stated before the war, this war does not allow excessive consumption of its own power, that is, the way the Greinada people like to solve competitors needs to change. But it is like the warning of the alien soul from the lich. In Grenada, the invisible, inaudible, and unsearchable crimes are non-existent crimes. I want them to give up this convenience completely. The means is not an easy task, but the Red Dragon needs only slightly curb the momentum of being too crazy. It only cares about what the "mother" has given it. Those who sham to be careful, lest unable to escape falling within the minions of the Red Dragon<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at least today, knights and casters may not need to worry about threats from behind, the lions and lions swoop down, the warlocks make The last gesture, and the knights pull out the spears, they will run through every caster who has to show his body after the spell has fallen. The lions and lions are only a few feet away from the wall. Open the wings, ready to pass over from the top, leaving only flames, lightning, poisonous fog, and short spears like a scorpion<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They almost inevitably screamed with joy and joy, but their castration was suddenly terminated - they ran into a transparent Above the barrier, the changes in the original rain may also make these birds aware, but in the light and dark contrasts of too much disparity, their eyes can hardly perceive the small difference, although there are several eagle lions rushing into the body. Among them, but they found that they might be worse than those who slipped softly from the barrier, because almost every bird has more than two casters waiting for them, the warlock of Grenada. They were fixed on the saddle of the lion beast, originally to ensure that they would not be smashed down when the lion beast rolled over, but now it became a tool for them, the opposite, the lion When the beast is hit by the spell and falls behind, it can quickly stand up, revealing a fierce look and sharp claws to shake the enemy, but the two people on the saddle, the caster and the knight make it a little bit away - Although the knight and the caster can Extremely quickly untied the strap on the saddle, but then quickly takes time, and time is precious to snatch their enemies<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon saw the fire, but this fire is not what it wants to see, the fire extends from the wall under her to the distanceThese humans seem to have expected that they will attack in the middle of the night, and have already set a despicable trap, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but if it shrinks, it will not be a red dragon. It roars angrily and urges more eagle lions to attack the transparent barrier. This is also unexpected for the people of Longshan. If a road is found to be closed, shouldn't it choose another road? ? What they didn't think was that the red dragons were much more arrogant than they thought. Other walls may or may not be there, but here, humans will not set up a second invisible barrier, let alone the lions and beasts. When they perceive the barrier, they don’t stupidly hit them directly. They either stick out their claws or stick out sharp edges and smack the barriers. Their work is fruitful and may only be between a few breaths. With the cracking sound that almost disappeared in the rain, the barrier disappeared.The lion-headed lions roared down, and the eagle-headed lions who were trapped by humans began to fight back madly and violently, as well as the knights and warlocks of the Grenada, who could rely on the eagle The hard wings and strong body of the beast are shields. Although this inevitably causes the birds to scream and complain and curse, their fearlessness can cause enemies, especially those who are devastated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dragon screamed excitedly, its voice was loud and hoarse, and everyone who heard it trembled uncontrollably. It was above these humans. Hovering, the sac is inflated, and a new flame is brewing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong," Kelmen asked: "Don't we have to do something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I think that is very good," said the dragon thorn, a thief pointed to a place that was a square tower, close to the city wall, similar to another plane in the east of the city, with soldiers in and out , a few casters are guarding it, "The guy who is under the abyssKylemen suddenly said: "They have a big brake! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large brakes, it may be more dangerous to shoot Kremar and his companions than before, or they exist to kill Dead dragon, because every arrow is a secret silver arrow, and after enchantment, it is as tall as an adult male. To shoot such a long arrow, not only the dwarf craft, pure steel, but also magical help is needed. But they can not only threaten the dragon, but also kill the giants, or smash the orcs into a string, because the relationship is too high, even the Thunderbolt can not be equipped, or perhaps because of the Thunderbolt anyway Don't have to think about the reason why the dragon is attacking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
