Its greater role is to paralyze the other's consciousness. A "scratch" of Dada's squat recognizes the unique color of the poison taken from the giant viscera's internal organs, and knows how to remove it from humans. Adverse effects - just wipe the wound with wine and vinegar, and then drink a lot of water for the injured, in addition, the Norman king of the Highlands is not too scary and scary, the worst place It is the bruise left by the back of the rock. It only needs a priest's treatment. She is completely okay; the pirate who grabbed the nectar is shot by the arrow, and the priest's magic is made to the spirit. Consciously use force, And the two ribs of the priest were broken. In the next ten days, she had to give up the silk gown and entangled the rough and thick soil cloth (from the palm leaves) to avoid the rib spurs displaced by the inadvertent movement. Into the tender internal organs. WwW.XsHuoTXt.com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As seen by the Norman’s Master Gavin, the main target of the female warlock who is the means of the haze, the black hair The situation of peers can't really be said, especially after he used his body as a shield for the sacred elves several times in order to prevent Kerry from being injured again, although his looks and actions were not like one. The seriously injured person can show it, but it is an indisputable fact that the warlock fell silently as soon as he escaped, but he refused Gavin’s treatment on the grounds that he had a therapeutic potion, but instead His own treatments all poured into the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps he did have some unexpected potions. At noon the next day, Gavin saw the black-haired caster unscathed from him. The tent came out. His face is quiet and his face is dull - the lich has to thank the body for the damage it is more inclined to negative energy, cursing and acid, which is only a sinister disease for those positive energy that is raging inside the body. . If yesterday is not a weak bloody Reyote but his brothers and sisters, for example. Ostal, he is not sure if he can retreat, and even more, he will reveal his true identity prematurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should probably talk to his cohabitants, but now he has to keep his eyes for the elves, and the undead who once murdered the other 10,000 times A soul who lives in this body - he is about to become a pastor of Ilmot, but in the end he still confessed to the so-called "potion" - his blood diluted and blended, though He can't say that he has 100% confidence before using it. Who knows what it will be like? It is said that Kerry is using his blood for the second time. The first time the elf did not become an eight-claw octopus, it can be said that Angris bless, this time the lich wants Angris to still care about this pale blond hair. The elf, the only child of the king of the silver-crowned jungle, don't grow a few eyes because the positive energy in the potion is too fierce. Imagine that the elf Ranger Kerry has a compound eye like a fly, of course, that It’s ridiculous. The problem is that the Lich can determine whether he was forced to solve the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately. There was no superfluous or abrupt change. The two eyes of the elf were still as bright as stars, and the cursed scars on the cheeks began to dry. Smooth, no more irritating black blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took a break in the broken black rock. The Norman soldiers in the Highlands had twelve wounded, but there were no dead or serious injuries. The injured were still In a low voice complaining and ridiculing each other, rushing to inform Byrd Wen - about how much fish, lobster and pork the other party ate in Bitumindi, will grow a lot of fat in such a short period of time, Causes slow movements. They will be stabbed by a dwarf-like pirate with a toothpick-like sword and a dagger--Bedwin and they are lying in a tent, making a loud laugh from time to time. In fact. Even if these soldiers got enough rest and plenty of food in the days of staying at Bibi Dibao, they couldn’t get rid of the dryness and weight loss that had accumulated over the past few months. They are just like the Cavaliers. The brows are particularly prominent. The eye sockets and cheeks are sunken into three deep shadows. After taking off the coat and shirt, you can clearly see the outline of the ribs and shoulder blades. There is almost no muscle at all. I can imagine what kind of days they used to be worried and ill-fated, wandering around, nowhere to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jackets and shirts they took off were cleaned, but even if they were as clean as snow, they could not hide the new seams. Wen is also very familiar, long and narrow, streamlined is left by the sword, the shape of the star is left by the arrow, and those three or four columns, from the claws of the orc - the anger of the scorpion is like The tide usually beats the heart of the former Thunderbolt lord and the paladin. He doesn't know how Dylan Don Cray thinks. Does he think that Thunderbolt has become the cornerstone of the orcs that have never been shaken for centuries only because it is a solid Fortress? No, the Thunderbolt, which cannot be compromised, exists only because of his people, loyal knights, fearless soldiers, their families, craftsmen and businessmen who serve soldiers and knights. They are the strongest shields and most powerful. Sharp spear, and now, the son of old Don Cray, his brother, is splitting, destroying and smashing this solid fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin has heard about things related to Thunderbolt, and he knows that Dylan has been controlled by his mages with the support of the new king. The human beings are on the steel barrier of the orcs. The knights and the soldiers are screened one by one, deleted, removed, those who miss him, or who are not in favor of Dylan’s practices, are forcibly driven away, and their families are also Suddenly expelled from the ancestral homes, the rest of the craftsmen and businessmen also need to undergo a rigorous review, slightly inappropriate, Dylan's merchants will also find the corresponding personnel to replace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former lord of Thunderbolt once doubted whether his approach was correct. Before he left the king, he was glad that Thunderbolt could still have a Don Cray rule and despise, but he found that he was wrong, I don’t know when Since then, Dylan Donkre is no longer the green-eyed bunny in his memory. He is no longer the brother of Birdwin Don Clay. It is no longer the son of old Don Cray, he does not love them, on the contrary. He is full of hatred for them - New King John and Dylan's mother, Princess Ang Prin, have injected their venom into the child's heart for decades. To make him hypocritical and ruthless, in order to completely erase the traces of Birdwin, Dylan Donkley did not mind shaking the foundation of the entire Thunderbolt, his anger even spread to these innocent soldiers - in their thunderbolt For the Norwegian Norman, he paid nearly one-third or even one-half of his life. He discarded them as if they had thrown away a piece of rubbish, letting them endure hunger, cold and orc's minions in the endless wasteland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin’s body was hit by the sea monster’s flail, and there was a torn flesh in addition to the broken bones. His legs were also pierced by a dart, and there were more, large and small wounds, but the pain they brought was not as much as one in the heart of Birdwin, lying beside him and walking outside the tent. For the time being, at the border of the landlord of Luzer, the soldiers are full of sorrows. They are like brothers and children of Birdwin, and when Lord Baldwin is the lord of Thunder. All he can do is to keep them warm. Occasionally one or two silver coins can be used to bring surprises to his wife and children, but what harm does he bring to them? So deep. Unrecoverable damage, until today, Baldwin could not say sorry to them, nor can they make up for them - his wide sword, chain armor, coins and even clothing belong to the royal girl Leona, and they will The shelters that were obtained belonged to Kremar, and even the food, swords, and bows they received were provided by the Archbishop of Biyindi and the Master Alva, Bywin? He himself is empty-handed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repaired to Bywin, maybe someone else didn't find it. But he did follow Bodwin's nearly ten years in any case, although he was responsible for the logistics and preparation of the Knights before the sudden change. But his understanding of Baldwin is no less than his embarrassment. It is a pity that Baldwin’s relatives, those who followed him to the kingdom, were shackled and shackled by the new king with the charge of rebellion. Those who remained in Thunderbolt were also jailed by Dylan Don Clay on various charges. After that, there was no news. Exile was a blessing for them, but he could not say to Bedwin. Otherwise, his poor master is afraid that it will be difficult to escape from the abyss of repentance and sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are still alive," said the softly, "We are alive, and we are reunited together," he stared at Birdwin's eyes: We... have been waiting for you, Sir Alex."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "Waiting for you, take us back to Norman in the Highlands, return to the kingdom, and return to the Thunderbolt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dada is caught in a busy schedule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slaves who serve the host and his friends need to be brought back (although some soldiers are willing to do the work, they will not obey the orders of an outsider); There are more choices in the "hands", the soldiers may not need slaves to serve, but the knights are definitely needed, and almost all of them come to the men of the prime, where Dada’s father and brother have I know what these people need most; there is also "Shantou". Dada orders them to let the slaves offer more food. You can't let these people catch fish by themselves. Moreover, the soldiers here are almost all bad. Water-based scorpion (the nickname of Southerners to the North), if you can't get enough bread for a while, it is okay to add sucrose and beet sugar. This right is still within the reach of Dada; The tents and sedan chairs of the host and the guests have been burned by the flames, the horses have been scared away, or the legs and neck have been broken. These require Dada’s handwritten book and the master’s seal to re-enter the business. They mobilized, oh, the master has no seal, well, the magic runes are also possible, perhaps this can make the merchants move faster, the biggest problem is that these need Dada to personally negotiate with the merchants, "Taro "And the "bovine horse" one is the tool, the other is the livestock, the merchants will not even say a word to them; fortunately, the soldiers are willing to help, they climbed the palm trees, cut the leaves and set up the tent, and There were pirates who had no life. The soldiers originally wanted to bury the graves on the sand to bury them. Dada stopped them. For these evil thieves, the best place to bury is the sea, do not need to drive a boat, just remove their clothes, move to the place where the sea can submerge the whole body - Longhuo Island is rich in a kind of called They are the rotted creatures of giant starfish. Some people say that they are naturally generated. Others think that they are the products of warlocks. However, they do not harm corals like other starfish. The number is not so amazing, so the people of Longhuo Island also Just follow them - their favorite is the rotting corpse, fish, shellfish, shrimp... from the body of a small seaweed larvae to a whale body as large as a house, if there is no external interference Even the latter, it takes a night to be completely covered by the giant starfish. The giant starfish in groups will spit out their stomachs and secrete acid to dissolve the bodies, like the size of pirates. Three nights can be eaten clean,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business people are coming soon, bringing food, horses, tents and sedan chairs, and their fine Fine elected slaves - they had just arrived a few days in the dumb side of the island in Martha Crane et al., Pretending I do not know. On the island of the Dragon Fire Island, can a lord without an army be called a lord? Even if he is a caster, unless it is a dragon, how can he fight against an army? Even if he is not caught and killed, he will be forced to flee far away. In this case, it will be a struggle to please him. Not pleased. Even in the nightly banquet, more than one guy secretly made a bet, betting that their new lord could linger on the side island for a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
