			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that in the future of the bard's songs, this year's snow cover swamp is not his last chapter." Gülen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It may be difficult." The black-haired spellcaster said honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the outsider of another plane, the dragon is simply the most unimaginable thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its broken memory, there are also dragons, but those dragons will only appear kindly on paper and screen, and they are thin and long With mane and beard, huge double horns, when accompanied by clouds and rain. But now, just a few hundred feet away from him, is a black dragon, its wings spread even when it is covered, and its head is coldly overlooking its tiny prey in places as high as hundreds of feet. We, its long tail is submerged in the swamp, but even so, it still looks as long as the walls of Thunderbolt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is there a black dragon here?" the gnome McGee screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also want to know this question." Perant said, as far as he knows, the last black dragon died a thousand years ago, and it can act A few days after the departure of his companions - it has grown to the extreme, so it can not break through the plane's embarrassment, but this is not to say that it will be quiet, one person huddled in the cave to die, waiting for the caster to use Prophecy finds it, and its treasures, and then robs them. Like other colored dragons, when life is about to come to an end, it swallows all the treasures and uses the acid from the stomach. Melt them, then flap the wings, fly out of the cave, land in any country or city where it can reach, want to kill and destroy - to persecute and lure brave knights and wizards to kill it, destroying it After the happiness of countless people, even for it, death does not seem to be worthy of hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, there have been people who have said that there was a white dragon that destroyed a city in the same way, and someone found a collection of brass dragons. - Although he was very embarrassed by the spells left by the brass dragons, it was obviously worth it - but after that, except for the Red Dragon of Grenada, there was no other found on this plane. Traces of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we are indeed a black dragon in front of us." Gülen said. For a moment, he thought if he should try to ask after questioning - if there is - will he encounter an opponent like a demon master or a god, but he will soon take this thought from his mind. Deleted, no, the dragon is enough, this story can at least support a dozen bards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Dragon didn't give them too much time—although it used to hide all of them in the mud and white velvet and wanted to ambush the adventurers, but the pioneers driven by it inadvertently revealed its whereabouts, even In the intense battle, the Druid still found a clue. The abdomen of several swamp crocodiles were severely contused. The scales of the swamp crocodile are not much softer than the black iron. Only the steel can be contused, the Mithril and Fine gold, but the scars dragged out by the scales are completely different from the weapons. Perlant only measured with a finger to estimate how big the contused swamp crocodile belly is, and the approximate shape - Perant has participated With the war before the evil dragon, he saw the dragon's scale-like scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves and humans immediately chose to retreat, because Perant had fought with the colored dragons, and he knew how difficult it was to deal with this evil, Black Dragon Then, from the tumbling mud and fluffy flowers, the wings were raised, the huge body covered the sky, and the splashing black water even swallowed the entire pygmy McGee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should we do?" Leona asked: "Apart from running away?" Even if she has never seen a dragon, she knows that running away is fundamental at this moment. It's a down-and-down strategy - only a caster can cast spells to escape, but in the snow cover swamp, the transmission of spells is not allowed, but he may be able to become a small animal to escape, if lucky is not violent The storm set by the dragon was drowned. At this time, the black dragon has bent the head and neck, its wings are tightened backwards, and the **** is obviously sunken: "It has to squirt acid!" "Pelant shouted: "Everyone is moving closer to the Master!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the black-haired caster has ripped a reel, the magical energy in the reel whistling With him as the center to form a ring with bright light, the ring is human and elf, the pygmy McGee is under the legs of Birdwin, because he fears he vomits, but no one pays attention to this, the black dragon The acid has poured into their heads like a torrential rain. If it wasn't for Krimamar, who was reminded to take out the protective reel earlier, they might not even have bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Dragon’s acid spurt continues to last for 20 times, which may be the longest 20 breaths in their life – the black dragon fan moves the wings The head of the triangle is turned to observe the result of the acid - for the result it certainly does not feel, satisfied, the soul of the alien world perceives that a line of sight falls on him. So remarkable, let him chill from the back to the fingers, just like the line of sight will be solidified by the magic, and straight into his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Black Dragon is very smart, the Lich says, it has found you. It knows that to destroy a team, the first thing to do is to kill the caster among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Thank you for your reminder, the soul of the outside world said, but I would like to know if there is any way for us to get rid of it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The speed in the swamp and the black dragon is the worst joke. As for the spell, I think you can turn yourself into a otter, and then try to Dive into the water, but be aware that Black Dragon has a chance to charm the crawling creature every day. I hope that your will is strong enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——You know that this is impossible. The soul of the aliens replied, but the Lich's proposal gave him an inspiration. He took out a scroll and looked at Birdwin, the gnome McGee at his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mckey, come out." It said softly, but perhaps McGee had other ideas, he clung to the doubles of Birdwin Legs, no matter how unwilling to come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods bless," Gülen shouted. "Now it's not the show time. If he doesn't, Kremar, you can use that scroll. On my body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin sternly stunned the thief, but he also knew that Gülen said it was completely correct, and he did not feel black. The caster casts a terrible spell on McGee. He leans over McGee's shoulder and uses only two fingers to gently pinch it. The gnome has no strength, and Baldwin puts him up. "Don't ..." The gnome sobbed and pleaded: "Please don't abandon me... I am very useful, I swear... please..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute. Gülen said that he hadn't waited for McGee to cast a grateful look. He swept his hands and took the bow and the short sword from McGee. The gnome screamed and almost bit the thief's finger. head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the soul of the outside world has torn the reel, "Run!" he said briefly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the magical light disappeared, a gray water crawling out of the clothing and the secret silver chain ran around for half a lap, obviously The new vision and the extra legs made it dizzy. Fortunately, there was Gülen. He always played his role in the necessary moments. The thieves just jumped on the toes and cleverly smashed the otters out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he can actually put the gnome's Mithril chain into his own leather arm before the dragon spits the acid again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Let me take a closer look at it, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I try to be. The soul of the alien world said that this acid vomiting was almost in vain, as the last time. The only result was the destruction of the clothes left by the gnomes, but Gülen shouted, and a otter slammed out and took him. The legs were tightly wrapped together. He fell with the otter in the mud, splashing, and the dragon turned his head sharply. The line of sight was lingering around Gülling. It seemed to be considering whether it was first. Try a small snack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not very good!" Gülen said: "I swear I have expired for a long time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;An arrow with a magical light screams, only a few millimeters into the dragon's eyes, the magic makes it deeply into the dragon's scales and muscles, the black dragon roared violently One sound, turned to the other direction, and the elves have already put on the second arrow, but the black dragon did not neglect this time, it stretched out its claws, the arrow hit its claws, and the waves after the burst made the giant The dragon's claw tip also cracked, but it was not fatal, and it couldn't even be hesitated. It waved its wings and rushed to the elves, but at the same time the third arrow was at the same time as the spellcaster's spell. When it arrived, it was pushed to one side by several forces and fell into the mud. The rising black mud water was as spectacular as the inverted waterfall, but after it fell, the black dragon disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Is it gone? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——How is it possible? The Lich answers and raises vigilance. In addition, you may be happy to hear this news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——铠甲! The lich cried high, and his cohabitants did not hesitate to cast the corresponding spells. A huge, stinky mouth leaped from the ground where they stayed, the mud shattered and fell into the black dragon's throat, but It immediately found himself stuck, and a bright ball was perfectly embedded between each tooth that was two feet long. It bite and tried to swallow it. Nothing benefits from hurting his teeth. It ponders for a while, screaming back and forth, avoiding the arrows of the elves, Leona’s fine gold hammer and Birdwin’s Mithril wide sword in the air. I danced for a while. It almost succeeded, but at this time, it found that the magical energy in the ball was violently surging. It might be able to chew this nasty spellcaster between the teeth, but he could still cast it at the last moment. The spell, and it may be burned or melted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the acid, the caster was spit out, and when the spell failed, he threw the next spell. This spell, as Black Dragon expected, was a huge fireball. The acid and the fireball violently collided and exploded. There was a sour smell that made people feel the throat burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If you really find something, the soul of the outside world asks in a hurry, please let me know, if you don’t say it again, maybe we will use it. Never have to say anything, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This is a deformed dragon. The Lich said that it is not complete, and it is not a real dragon, but a dragon egg, which was accidentally discovered and cultivated in a special way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- But that is also a dragon, the soul of the opposite world said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——A dragon that is not mature enough, may never mature, the Lich says, look at its skull, the skull is distorted - the black dragon is already It’s ugly, because the deep eye sockets and the large, deep nostrils, as well as its horns and cheekbones, the skin of the distal ends of the wings will also degenerate and shatter as time goes by, seemingly broken, like a It only wraps the bone dragon with broken skin, so it is often called the dragon of ignorance by the ignorant human being. I can imagine how terrible it is. The lich has noticed this. Although this black dragon has adult dragons. Size, but its head is not so ugly, and the skin that should have been degraded is still in place, with no signs of cracking and drying - it may be ripened, like humans Grapes and peaches are grown in the greenhouse, and the casters do the same when they need to cast materials or test items in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it will be dispatched to accomplish this task. If it is said that its intelligence and body are not so good, it may not be possible to ask for too much compensation. There may not even be a gold coin if it is controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant once shot three sharp arrows, once again attracting the attention of the Black Dragon, the two elves are like waterfowl, walking lightly on the swamp Running, taking turns to drag it, but this behavior is undoubtedly very dangerous, Perant burned his arm with acid, and his hair, just ruined his face and eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan has now escaped from the enthusiasm of the otter with the help of the caster, his dagger pierced the mouth of the otter, and Separate it to the point where it softly falls to the sides, "弩 arrows." The black-haired caster said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
