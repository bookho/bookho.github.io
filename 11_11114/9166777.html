			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelmen chose soldiers instead of those mages, and he tended to use his own power to abuse those who could not protect himself and hurt him, instead of himself In an ominous situation - but he immediately found that the wall around him was shaking and twisting slightly. He suddenly spun like a dance. The rune on his body gave a warning light, telling the unknown enemy that he had Prepared for protection and counterattack spells, but he couldn't find anything. He turned his arms back and pulled out the two sharp swords that were inserted in the back waist, relying on the ability of the Dragon Warlocks to give them their natural ability. Rotating around the body, they will follow the movement when Kylemen moves<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Dragon’s son tentatively released a spell, hoping it would destroy the enemy’s trap, and he heard a slight, glass-like sound. The smoke and the screams rushed in, filled with all his senses. Kelmen waved his arm and let a breeze blow away the smoke. A panicked human soldier suddenly appeared in front of him. He showed an evil. Smile, gently hold a hand, only a large fireball like a walnut is produced in the palm of his hand, and then jumped into the air as if given life, straight into the nose of the soldier, the soldier jerked up The hand grabbed his face, his eyes were full of horror, and the innocent man opened his mouth, as if to spit out the fireball - then, his nose and mouth had black smoke, then 迸Shooting the flame, he burned from inside to outside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier stood stiffly, like a human-shaped torch, a long call from another place, but unfortunately he could not answer, more It is impossible to hear or see. His eardrums and eyeballs are the first to rupture. Like a few urinary sputum filled with water, Kelmen heard the rushing and scattered footsteps. Obviously there are more people from The end of the smoke ran over, he listened to his ears and analyzed the footsteps of everyone. On the battlefield, the casters, especially the wizards, wore tights, pants and boots like mortals, but those who worked fine. The boots and the boots of the soldiers, or the boots of the wooden boots are definitely different. Those who rushed over did not have a caster. Kelmen paused for a while and his face suddenly became blurred. Up, then his red robe and chain arm. When those humans came to him through the smoke, they saw a human soldier instead of a red robe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jojo! What happened?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A monster," Kay Ermen finely made himself look like he was hurt a little. The blood ran down from his forehead and further disguised this false face. "It disappeared after it spit fire.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soldier, perhaps their captain, because he was wearing a very beautiful and new leather armor and said, "How do you feel?" Need a potion, or a pastor? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I want to catch it, I broke my head on the stone brick, but only one point," Kelmen tried to make unique to young people. Pride of pride: "Just a little gray, I am fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that? The captain noticed the "thing" that was about to go out: "I remember there is no such thing as a stake.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is a person"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? ! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably your Joe JoeKelmen said, and then he cast a spell that was already prepared. When these humans were close in concern, the lightning jumped and squeaked one by one on them. The human soldiers failed to make a point before falling. The voice, but the captain, perhaps because the leather armor for him resisted some damage. Although his legs were paralyzed by the burning of lightning, he lost the chance to escape, but he still struggled to The tiny flute was put in the mouth, and a sharp voice suddenly rang through the entire wall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the dragon thorn heard a sharp flute, it should be Kelmen He strangely thinks that the three-person black-haired dragon is not the one that makes him feel troubled. He pursues the source of the flute and runs, and more people seem to be doing the same thing. He is The crowd is like a hyena mixed with a flock. Through the smog and darkness, he gently grabs a young white robe from behind, like a hug. The latter obviously lacks experience in the battle. In the face of the attack, he did not launch the runes, scrolls, potions, anything else that could work immediately, but was busy humming and gestures, but the thief’s cold fingers reached his mouth, fingers The folder smashed his tongue, and then his dagger was stabbed in from the priest's eyes, and the priest only made one or two. It didn't move, the thief heard someone groping for approach, maybe the priest's companion found that there was one less person around him, so he came back to look for it - he took out the dagger, wiped it clean on the priest's cheek, pulled out the folding bow, and slammed the bow. Even a quiet night in a quiet place may not be able to wake a vigilant cat, but he hears the caster's soft sole moving to another place, and the venomous arrow is empty.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————————————————————————————————— ——<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat warlock is one of the few warlocks in the country of Longshan. You know, the warlock is very special except for Grenada. Discriminated against - the attitude of the people of Longshan State to the warlock can not be said to be too bad, although they are also very curious, but their rulers will at least not blame all the crimes on a warlock, and they still hope A dragon sorcerer can appear in the children of Longshan State - because they are descendants of Yinlong, the silver dragon is obviously more noble and kind than the red dragon of Grenada.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the fat warlock settled in a small state full of grapes, he certainly has his own lingua franca name, but because of the "fat" The pronunciation of the word is quite close, and his body is far superior to the relationship of ordinary people in terms of height, width and depth. He does not know when he started, he is called a fat warlock.Maybe some warlocks will be furious, but the fat warlocks think that there is nothing wrong with this, so if anyone wants to curse oneself, don't say your real name, you don't know the name of the connected language! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the people here don’t think like the people in other places, thinking that he’s just stuffed with a baby’s belly at any time. Bats and cockroaches, sorry, I am not the kind of warlock. The fat warlocks often yelled in their hearts angrily before, letting you down, my stomach has nothing but wine, sugar and barbecue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the fat warlock occasionally wonders why he is standing here, he may be better than many casters, but he never wants to face a grid Rena's red robe warlock, he knows that those people are crazy, their red robe is not the same as their own red robe, their red robe is not compromised with human blood, the fat warlock's red robe The color comes from wine. He also thought that if there was a war, he said that there was a war between Grenada and the country of Longshan. To hurt and die, but compared with Grenada, the trauma they cause is not worth mentioning at all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And since the red dragon of Grenada has already appeared here, it shows that the state of Longshan will inevitably be completely erased, the only difference is only time Length<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should have escaped, before the army of Grenada approached here, there were mages and warlocks to escape, really, and the council and people of the Longshan state It doesn't seem to stop them. He can go. He has sorted out his pockets, skin bags, and... maybe something like a carriage. He doesn't have a wife or children anyway, except for wine merchants and butchers. He almost had nothing to do with it. The fat warlock sorted out day after day. He had walked to the front of the city several times, but he always felt that he had forgotten something and went back to find it. Upside down, when the Archon's guard came to his door and asked if he would like to join the ranks of the casters who resisted the Grenada Army, the fat warlock just sighed and picked up his reel belt. Potion pack, dimension bag, skin pouch, this time he has not forgotten anything<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and the two mages were dispatched to guard the square tower. In fact, they did not protect the soldiers but the large brakes hidden in the square tower. This kind of smashing arrow can destroy the dragon's scales and deeply embed its flesh. The enchanted arrow will burst in the relatively fragile body of the dragon. If you are lucky, this burst will directly tear the dragon. The heart, this is the only way to kill a dragon other than powerful magic and similar minions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Red Dragon strikes, the fat warlock is fighting, of course, you can also say that it is meditation, the fluctuation of magic before the sound and light alarmed him. He jumped up with his fat belly, like a cat that was too focused on enjoyment. Although fat is like a ball, it still has the agility and vigilance that even the viper is hard to match. - No waiting for the order, the brakes in the square tower were prepared for the red dragon from the beginning. He opened the door and the soldiers pushed the brakes onto the wall from the horse road (a ramp that allowed the horses to go up and down the city wall). The car that can launch such a giant arrow requires four people to push and pull at the same time, or in the case of the dwarf's exquisite design, creation and rune assistance - the frame of the brake car was specially made into olive black color. Consistent with stone bricks, the metal part is blackened and some key parts are covered by grey linen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also saw the dark shadows of the fast, in the shadow of the fire, they are as sharp as the nails that pierce the eyes<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the eagle lion body swooped down, the fat warlock threw a spell that protects against energy damage without any consideration. This spell can only be shrouded. Some people and some of the cars, but he also heard the singers of the wizards, which made the fat warlocks feel a little calm, the flames are swelled around them, he has never experienced such an attack - those flames are like It can be touched, it can be taken, and it can be violently impacted on his protective barrier. He can hardly breathe and can't open his eyes. The stone bricks under his feet become hot, and the fat warlock feels like he is being The iron fork was inserted into the duck in the oven. There was a fire everywhere. His grease screamed out from under the skin. Every breath of air inhaled in the body made him feel like he was swallowing a burning piece. charcoal<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
