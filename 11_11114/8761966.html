			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon's face gloomy out of the Master's Tower of Antonio, and the shadow cast by the white tower is like an invisible giant sword, shrouded in his around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t cover his own bad mood, one of the congressmen, the president of the Cloth guild who had paid bribes to him, wanted and now The White Tower Architect will say a few more sweet words, and he will be pleased to please him. He will try to invite him to his home. The governor is already twenty-four years old, and his father will still have a future. Give him a marriage contract, and when he is still a mage, although not so accidentally, you often see him in the temple of Fro or some of the more famous baboons, but he never appears in a certain In the woman's arms, that is to say, he has not yet had a soft spot for the woman. The president of the cloth guild has exactly three daughters. He knows that his wife is the daughter of a farmer, if not muddy and malnourished. Can't hide the beauty, how can she become his wife? Fortunately, his three daughters followed their mother in both appearance and body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are 19, 15, and 11 years old, ranging from blooming flowers to young buds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You love to pick anyone!" The president shouted in his heart, if one of them could become the wife of the consul, yes, that is the perfect If not, then as a fixed mistress, the right to have children, so how much he will save. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I’m afraid it’s not going to happen today. He regrets that it’s the basics of business people, and he’s vaguely guessing why their new governor is doing this. He was in a bad mood, but he was not prepared to lie for him. After all, Antonio Master invited other people - his companion is a rare conscientious guy, and this is too much involved, a small businessman If he was accidentally dragged in and smashed, he just breathed and carefully bowed to the lord and the consul, respected the truth again, and walked quietly against the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon’s attendant brought him his horse, a dark horse that once belonged to his brother, very tall, one step can take about fifteen feet. It was a little uneasy when it was pulled closer to Demon. He kept snoring and honing his hooves. The caster didn't even think about it. He grabbed the whip from the waiter's hand and smacked his back. The horse made a long sigh. , sharp and fearful, it began to violently up, erect, desperately kicking the waiter who pulled the reins, Demon walked away, coldly watching the idiot who had blocked the horse for a few whipes and tried to comfort it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the horse gradually became calm, Demon raised his hand and made a gesture. A short spear made of spells was thrown straight at the head of the black horse. It was penetrated and it fell to one side. Next, press the waiter under the heavy body, its wounds flowed out of black blood, and began to rot and stink in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just the first one, Demon thought, but when he turned around, he had a little regret - the Lord’s carriage was not like him. I thought that I left early, it was bathed in the beautiful sunshine, like waiting for something, and Anzhen’s personal maid was coming here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should tell her that this horse is mad," Demon said without hesitation: "Like our people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to his surprise, the aunt’s maid is not concerned with the horse. She was sent by Anzhen to ask if she needs to go back to the inner city with her, since his horse When something went wrong, Demon immediately smiled and accepted the invitation happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he boarded the carriage, An Zhen was playing with a careless attitude on the chest, the amber amulet that Demon gave her. Demon recognized it at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please sit down, cousin," An Zhen slightly sideways, using her eyes to indicate her opposite position: "I want to talk to you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also have this intention," Demon said, then closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day of the formal trial suddenly rained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hate rain." Kreima told Kerry Ben. "It always brings bad things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry knows why Kreima would say that he and Kremar are here. The hills encountered stormy and crazy bloodthirsty rabbits; the second time it rained, Fenway summoned a fire of negative energy that almost burned the entire gray ridge, and Ilva was cut off by the giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you always have a way to solve them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With fire," Crema Seoul said: "I am really worried that you will think that I am a arson."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has a slightly smile: "No matter what kind of strength has both good and bad, we have to see if it is controlled and whether it is led in the right direction." He put down his book and got up to open the window. "For example, if today Yadel and other innocent victims are still sentenced to death, I will allow you to set fire again to save them from the executioner's sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I will put on a fire that will make everyone remember." Kreima said half-truth, went to the window and waited with Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people on the street, both men, women and children, are wearing black mourning clothes. At the invitation of the bell, they rushed to the market square of Baita to participate and Watching this unprecedented trial, forming a dark and wide river - prisoners holding prisoners pass by them, but no one spits at them, pulls their hair, pokes them with sharp things, or throws them The rancid rubbish and the stone - the situation seems to be pretty good, and the representatives should have relayed the message they got to everyone in the White Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their attitudes are still prudent and alienated, but at least they are no longer so tight and full of hatred. A very small girl thought she was not so noticeably close to the van, stuffing a piece of bread that had been pinched for a long time, and then having an old mother quietly handing her son a wet headscarf to her son. So that he can drink some water, a wife also took a headscarf and slowly approached the car, giving her husband a piece of candy through a tough kiss; and the people around them only saw nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosada’s pastors have not added more scars, although they still can only stand tired and painful in a narrow cage, but still There is sober consciousness, even the most aging and weak chief pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We should also set off." Kerry Ben said, picking up the black cloak that Antonio Master had prepared for them, when they walked down the stairs, and the people stood. When they were together, this black cloak really eased a lot of sharp eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market square that can accommodate hundreds of booths is already full of people, and a platform about three feet high is built in the center. A long table covered with red velvet and more than a dozen chairs, two high-back chairs with slightly different heights still belong to the lord and the consul, one of the priests of the newly arrived Rosada, and another ten The two members of the White Tower, under the platform, have about 50 ordinary sitting stools, which are like the wings of a bird. They are offered to guests, witnesses and some wealthy businessmen or people. They are innocent, honest and honest civilians. They are both recorders and witnesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They first tried those who did not suffer from madness, but took the opportunity to rob and steal in the horrible catastrophe, although some of them argued that they had drunk the water that would cause madness, but in the caster and Luo With the cooperation of the priests of Sada, the lies were quickly debunked. The souls of the outside world were surprised to find that the way the White Tower was tried was somewhat democratic, because they were guilty. It is determined by the black and red colored wooden beads in a box. After the squad has read their charges, every free, adult male and female in Baita walks up one by one, to the one with only one opening. The box is put in the hand, only the pea-sized wooden beads, waiting for everyone to cast his/her beads, the box is opened in public, the executioner will loudly count, if the red beads are more than the black beads, then That person is not guilty, and vice versa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their odious thieves and robbers will certainly not be acquitted. The beads are almost all black, but the executioner still finishes them, then the lord Stand up and punish according to their crimes. If you kill someone, you will hang it. If you don't kill, you just steal the property. It is to cut your hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that they have tried to speed up, but when it’s Rosada’s pastor and those who have madness, they hang in Cremari The magical pendant on the chest still passed through the entire three grids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of Rosada stood up before he began to throw the beads. He took out a piece of parchment and read the name above, whether it was dead or not. They are still alive. They are all expelled by their gods and sects. They are not allowed to continue wearing the clothes of Pastor Rosada, licking his name, worshiping his icon, wearing his holy flowers, and not being It is allowed to enter any of the sanctuaries of Rosada, even if it is a sanctuary, and it is not allowed to borrow forgiveness or grace in his name. After this is done, it is the turn of the people to continue their trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beads that were dumped in this open box were red and black, and the number of eyes looked almost the same. The execution officer counted the number of cautious places, and finally the red beads only Two more than the black beads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the end result came out, the sinners shouted happily and tried to lift their rafts as if they were to break them and regain their freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon gently rubbed his palm, not knowing if it was raining or nervous, his hand was wet - but the rain did not hit him On the body, when the platform was built, it began to rain, and the skillful craftsmen immediately added a light oil tarpaulin - so nervous? Of course he was nervous. He even secretly cursed the mentor who had been away from the place, and the little devil who deliberately gave him the wrong message. If there was a chance, he would pinch the little devil's wings and stuff it into the mentor's. In the mouth and kicking them together, the endless abyss... It’s fortunate that the sergeant Fro, who was summoned, never saw his true face in this conspiracy and learned his identity, she I only know that it is a male caster. The things dug out of her mouth have no meaning and effect except for the ridiculous pastor of Rosada, who has the opportunity to get rid of the crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
