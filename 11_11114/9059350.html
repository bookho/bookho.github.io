According to the law of Longhuo Island, the son of the lord or the heir is not allowed to have a mage. · 1kanshu·cc<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't own Gavin," the Lich said quietly: "Gaiwen is Birdwin."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Gavin pretended to angrily retorted, "I think I have never signed any contract to sell myself!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I know, the lord's son will still be handed over with one or two masters in private," Cobbert said. "Someone has recruited Alva's disciples, and the reward is very rich." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are also wild wizards," said Kerry Ben, who has no deep friendship with the rulers of the Dragon Fire Island, but he also lived in the port. Some mage, like the “user” merchants, have luxurious and comfortable residences and hundreds of slaves, but they are not as demanding as the masters of the four island lords to listen to the master’s orders – the lords’ sons are not dare Blatantly and compulsory to bind them, although they may pay more than their father’s, but everyone All know that secrets are also a kind of goods at many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These mages stay in the port, on the surface they serve a merchant, use coral to make a small house or something, but if their real master needs it, They will still look at the discretion of the gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, we may have to face more wizards and warlocks later?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Basically, no," Cobbert said: "The battle between the son of the lord and the son of the lord cannot be caster, they can be summoned in advance. A devil, or a large swamp, but they can't appear in the army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it can appear in pirates." Revised, he screwed The silver wine glass is used to drink the olive wine. This olive wine is a special product of the Dragon Fire Island. It is fermented from the mixture of coconut water and water. It has a sour taste and low price with fresh broken olives. It is very popular with the Normans in the Highlands. They insist that this wine is good for relieving the discomfort of the stomach and skin. When Pastor Froer gave him a drink, he was politely thankful – in the first few days, he thought that this sergeant Froe, who had jewel-colored eyes, was imprisoned by the black caster. It’s not the case at all. The pastor’s identity among them is more similar to a... companion. Although her presence is indeed weaker than others, she is indeed the one of these people. The only caster outside of the battle, after this battle. To read a book, 1 book kanshu·cc, she also got a pocket, and she also got a part of the important strategic materials such as scrolls and wands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mi put down the heavy jug, rolled the curls lazily, and then reached for a huge silver plate and grabbed a piece of creamy lobster in his mouth. The sea breeze in the day passed through the half-open tent, bringing people Cool and cool--in the battle with the pirates a few days ago, she can say that she has the greatest courage, perhaps some brains, and she not only feels scared afterwards. I wonder how I did it. I know, even if a person told her that she would fight a group of pirates a year ago, she either thought that the person was talking nonsense, or that what he called "confrontation" was not The kind of "confrontation" that people usually think of is more shameless and free-spirited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results are still very good, she finally got a page in the black caster's book, although this thin page compared to other people It looks a bit pitiful. But Mei Misheng is self-aware, well, remove the incredible whimsy about Baldwin, but even when she loves Bedwin. She didn't even think about giving up her life and the identity of Pastor Fro - she has little pity, she doesn't have a strong body and subtle martial arts like Birdwin, and she doesn't like Leo. Na has a distinguished identity derived from the ancient blood, although Mei Mi suspects that her lineage is mixed with the orc's blood, removing the hammer that has been attached to the magic and makes the weight and texture completely incompatible, Leona The fine gold wide sword that I have used is no better than the temperature of Bedwin. Moreover, she can also open the longbows used by the Thunderbolt soldiers. It is said that these longbows were originally used to deal with the orcs; she is even worse than Gülen. She heard this thief when she was in the port of Tsim Sha Tsui. The name of the guild, if he did not meet Krimaar, and did not become an enemy with other guild members, Drake and the owner of the blunt pub because of this black caster, he might become the guild of the guild after ten years As for Kerry Ben, Mei Mi did not even think about comparing with him. If you say the truth, this kind of man, whether he is an elf or not, any man or woman standing by him can’t help himself. Half of the black caster and the guide - don't doubt Mei Mi's eyes and observation, although the owner of the side island is Kremar, but she knows who is the final. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she is satisfied with her current status. I want to know that Meimi’s biggest concern in the past is that they will find a temple of Fro in the Longhuo Islands. She stuffed it in, letting her fend for herself, and now she can sit in a tent with them, listen to them talking about and discuss some important things, even if the resolution does not have their own, but she has honey, delicious Food, silk, fine linen and cotton clothing in sandalwood boxes, gold necklaces inlaid with pearls and tourmalines, etc. - those merchants may have misunderstood her identity like the knight, after all, in a team, Fro's pastors are often owned by the most noble, or the most powerful, so they prepared a rich gift for her, according to the level of the lord, Ji Lun - more than Bird Wind and Gülen. Rich, they are so sincere and scared that Mei Mei laughs when they think about it. They probably don't know that she is sharing a tent with the seemingly humble thief. ·1kanshu·cc<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the bat is willing to drill, there will be a gap in the sky." Cobbbert said a very popular saying in the crew - people generally think of bats as long-winged mice: "But if the wizards can't be on the battlefield On the rise, we still have a bit of advantage - they can't always tie Kremar's fingers together, that is, Gavin has to work hard, now we can't be caught by others - I think you can still find out "One or two places."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have no problem." Gavin said that if the wizard needs to get to somewhere, there is still a way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One or two?" Birdwin smiled and asked: "To confuse the enemy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No," he looked at Yadel, a white clothed man who was squatting in a plate of oyster meat fried eggs with his feet. He hesitated: "I don't know the laws of Longhuo Islands." The details are just... except for the lord, other people are not allowed to hire a mage... or a caster? A warlock. And a pastor?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course not," Kerry has paused. He will look down on Mei Mi, thinking that she is talking about her: "There is no Fro Temple on the side of the island. But we can try to build a place, Mei Mi can preside over The sacrifice there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei’s eyes are bright, which is really good for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shovel shook his head slightly: "Not this...Ms.," he said eagerly: "It’s Yadel."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone outside of him showed a surprised expression, only Cobbert felt a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bradwin’s mind roared. Yadel was like him - he was expelled by his own god, but... he turned his head stiffly and slowly, and Yadell returned to the regular and boring life after he reached the side island. He is no longer with the soldiers of the Thunderbolt. Every day, he is not busy collecting herbs or knitting or polishing tools. Sometimes he goes fishing and catches crabs. He is like a normal herbist, fisherman and manual. The artist, Birdwin, wondered if he was the one who took more than 4,000 people out of the wilderness and passed them through three-quarters of the big six to bring them to the land of hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before seeing Yadel on the side of the island for the first time and sincerely thanking him, Baldwin barely saw it again (maybe no Note) to the followers of this former Rosada. He didn't notice the changes in Yadel, who looked as slick as the Normans in the Highlands, and looked pale. Now he looks at Yadel and concentrates on fear, hunger, and fatigue. Next, Yadel looks almost ten years older than his real age. His cheeks are a little bloody when he comes to the side island. His head is still silver, he can't see a little black, but the two on his face. Branded. A "sacred god", although a "sister" is still vivid, but not so profound, the muscles and skin that are pulled up by the scar left by the soldering iron become smooth. Let the whole face be no longer so twisted and twisted, and the two imprints that have sinned to the people all the time now seem to be drawn up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He..." Bydwin didn't feel so hoarse and sharp until he heard his voice. He hurriedly coughed and made it calm: "Yadale, has it been forgiven for Rosada?" "No," said Yadell. "I still are not allowed to shout his holy name." He looked at Baldwin with understanding, this and him. The former Paladin, who is in the midst of redemption and exile: "But, I think," he didn't want people to know that the shackles that were banned were loosening, lest his gods think he became proud and negligent, but he couldn't help but think I want to give this respectable person more support and encouragement: "I can... feel his warmth, although only for a short moment, I can feel... I am being watched..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One year, or two years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yadel has committed such a big crime, not one, but two, he turned his back on his god, even if this is not his intention, Killed his brother, driven by drugs, but who cares, his biological brother does not care, his face is branded with sinners, and his teacher and his compatriots are exiled, no one Willing to accommodate this person who is addicted to evil, especially when seeing the broken emblem of Rosada - when Baldwin was the lord of Thunder, he accepted him so generously and pitifully. But in the heart of Byrdwin, what Yadell can do is only this. He may be crushed by the orcs in the double wall of Thunder Castle just like a normal soldier in a few years, before he died. It is impossible to redeem such a heavy crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what did he see now? The brand of desalination, this is not something that medicine can do. It can only be said that the god that Yadel followed, Rosada of the morning light has put his eyes on him again, his sin is being eliminated, Was washed, and how long is he being tried and punished? Short is like a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Byrdwin, he may have committed the crime of the monarch, but it is not from his heart, but a product of a great conspiracy. He may be able to say that he is innocent! To this day, he even began to wonder if his sword had penetrated the pharaoh's throat at that time. Dylan was a mage, and the mage could do anything. He could completely remove Birdwin's sword from the master's control. Or let Pharaoh himself fall to the sword of Birdwin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was almost full of impulses for a moment, wanted to leave the tent, shouting in the name of Tyre in the hustle and bustle of the sun, how long he had not called him The name of the most loyal and loving god? Time should be short, but Birdwin thinks that is his entire life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
