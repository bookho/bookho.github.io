After being baptized three days later, the girl inherited the name of the old Cosimo wife and was named Constella. The boy was named Julio, Giulio di Giuliano de Medici. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History is full of lies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julio di Giuliano de Medici in the history book, like Constella, is Lorenzo de Medici Adoption, spend your carefree childhood and teenage years in the comfortable and safe Wichio Palace until. But in fact, when he was still awkward, he was handed over by his uncle to Bishop Francis Todescheni Pikromini, who was preached by Pope Siscott IV in central Italy. I spent the first six years of my precious life in a continuous trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, they came to Assisi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assisi, a small town situated between the hills, it even existed more than the city of Rome, as early as 238 years after the Lord, there was Saint Lufi He preached and taught, but eventually made it the holy city of Umbria and even the Balkans. It was founded in 1182 and in San Francisco in 1194. The former was founded. The Franciscan sects, who were poor in poverty, chastity, and obedience, were sacred in the two years after the death (1228), the latter being his loyal followers, founded the St. Galle Women's Retreat, 1253 He died in the same year, and he also sealed the holy two years later (1255). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the arrival of Assisi, this devout believer who has been living in poverty, chastity, and true sages has always been in constant stream. In the same year, in the monk Elia Under the initiative, the people and churches of Assisi funded the construction of the Franciscan churches and affiliated monasteries in order to accommodate more monks and pilgrims. The church was built close to what was originally called "Hell's Hill" and was built by the hills of Sanctuary, which was renamed "The Mountain of Heaven". It was divided into two halls, completed in 1253, extremely delicate and huge. And beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julio’s current guardian, a student of Bishop Bicroimini recently became the bishop of Perugia by relying on his uncle’s gold coin, he knows Bishop Piccolomini was preached by the predecessor of the Pope in the Umbria region, so he tried to invite his brother to come to Hajj and Franciscans. Of course, Piccolomini arrived in Weng. The Brass area was the first time to go through this sacrament, but the Hajj sage is just like doing homework, it will never be more or less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bishop of Piccoloni entered the Assisi, the morning class in the early hours of the morning had just ended, and the bishop of Perugia who got the news waited at the Franciscan Monastery. In front of the door, I happily placed my hands in front of the protruding lower abdomen. He specially selected a velvet robe called Dalmatika for today's reunion. The fuchsia velvet used in the robe came from Milan. Under the candle or the torch, there will be a little golden light, and the golden cross and a square badge will be hung on the chest. The Franciscan and the bird are engraved on the badge, and the deep purple crystal is inlaid. Behind him is the dean of the Franciscan Monastery, the priests and deacons, and the monks of St. Francis, wearing brown robes with hoods and white linen ropes around the waist, such as St. Francis So bare feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most trusted priests of the Perugia bishop holds him a golden sacred box containing a decaying rope, which is said to have been counted Ten years of entanglement in the waist of the saint, witnessed his faith and purity. Bishop Perugia is not very satisfied with this. He hopes to come up with something more worthy of people’s surprise, but St. Francis is not an ordinary saint. He carried out the retreat before and after the glorious cross. Forty days of fasting and retreat, for this reason angels came down from the clouds, giving him five hands and feet, five sacrificial marks under the ribs - and so far, the only holy mark recognized by the Holy See, and before his lifetime After death, there are still hundreds of miracles. His conduct and piety are unacceptable and skeptical. It is precisely because of this that no one dares to treat the other saints, from the Franciscans. The lower part of the body is cut and placed separately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Franciscans did indeed work as eloquently as he preached, and he did not even hold a wooden pole in his hands, so that he was fully equipped. After being detained by our dear Lord, the things he left were filled with dissatisfaction with a room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the people they waited for finally appeared on the gray-white path on a horse, the happiest thing was not the bishop of Perugia, but the waiter holding the curved pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyromini has jumped from the moment, for a man who is forty-five years old, he still looks very strong and agile, he shaves The hair was neatly arranged above the thick eyebrows, the eyelids were slightly swollen, and the eyes were as sharp as the eagle. His nose bent down and his mouth sagged down, making him daunting - he wore a piece and a holy The close-knit robes of the monks of Chiang, wrapped in a wide and long wool cloak, are pale yellow, without any bleaching, and without embroidery and buttons, only use a copper pin on the left shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deacon was waved and refused when he wanted to help him. Bishop Perugia made a dirty gesture in his heart, even with a Grimace, in view of his old classmates still not that incompetent, but did not have time to salute, did not have time to talk, Piccolooni gave him a big shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that Pikromini’s feet are on the ground is to lift the cloak and let the little guy who is hiding inside fell out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a child, about five years old, at most six years old, with a black curly hair, cheeks are as rosy as roses, his eyes are one Very very light brown, a thin amber is the color in the sun, the light of the torch and candle flashes in those eyes, like a star, like a dragonfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The son of a friend," said the bishop of Piccolo and Perugia, walking hand in hand on the promenade of the monastery: "Because For some reason, he can't stay with his loved ones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Perugia nodded and understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abbot is willing to give up his room, but neither Piccolomini nor Perugia has refused, and some of the monasteries are coming The room where the pilgrims lived with the lifelong monks, there was only one chair in the room, the bed, the monks had a small table in the room, they sat down at the small table, and the bishop of Perugia occupied the narrow bed. Piccolo used the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A monk came up with two not too extravagant nightingales, a few slices of sweet ginger used for appetizing, cabbage soup, creamy roasted lard skin, and finally used Chen The end of the year's cheese, in addition to the time, this meal is not too picky during the Lent: "The brothers who come from afar," Bishop Perugia pinches a piece of sweet ginger in the mouth Inside, I asked, "Are they all arranged properly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything is in order," said the deacon. "We have prepared a bathtub for them. Bread, salt and water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bathtub?" said Picromini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Bishop Perugia chewed sweet ginger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I remember correctly," Piccolomini said, "St. Francis has made it clear that 'dirty' also has God. One of the sexual markers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monk looked at the pilgrim with uneasiness, and Piccolo was only concentrating on immersing a piece of bread into the cabbage Soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "St. Francis has said that our sisters of water are so respectful, clean, and precious." Bishop Perugia said carelessly: " Our sisters who use water cleanse their bodies and follow his teachings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and glanced at the monks who were preparing to stand in the corner of the room. "Yes, boy," said the bishop. "You can go back to your room. We will chanting each other for each other, just as we were in Rome."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young monk immediately stood still. He was not the kind of devout person who for the purpose of concealment and did not enter for the rest of his life. The opportunity to serve the two bishops at the same time was equally rare. But he knew that there might be something that could not be heard by a normal monk like him, so he immediately quits the room docilely, leaving only Piccolo and the bishop of Perugia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you may be able to tell me." Bishop Perugia said, "Who is that child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a secret, isn't it?" said Bishop Perugia, as if he had never heard anything from his classmates: "We can trade, you tell me, I tell you, it may not be significant, but I guarantee that you will not owe my debts or be my creditors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to know?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The child you brought..." Bishop Perugia said: "Is it a hostage? Or a gift? Or is it another illegitimate child? The Romans have said that you already have twelve illegitimate children. It is as much as the disciples of Jesus Christ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Receive the sly words, you know that I have no illegitimate children, no mistresses." Cromini said that although he is not the kind of person who will treat himself as harsh as a monk, he is not good at chasing the heels of children and beggars like Roman priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s fine to let people talk like this," said Bishop Perugia. "Which deep red (the cardinal is dressed in color) or white (the color of the pope) There are no one or two children hidden under the long coat. The true holy people are on parchment and marble. Don’t let them think that you will be a threat.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Threats?" Piccomini looked up: "I am not even a cardinal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will be." Bishop Perugia Say, "You are a Piccolo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Picromini, whose key moment is thousands of miles away."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you are not ignorant of Rome." Bishop Perugia said that he crossed his hands with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our Father is in jeopardy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can last for a few months." Bishop Perugia said: "Possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The atmosphere in Rome has become tense?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some cardinals are collecting gold, what do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyromini has revealed a sardonic smile: "In fact, I I think they can use the method of craps to elect the pope," he said with less respect. "Whoever made the pope will reward each cardinal." He spread his hand: "It is fair and reasonable." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have prepared a lot of money," Perugia said. "Maybe you can change the color of your clothes."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can be a bit difficult," Piccomini said. "Is there anyone who will voluntarily give up teaching?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There may be someone who suddenly sends out Mad," Bishop Perugia said with sincerity: "But Piccolo, I want to go back to Rome, I don't want to be in this position to be drooping, nothing can happen."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your thoughts are worthy of respect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what about you?" Bishop Perugia asked: "You, you Piccolo, listen to this famous surname, you are the nephew of Pius II, the 22nd is the bishop, and Pius II allows you to inherit the name and family emblem of the Picromini family, you used to He has served in no less than three most important positions. In addition to your uncle, you have also taken care of Paul II's daily diet. He trusts you so much, loves you, regards you as his right arm, if not Francis. Sko de la Lovere..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Undoubtedly," Piccolo said calmly: "He knows how to bribe better than I do." And temptation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because you are always hesitant," said Perugia, dissatisfied "You could have made a career, not being so easily driven out of Rome by Lovere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, okay, Piccomini said: "I know what you think. If so, you can talk about what I need to do for you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not so utilitarian," Bishop Perugia said bluntly: "But yes, yes, I really need your help." . He stood up and opened the door and looked out: "Let the Father of Valencia come here." He said to the monks waiting outside the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
