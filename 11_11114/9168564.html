			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to kill JohnPrincess Yan An said that she wore all black robes, except for the bodyguard runes. She had no jewelry on her body and no rouge and lead powder on her face. Her aging face was completely revealed, but her bright eyes made it She looks like a flower with a fading color but deeper and thicker texture. People in Wangdu have a lot of arguments. After all, the long princess did not have her husband, Morton Don Clay, died. So seriously immersed in the infinite mourning, she even attended, no, it should be said that he presided over the final ceremony of Fukai, and like a wife to wear a long sword for him, kiss his lips<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan moved his lips, he felt pain, but couldn’t say anything<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How," said Princess Ang, "Would you like to go?" She lifted her lower jaw, even though she was sitting and Dylan stood. Her posture is still much higher than Dylan. "Let your mother fight alone?" She looked out the window. "Or you can go to your Thunderbolt, and then the next time you come back, if John doesn't directly let His guards cut your head in Thunder, then you may see a crow standing on my shoulder and trying to get rid of my eyes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please don't say anything like this," Dylan said. "I only have you!" He couldn't help but tremble as soon as he thought about it. He had lost one and could no longer lose another.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We all have only each other"Princess Long An stood up, her eyes were rarely filled with tears. She is a stubborn and cold woman. She always regards tears as a symbol of weakness, no matter how much criticism of her in the kingdom, or Hey, she is using a scornful laugh as a weapon to fight back - Dylan is the first time she sees her crying in front of him, he bows his head and knows that he has no retreat<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let my Master return to Fort Lauderdale," Dylan whispered. "I may need some help, and I may not be able to stay too long.""This winter seems to be a bit later than in the past. When the Master of Thunderbolt returned to him a few days ago, Thunderbolt has not yet lowered the first snow. The tribes of the orcs seem to be very quiet. They have taken a lot of Human slaves, some speculate that they may not be able to move this winter, nor before, when the orcs encounter snowstorms, so that when the fighting power is insufficient in the coming year, they will delay one year, the pressure of the second year may be Will increase, but it doesn't matter, then Norman King has already settled<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan looked at his mother, maybe the next time he returned to the kingdom was sitting on the throne was her mother, but if she did not succeed As she said, King John will hang her outside the city gate, and his knight will go to Thunderbolt to cut his head overnight or escort him back to the kingdom - this was originally a battle of life and death. I can't help but hesitate—he knows that there are a lot of people who are dissatisfied with King John, but he also knows that more people are more inclined to be loyal to a man. If he is, even if he can't take the power of the Master group for a while, a man Identity is also enough to make the balance of power tend to be on one side instead of John.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only need youPrincess Yan An said that she took her son’s face and kissed his cheek repeatedly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John King wants to hang the Princess Angkor, and Dylan Don Clay, but he knows this It’s hard that the casters in Norman’s capital are almost all recruited by Dylan. His Chamber of Commerce is almost all the businessmen involved. When John is far away from the throne, he is his own. The nephew has such power to rejoice and regard him as his right arm, but now these people, money and weapons have become the blades hanging on the head of John. He killed Fukai and thought they would change. It’s so weak and flinching – it seems like this, Princess Chang’an accepted his statement, and the embarrassed husband was sentenced to “five penalties”, that is, first castration, then cut off his tongue and nose, dug his eyes, and then knock Broken bones of the limbs, tied to the wheel, exposed to the square, accepting the resentment of the people, and finally solving him Down, pull the hands and feet in five directions and pull them in five directions until they are pulled apart. Five penalties will only be used to punish the civilians who killed the king or the duke, just like the original Byrdwin, if He did not escape. He should accept this long torture. This is very unfair to the nobleman, but John just wants to turn this matter through as soon as possible, so he is thinking about the application documents without hesitation. Signed my name<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process, Princess Ao’an was present and watched as seriously as a wonderful drama, even if there were occasions, no matter the scene or the smell I hate, but John Wang thinks that she still guessed it, or someone confessed that she, and her son, and Fu Kai, were planning to kill themselves. He had a nightmare, and in the nightmare, Princess An Chang’s personally He took the torture tool to squeeze his head. When he woke up, he felt the pain of jumping and jumping. He sat on the bed, picked up the jug, slammed a large mouthful of winter wine, and then took it again. The pills donated by the ministers are said to be a kind of medicine that can cure all kinds of diseases and strengthen the body. It is mixed with honey, which is sweet and pleasant to eat, and its effect is really unusual. Every time John King swallows it, he can think of various kinds. All sorts of wonderful and wise ideas<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the power that Dylan has in his hands, there is another one that will hinder his plan. He has no son, Norman’s only heir to the throne, especially the male only Dylan, Dylan is an adult, and He can become a mage and he is destined that he will not be an idiot - he can kill the princess, even though the woman can inherit the Norman throne, but the stubborn old man is there, but if he wants to die Lun - there must be opposition, he can put him under house arrest, and he can deprive him of his power and status, but he can't kill Dylan, because if he really can't give birth to his son because of weakness, and ... daughter, then Dylan is no doubt about the heir they want to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John King jumped up and threw the jug into the wall, and the woman around him had already curled up in the shadow of the bed with a blanket, she suffered Numerous beatings taught her how to protect herself - very ridiculous, Norman’s current rulers will remember not to touch their stomachs even if they are drunk, because the priests of Greedy have said that honor The goddess will throw seeds into these fertile fields at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at King John like a whirlwind of riots and ruined everything he could get. The heart was sad and hateful, she hated herself. Parents, brothers, because they gave a devil, but also hated the innocent and weak self, but she still did not have enough courage to resist the crowned thug, and strode over his bloodshot eyes. When she grabbed her hair and forced her to stand up, she only trembled and closed her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John’s hand fell on the flat belly, how much he hoped it would be able to swell overnight, but this kind of thing probably even The sacred goddess could not do it. He suddenly grabbed a handful, leaving a trace of red on his white skin and soft nails. The woman screamed in pain, and the first line of light passed over John. thought of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, people heard a message that surprised them and confused them - King John declared that his son did not die, the previous death was only In order to allow the young and innocent child to escape the poisonous hand of the wicked, he summoned the people under the tower of the royal family and showed a child to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But that child is really dead." Dylan said inexplicably, if even this important intelligence would be mistaken, then Princess Ang and Princess Di The "hounds" raised by Lun should be made into dried meat strips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does it matter?" Princess Ang’s princess understood the plan of King John with a little thought: "The child is still so small, whether it is his or not." As long as he admits that the child is Norman’s first heir, not me, and you, Dylan, you still don’t understand, he will start, and when we die, the child will die. After that, he just waited patiently for his many loves to have a son or a daughter. We need to speed up the action.” The woman showed her decisive decision. She chose secret support at the age of Princess Leona. At that time, the old king, who was not eye-catching at the time, did not hesitate to fall to King John instead of Leona after the death of Lao Wang. Now, for her, she and Fu Kai’s son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process, Princess An Chang’s presence was as serious as watching a wonderful drama, even if there were occasions, no matter the scene or smell It’s disgusting, but John Wang thinks that she still guessed it, or someone confessed that she, and her son, and Fu Kai’s son, were always planning to kill themselves. He had a nightmare, and his dreams were long. The princess personally took the torture tool to squeeze his head. When he woke up, he felt that there was a pain in the jump. He sat on the bed, picked up the jug, and slammed a large mouthful of winter wine, and then took it again. The pills that the jesters have offered are said to be a kind of medicine that can cure all kinds of diseases and strengthen the body. They are mixed with honey, which is sweet and pleasant to eat, and its effect is really unusual. Every time John King swallows it, he can think of it. A variety of wonderful and wise ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pill quickly played its role, and John was caught in a sense of pleasure, he was only wearing long underwear, bare legs and feet, drugs Let him not feel cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the power that Dylan has in his hands, there is another one that will hinder his plan. He has no son, Norman’s only The heir to the throne, especially the male only Dylan, Dylan is an adult, and he can become a mage, he is destined that he will not be an idiot - he can kill the princess, although now women can inherit the throne of Norman But the stubborn old guy is a lot of people, but if he wants to kill Dylan - there must be someone who opposes, he can put him down on his nephew, he can also deprive him of his power and status, but he can't kill Dylan because if He really can't give birth to his son because of weakness, and ... daughter, then Dylan is no doubt, the heir they want to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
