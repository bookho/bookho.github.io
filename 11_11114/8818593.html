			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enchanted Mithril chain was eventually acquired by a wandering knight - he is not the strongest, but usually the overly expensive reward has its symbolic meaning. The knight who has not yet sworn an oath to someone may be considered willing to be loyal to the person who gave him the honor, and the knights who have already given their swords and shields to their lords, grand princes or kings accept this. Their gifts, their loyalty will be questioned - after all, in the realization of people, a real knight can not accept such a big favor but do not consider how to compensate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon is certainly not satisfied with this result, he did not even try to recruit the wandering knight, in the following celebrations, he had to apply a small spell Let yourself smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the literary and mundane thoughts that Demon thinks are ridiculous and boring, he was resolutely canceled, such as a couple sharing a colander to drink a pot of soup, etc. I don't think that this woman with a fairy bloodline will be a smart person who can keep pace with him. He doesn't need such a smart person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that some processes can’t be omitted. On this continent where mortals and gods are closely related, there are probably only animals, slaves, and goblins without marriage and family concepts. Will ignore any gods and go to the ground to mix and match, to raise their little scorpion - but as a caster, Demon can only say that he has at least the most basic respect for the gods - elves and half-elves Instead, he will swear by the god of life, Angris, when he marries his lover, but Demon does not want to hear this. He does not like Rosada, which has been in the White Tower for nearly a thousand years, but if it is in Woking. It was a bit ironic to complete his wedding in the temple. Finally, he decided to sacrifice to the god of marriage and life, Greed, and to seek her protection of marriage and children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred years ago, the gods worshipped when people entered into a marriage contract were Fro, because marriage is the crystallization of love, wanting to have children When the woman prayed to Jammu, because the benevolent goddess witnessed the breeding and growth of each seed, but I don’t know when from the temple of Fro, you can only see the men who came to have fun. Like the shackles that depend on the survival of the former, and the priests of Fro who are hardly different from the cockroaches... No one knows when and since, the girls and women who pray for love, marriage and even their children. People began to sacrifice and worship Gerdi, a powerful and mysterious female god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greedy is a god who loves darkness and flames. Her temples are all made of black stone, except for the huge iron casting threshold. There are narrow vents on the top of the wall. Natural light is difficult to penetrate into it. It can only be lit by hot torches, stoves and cetyl wax lamps. Her pastors wear bright red silk gowns, wear jewelry, and wear them. Painted with a strong smell of balm, both men and women are strong and arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her human form, her icon, has a glamorous head and a graceful body – except for her abdomen, the tall, tall belly that looks like a shredded mud pill. The circular shape of the rule, the distortion of the bulge throughout the sphere, as if bred to destroy the entire city or the country's monsters, neither proportional nor aesthetic, but when they are combined, people will Uncontrollably, I can’t help but be able to leave the eccentricity and leave the ugly and beautiful body for even a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone altar that precedes the icon can easily place a bull or a giant bear with a wide, deep blood trough. Twelve iron rings are fixed on the edge - the priests of Greedy join forces to send a pregnant ewes to the altar, tie the four hooves of the rope on the iron ring, let it lie on his back, revealing Out of the swollen and cleaned abdomen, the ewes screamed and shed tears, as if they had already speculated on their unfortunate fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gredi's priest holds a black obsidian knife and slowly and smoothly cuts off the ewe's belly - in fact, only the one that has just gone A knife needs a little effort, this ewes have a lot of sheep, and its skin and muscles have been stretched and tight, and in the end it is almost cracked by itself - the priest will smile with a smile Into the ewe's **, the fetus that has long hair but does not open his eyes, and then one is... a whole two! The crowd of people gathered their hands in joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are they so happy?" Kreima whispered, he and Baldwin, Kerry Ben are VIPs, fortunate enough to be cruel. The strange program is at the forefront - not so good, the air in the temple is always hot and turbid, coupled with the blood and viscera of the sacrifices, the smell of faeces and urine, the precious spices that the priests put into the stove, The body odor and bad breath of human beings...etc., when mixed together, can almost let a healthy and strong giant suffocate and die. "Oh, yes, you are not married yet," Birdwin said, raising his hand as if to touch his beard It is to put the lavender bag hidden in his pocket under the nose: "They are praying for Gree to bless the marriage of the newlyweds as soon as possible to bring as many children as possible - it can be said to be a divination, He watched the priest throw the ewes and their lambs, which had not yet died completely, in a blood-impregnated black-colored rattan basket, and then sent it to the other, and the priest only took it from its belly. There was a little lamb in the crowd, and people sighed with disappointment: "The people who enter into the marriage contract need to offer gold and pregnant animals to the temple. Sheep, deer, horses or bears can be used. The pastors will look at Greed. Cut down their stomachs, the number of children in the belly is the number of their children in the future - if there are many, then the most is the number." He looked at the bottom of the altar, nearly a hundred big belly The ewe and the doe are together, they are around Those who have been used up and discarded, the hooves are high and the lambs are not dead. They are squirming, struggling, shaking their noses and mouths, as if they are taking the last calories from the mother's cold body. Milk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that White Tower's new consul is quite confident in his male abilities." Birdwin was half-satisfied and said with disgust: "He must have wanted a big number."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Badwin said, all pregnant ewes and female deer were slaughtered, and the priest dug out four slicks from the belly of a screaming doe. The deer fetus, this is the most one, she further pulled out the doe's **, turned to find the hot placenta, and forced the unmanned ampoules to eat with the help of Demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crimmar squinted, he turned his head, Kerry was watching all this, cobalt blue eyes filled with no words The mercy of the table - but he does not know who this mercy belongs to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people couldn’t help but feel relieved when they were able to leave the temple of Gredi. The fresh air outside was a good medicine for help, and the people walked beside them. Full of joy, talking about the four children that the lord and the consul will have, because the four deer are three male and one female, so they also think that Anzhen and Demon will have three sons and one daughter, some insist They will have a daughter first, and some will decide that the daughter will be born after the three brothers grow up, but most of them are men, and their wives are on the other side, vying for the priest of Gredi. Apprentices buy ewes, female deer and their children who are cut open, and according to the priest's words, they can nourish the body and enhance their fertility, especially those little scorpions, you want to have a strong son, Take a little male scorpion, you want to have a beautiful daughter, then this little female deer with big eyes can really be suitable for you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a dinner party," Birdwin grumbled at his unkempt but shiny dark gray curly hair: "I suspect Demon is planning to do it." The meat of the dinner was not enough to make the best decision - to be honest, I am a little bit mad at anything he has taken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I have I heard that...the grown-up," said Ai Ai, a young knight, who was one of Birdwin’s envy, "they...will be invited at the dinner party...Fro's pastor."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, this may not," Birdwin said to him with a deep blink of an eye: "Well, I am sure I will go to the dinner party, and will take you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young knight is blushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
