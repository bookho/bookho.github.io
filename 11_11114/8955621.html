			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luzer’s Great Highway Dee noticed that the thin man and the woman had a different appearance when he mentioned the 500,000 gold coins; In contrast, the caster and the elf are completely indifferent, yes, he thinks, except for the dragon and the dwarf, there is no race that is richer than the elves, but the dwarfs who are able to excavate gems, gold and silver are good at The plundering dragons, like their lives, don’t mind getting more – of course, only life and virtue can shake the elves, which is mentioned more than once in the poet’s verse - Luzer’s Dagong thought, his territory covered the white tower and the hill, and the lord there, his courtier, left two blood, one of which was mixed with the blood of the elf. . He had hoped that they could kill each other and kill him so that he could take back the White Tower and the hills. What he didn't expect was that the girl named An Zhen would be stupid enough to give him and his enemies with his hands. And the male heir, the one named Demon, is like a locust, swallowing the vitality of the White Tower quickly and insanely - there are already several leaders of the guild to complain to the Grand Duke Luzer, they are to Germany There are countless bribes, but their caravans will still be looted, blackmailed, and blackmailed; even if it is white, members of the Thieves Guild dare to walk on the wide streets, and their shops and warehouses become semi-public sales. Their wives and children cannot be guaranteed in the city, and they are always at risk of losing their chastity and even their lives. Their sons, adults or underages, are not led by the priests of Fro to the absurd astray, or semi-forced. The land became the "crib" of the guild, and they were beaten to steal, looting and murder - if a businessman wants to take his son home, he would have to make a huge ransom that would make him ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke Luzer is very dissatisfied and dissatisfied. He wants to get back a lively, rich and stable white tower instead of a thief. The thief's nest occupied by the guild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the king of Norman Norman, ah. Now that the dead Pharaoh is eager to try and want to hit his Oak Valley idea, and he is accidentally caught by him in the battle, Luzer may have issued his orders. Asked Demon to give a reasonable answer - or he had to look at the attitude of the elves, they seem to give up the ampoule, but they are not careful about this group of strong and stubborn non-human cautious Over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your people are there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not bad, Luzer is a big public And laugh. He can now directly test the attitude of the elf: "In the fortress of Fukai," he squeezed his eyes to the elf: "For the property, he is the safest.",<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of the twelve tall towers," Birdwin said, and he looked around: "Fukai is in the northeast." When he wants to elaborate, the long, clear horn sounds through the lavender at dawn. In the sky, there are a few eagle owls that scream through the sky with a whistle that makes a sharp voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They found out," said the Knights of the Highlands Norman and Sir Alex Ferguson: "They are issuing orders and all the gates will be closed."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"喔..." Luzer’s grandfather took a picture of his belly: “I think the most important thing is to hide us, if we stay here. Even the highlands. Norman's knights are really not very good at playing hide and seek, as long as they have eyes, they can also see us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, no need to say more, Crimdale The spell has already begun - the spells he applied to him and Kerry themselves have expired, and they have returned to their original appearance - this time the spell is on several of them, and Luzer is a cold-smelling person, though he Knowing that this may be just his psychological effect, then what he saw made him open his eyes and mouth uncontrollably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you ask, respected mage," he asked strangely, "Are you turning them into hounds?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still you. In addition to the horse, there is only a hound in the horse." Kreima explained: "This is just an illusion, His Royal Highness, a illusion that only works for ordinary people." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It needs to be explained, as we saw earlier. The court of Norman in the Highlands is not so much a palace as a fortress. Like other fortresses, it has tall double walls, arrow towers, sub-towers, and main towers. The inner court, the atrium, the outer court - overlooking the sky, it is like an isosceles trapezoid with an outer contour, the main tower, that is, the tower of the king is located in the inner court, the middle of the lower parallel line of the isosceles trapezoid, and the prison tower Located in the lower left corner of the trapezoid, the small courtyard for storing horses is located at the corner of the prison tower, covered by its shadows. Because the smell is unpleasant, no nobles will be accommodated here. Only the soldiers responsible for the horses here. With the servants, there are very few guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will the horse be better?" Luzer said, looking out at the sink, revealing a silly, khaki-headed head. Trying to shake your ears, they slammed and stood up. "I like horses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can afford a knight who weighs three hundred pounds after wearing armor," Gülen said: "I don't mind the idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mei Xiaodi exclaimed, although her shouts in people other than Kreima sounded like a puppy barking in a bark - a dog came to sniff her, affectionately I want to lick her nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am so happy that you are still so flattering," said the thief. "Oh, no, please dog."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't talk," said Kerry Ben, the ear of the elf allowed him to hear more. "Someone is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Dazer Luzer felt a bit unfair, because Kerry was a pretty pretty hound, black, and long and thin. The trimmed ears are straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s knights hurried in. They shouted at the dog’s servants, only to find that they were drunk and finally woke up one of them. And ordered him to take the dog and track the sinners who escaped. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br I stumbled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to this dog?" A knight who was about to start the horse suddenly asked with suspicion: "Is it hurt, was it bitten by another dog?" "He pointed to Mei Mi. Mei Mei wanted to hide but it was already late. The dog's servant glanced at her vaguely. He didn't remember having such a dog." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's no longer useful." Another knight said that he pulled out his sword and went to the dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gray dog ​​that suddenly jumped out of front of him, it was skinny and gray. But the huge head and the exposed snow and bright teeth still scared the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, adults, 10,000 sorry!" The servant of the dog rushed over: "I will give them a few whip at once! This group Animals, you have to get a whip to obey..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it." The Cavaliers who had previously discovered that Mei Mei had something wrong said: "That might be it. Love," he said jokingly. "Maybe still have its puppy licking it - don't waste time on the dog, we should go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;His companion stunned the sword and jumped on his horse. "Don't make a mistake." He warned: "The mood of the king is not so good. His iron chair is still missing a few pieces of human skin. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servant of the dog shuddered. He originally wanted to say that his dog group seems to have several more dogs. What can he do now? I don't want to say it anyway - it's all dogs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin returned to the dog, the cold sweat soaked his robes, "How am I doing?" He asked casually: "Return Is it like a dog?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the scene just now is ridiculous. Baldwin is a tall adult male with thick hands and feet. He doesn’t know him. The image of the outside is what it looks like. He can only bend his knees and put his hands together. It’s like a real dog yelling at the knight—this is undoubtedly a shame for a former lord, a lord who once sat on the same long table with the king and drank a golden cup. Mocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody said anything, they followed the dog group, the sky was already lit, only some dark corners needed torch lighting, if not in the courtyard Come to see the new king's nobility, they may have been discovered by the mages who are exploring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we mix in between them?" Mei Mi asked, several times the guards and the Cavaliers passed her by. She is almost scared to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are allowed to come in, but may not be allowed to go out." Gülen said, "The dog may not be." He did not quite understand why the caster wanted Set their illusion as a group of dogs, and now he understands a bit. When chasing the escaped criminals, the only ones who rushed out of the city gate except the knights and guards were the dogs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope they won't bring a mage." Mei Mi said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Master will not act with those inferior people." Dazer Luzer said that he also raised several powerful casters and knew their The eyes will almost never look down, but this time if he can go back. He can remind them of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pale golden morning light finally casts on the entire court, and the illusion is about to expire, Kremar has given up the original idea and started preparing another spell. At the command of the Cavaliers, the back door opened and they rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost made the difference, and Birdwin looked back at Wang Ting's last look. He saw a solid wall and what was shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking at? My nephew?" Duke, no, the new king of Norman in the Highlands asked him, along the line of Dylan Don Clay’s sight. Looking down, I saw only a large group of dogs mad, followed the Cavaliers and guards out of the court: "It’s weird," he said. "How can they disappear without a trace?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan Donkley looked up and looked at the magical galaxy that had already been like a pale imprint in the morning light: "Who knows," he said perfunctorily: There are always some whimsy available."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New King frowned: "Sometimes you guys are really annoying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not very good," Dylan said. "Don't you always want to form a mage group?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...but..." The new king didn't pay attention, or he noticed but didn't care - the topic was transferred to the place he was interested in, so he took his own nephew Intimacy with him side by side down the walls, all the way off the reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape from the court is only the first step, the periphery of Wang Ting is twelve high The masonry of the tower and the wall connecting them, on the outskirts of the masonry, there are outer walls and moats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the king of Norman in the Highlands thought so, if anyone wanted to kill him and his descendants as he killed the owner of the castle. It is necessary to first cross a moat that is as wide as a starlight, and then crush the solid outer wall, and then he will also greet the knights and soldiers stored in the twelve towers, and finally the more powerful and firm Wang Ting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but time has passed for a long time, even though Wang Tingli still lives with his descendants, the twelve towers still live with the descendants of his courtiers, but then The loyalty of the people is far less stable than their ancestors. They have their own ideas and have their own demands. In this chaotic and critical moment, they are eager to face the new king and quietly gather their own. The soldiers did not use all their power to hunt down the murderers who had murdered Pharaoh, as New King had hoped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the Dagong who escaped, which made them feel more excited. In the reward given by the new king, there were only 10,000 gold coins for the murderer of the Pharaoh, and 100,000 gold coins for the Luzer Grand Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe we can get more, they said privately, if they really caught the road to escape, Luzer, can you take it? Taking all the ransoms, it was revealed that the ransom of Luzer’s Grand Duke was as high as 500,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the murderer of the murderer, even the new king is not so concerned, although many people think that this poor guy is only crowned. Jun Jun’s crimes - after all, he did not have the slightest motive to murder the pharaoh. All his things were given by the pharaoh, and he lost the pharaoh. Just like now, he has to flee like a mourning dog to avoid the new king. The noose and the axe fell on his neck - but in any case, since the new king has said so, he has been deprived of all honors and status, and the surname has become a sinner, then he is a sinner . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will speak for a serf child? No, there are many people who want to hang him by hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Wang Ting, several people in Bedwin were consciously quietly away from the mad dog group, between Wang Ting and the Twelve Towers. In the hills and hills, according to the orders of the kings, the trees that could be used to build the siege equipment were not allowed, but the shrubs were really lush and very strong. They quickly hid in them, and in a while their illusions also failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the tower of Fukai." Dazer Luzer said that they were only a few hundred feet away from them: "But it must have been strictly guarded. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not difficult to get in touch with the courtiers of Luzer’s grandfather. Although Kerry’s Ji Yun is delicate and violent, the necessary moments are also very Reliable, it took away the seal ring of Dagong, and quickly brought back the reply given by the Dagong Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will come to greet me, we," said Dagong: "But he said, they are also taken care of, although he can still act, but the highlands The Normans will not allow us to leave here - before my ransom has entered the new king's inner library."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to go through four lanes City gates, and a suspension bridge," said Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
