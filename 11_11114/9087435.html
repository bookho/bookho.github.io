			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a two-in-one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Right,” Perant said. “Maybe you are willing to meet another old Friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Kerry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another plane, almost all boats using propellers There are ballast tanks. These compartments, which have nothing but water, are indispensable. The weight of the ballast water can increase the weight of the hull when the vessel is not carrying the cargo, ensuring that the propeller can penetrate below the water surface. Guaranteed propulsion efficiency, and can also reduce the unpleasant dizziness caused by the hull vibration. If it encounters a storm or strong waves, the crew can also adjust the weight division and draft of the cabin through ballast water to ensure the depth of the cabin. The stability and travel safety of the vessel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plane, probably only the gnomes will use metal to make the ship, and add a propeller behind the ship, but this is a new for the gnomes Toys, for the time being, humans dare not try to entrust their lives and goods to the kind of grotesque stuff - most ships, as we have described before, mostly use wood materials, only partially covering lead Plates or iron plates, but they also use ballast. The bottom compartment of the ship is filled with large wooden barrels that can hold the next adult or two adults. The barrels contain potatoes, onions, and non-perishable citrus. Pineapple with iron nails and light wine (because fresh water is easily spoiled), etc. These things can not only eat and drink, but also play the role of ballast water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that there are no ships carrying fresh water. They either buy the seaweed from the fisherman’s water, or use the water polo to ensure the water quality during the voyage. It can keep the original clean, but the clean water algae can always breed quickly, and people need to keep cutting and picking up the separately grown parts. Otherwise, even the seaweed that is only the palm of the hand can be packed at night. An entire wooden barrel, as for the water polo, to purify so much water is not a colorless tourmaline or a stone, plus the secret silver shell and enchantment, this price can only be borne by the aristocrats and thieves who are extravagant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves never use the fish and snake people, nor do they use the light wine as a water reserve. The water buckets they use to store fresh water need only a little bit of water from the spring of life. There will be no rancid deterioration within six months. In addition, although the water polo is rare, every flying wing ship is equipped with such a piece - but this time they brought an extra wooden barrel, and the shape of the wooden barrel is also Very strange, to be exact, it is more like a large bathtub with a folding lid, large enough to allow a rhinoceros to bathe in it, and it is not placed in the bottom compartment, but fixed next to the captain's room, Perrin When they took them with them, the lid opened halfway, and the golden sunlight was shining on the water, sparkling, like piles of crystal powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world looked at Kerry Ben, and Kerry Ben also looked over. The Elf Ranger’s lips were covered with a surprise smile, obviously he I have already guessed who this guest is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant went over and knocked on the barrel, there was a lot of water in the barrel, something swiftly swam up, they first looked It was a black, round nose, then a gray, rounded, thick beard, followed by a furry, serious white face and two black bean-like eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" it said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White face!" The soul of the alien world is happy to say that he almost extended his hand without thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White face swam up in a belly-up manner, holding his hand with the small claws of two flesh, the claws of the otter and the human There are five fingers, the fingers are gray and the fingers are very beautiful pink, and one of them is like a human thumb, born on the side, with the effect of a human thumb, so the white face grabs the stone, The fish and the child can be firmly grasped, never lost, and now its hands hold the fingers of the alien soul, just like being held by an innocent baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's how to convince you," said Kerry Ben. Perant is a druid, for any cage, net, fence... In short, all the things used to imprison freedom are abhorrent. He is very curious about how the white face conveys Perant to bring it in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't bring it," Perant said helplessly: "I don't know when it climbed our ship and it took up a fresh water." Bucket, when I found it, it was stealing our dried fish and sweet jam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I found the white face, its state was not the best. The fur of the mink was ribbed, and the eyes were dull. Pelant immediately gave it a spoonful of potion, and finally restored it to the original state of jumping. As for the vat, the elves urgently gave it a special order. Every half of the day or a night, the wizard changed it to the fresh star-light river. The elves went fishing in the rushing river five or six times a day. It is a squid, as long as it comfortably waits for a big flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"vip treatment, huh?" The soul of the alien world whispered, the watery white face stayed in his hood, rubbing himself with his hair Beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may have heard that I will meet you." Perant said that the white-faced family was brought to the silver-crowned jungle, he and Ruiwen There is a quiet and clean stream below the residence, the fish and shrimp inside are stupid and fat, but for a few months... the size of the otter family has grown considerably, especially the white face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God," they heard the black hair caster behind him saying, "My neck is almost broken, white face, you have now Multiple? Fifty pounds or one hundred pounds? When I first hugged you, I realized that although the otter has no waist, what is the extra lap? Really... you sometimes feel your own Is the fur a little tight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant and Kerry are not stopping, but they are holding their breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bird’s squeaking snoring in the next moment, this is the sound of the otter’s anger, and the tragic cry of one or two singers . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, okay," After a while, Perant transferred the angry otter to his shoulder while pulling it from his mouth. Out of Kreima's finger: "This can't be eaten." He said seriously: "How about grilled fish? Anyway, our chef is back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to show that he is indeed repenting - although the soul of the opposite world has not said anything wrong, the otter of this plane is obviously the same taboo as the woman of the other plane, even if the conditions on board are limited, the caster of the black hair It’s still a great showcase of another country’s quintessence. It’s a pity that the white face still refuses to put its little claws in the half-elves after a meal that makes all the elves on the boat can’t help but move. In the hands of forgiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The otters finally agreed to reconcile on the morning of the third day, they are leaving, the pale golden morning light is covered with the smooth and expansive deck of the flying wing ship, the white sails and the flank are shaking in the wind, humming, elves They sing softly in the wind, bid farewell to their people and friends, and love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White face sits on the deck, the tail is placed on the feet, the claws are hung on the chest, its look can be said to be unprecedentedly serious, it not only forgives Kreima also wiped his beard on his cheeks - this is a very grand ceremony for the otters, but no one can match Perant, the white face is in love with him. Even Ruiwen can't help but smile in the unavoidable worries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If not..." Ruiwen said: "I will go with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes," said Perant, the female powerhouse in the elves is no longer a minority, and Revan has fought side by side with Perant numerous times: "Only this time." He stared at the eyes of Revin, Perant's The eyes are gray-blue, and in strong light it even loses that blue color and turns into a very light gray, which makes him look a bit cold and inaccessible, but now they reflect the double blue and green of Ruiwen Like the eyes of the summer lake, it is also a layer of gentle color, they are four eyes, followed by a gentle but full of emotional kisses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White face looked at it with enthusiasm, until Kremar took a bag of honey fish to attract its attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This brings back to your sons." The soul of the opposite world said: "I will leave for a long time, but I will go back."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White face snorted a few times, I will meet you, it says, it knows that this human sometimes understands what it is saying, sometimes not, just like Now, but it knows that he misses the Starlight River, the eucalyptus forest and the river beach that is often flooded by the river. It also thinks about the cold water, the sweet sap, and the grilled fish of this guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it doesn't matter, maybe the second time, or the third time, when the Starlight River skyrockets, they will be back there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is their home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the high-level positioning transmission spell was cast by an Elf Mage, and he blinked at Kerry Bun when he was finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar looked at Kerry in a curious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My..." Kerry was a little embarrassed to say: "In terms of human terms, it should be my uncle."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant turned his head and smiled. The elf’s adulthood is not as good as human beings. It always maintains a childlike posture. Their gestation period is three times that of human beings. But it takes only twenty years to grow up to a teenager. The problem is that during Kerry's childhood, the Singer elves had only about a hundred younger descendants. They were treated with the most meticulous and proper care, but in contrast, there were countless jokes and blacks. history. For example, when Kerry was seeing Perant as a red deer or a black bear, it would be so unnatural for a moment, because he was the most ignorant of the first forty years, and there were several cold winters buried in Uncle Pertant. Spend in the fur, not to mention the elated climbs and rides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his uncle, he is holding another handle - he is also one of the elves who care for Kerry Ben, like all the casters who are willing to look after the young children. Like that, the most common method they use is juggling, but let him say, Kerry this childhood... that's a bit...not ordinary...silly...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of the jungle, Ingewei’s hand has a black record called Kerry’s growth log, which is a stupid black record for the little fool. The record is the little guy’s uncle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has gently grasped the little scorpion hanging down the corner. If he can, he will try to ask Wan Weilin this time, hehe, Although his father is not very likely to hide it there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where they fell is a jungle, because the snow cover swamp is a giant chaotic lock that naturally formed before the catastrophe thousands of years ago, no one knows How long it is to extend out of the tentacles, so the elf masters positioned in order to prevent their accidents from being located hundreds of miles away from the snow cover marsh, there is a valley, inaccessible, anyway The elves have prepared enough food, scrolls, and water for them, and there is a druid around them, no need to consider the problem of supply scarcity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "About another one (one hour) dusk is coming here," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are here for a night off." Kerry Ben looked at the people around him, and Kreima, he and Perant were all fine. Gülen was able to walk freely in a strange place with weak light, but Leona It’s not very likely with Birdwin. The gnome McGee, who spent his two days on the flying wing, was full of enthusiasm and fear, because he was the first to see the flying wing with the touch of the elf. The fear is that the relationship between the elves and the gnomes is not so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I am a dwarf..." he muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elves will be happy to hang you upside down and hang under the keel until you scream and blow dry - like the Highlands The Normans are doing the dry chicken," said Gülen. When the voice just fell, he responded agilely back. If not, his toes would be cut off by the steel heel of the gnome boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't think I am an idiot," said the gnome: "The elves don't eat meat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp But this statement was broken tonight, and Perant’s animal friends sent a lot of nuts. Leona inserted the vine’s rattan cakes with branches and fixed them around the campfire to heat them. Lan went to fetch water. When Kreima’s clean water ball swayed in the water bladder and provided them with hot and clean water, McGee thought that their dinner was like this, but the rattan cake was almost ready. At the time, Perant came out of the darkness, and a colorful snake was hanging on his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" McGee asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Snake," Perant said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now the snake should not hide in the cave?" Gülen asked, he had not left the port of Mind before he met Kreima, but Thieves also often use non-toxic or poisonous snakes to intimidate and assassinate, so he is no stranger to snakes. He knows that snakes at this time should hide in their own homes, and a druid will not take a snake from It came out of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It attacked us." Kerry Ben said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it smells like a delicious food, so think that playing a tooth festival is more important than sleep? Gülen was very fond of making a joke, but the two elves didn't look very good. He closed his mouth wisely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What are you doing?” the gnome asked with a sharp scream, and anyone could hear some fear from his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dinner." Birdwin said, looking at him strangely, since Perant brought it back - is it still ready to find Cranvo? Did the pastor pray for it? He was a hunter. Norman in the Highlands rarely saw snakes, but there were many dragon fire islands, and peeling the bones to the internal organs, a snake and a deer did not make any difference to him. He simply processed it and left only Some of the snake meat, snake skin and bones are all buried deep underground, so that bloody smells attract more beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake meat is simply rinsed with water, cut into small pieces and then inserted into the branch frame to slowly roast the oil on the campfire, Leona’s pocket In addition to the fine salt, there are also greasy spices. In a short while, the golden snake smells a restless fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome McGee didn't immediately send his own one to his mouth, he turned his eyes and looked at the people around him...and the elves? His eyes are wide open. The nearest to Longhuo Island is the Jade Forest Island. The elves of the Jade Forest Island absolutely refuse meat. Their sensitive tongues even put a teaspoon of cattle in a bucket of vegetable soup. The oil is tasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, McGee?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McKay didn't talk, but Kerry Ben and Perant is not surprised that his pair is almost an eye with doubts and fears. After all, in the minds of many humans and humans who don’t know too much about the elves, the elves are similar to bees, only relying on dew and nectar. It is very good to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the Singer, or the elves who were not Singer’s elves at the time, did reject any meat entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the great catastrophe before the millennium, the connection of the main material plane was greatly affected, and even the elves could not hear the voice of Angris. The elves have disagreed in this regard. In order to avoid the imminent civil war, they resolutely divided into two, that is, the current Singer and Eya spirits, the Eya spirits stayed on the Emerald Island, and the Singer elves left the homeland all the way north. The silver-crowned jungle was not an elf at the time, they were brutal orcs. It is conceivable that there was confusion and pain at that time. The young elves almost died. The adult elves also fell into a predicament because they were indefinitely, hunger and cold, and even unable to raise their swords and arrows. Since then, the recipes have changed. Unlike the Eya spirits, which occupy the warm and humid Emerald Forest Island in the four seasons, in the winter, they are surrounded by ice and snow, and the elves begin to hunt animals like the orcs. Their fur, eat their flesh, and survive as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry was only a baby who needed only milk. When he grew up, the Singer elves had become the owners of the Silver Crown, but occasionally he had heard of it - just like his uncle laughed. His father, the king of the jungle, in order to ensure that his ethnic group can survive, is the first elf to put the flesh of the creature on his plate, although at that time he seems ordinary, even elegant and calm. I ate a piece of roast venison that was as big as a fist. In fact, after the meal was finished, he presided over three meetings and announced a verdict and interrogated the five orcs, but the king of the jungle in the night spent a night of light wine in his room, not to mention Do not sleep for several days in a row—the slenderness of the elf is not only in the body, but in the soul. How many Singer elves are crying and forcing themselves to swallow the first bloody food? The number cannot be counted at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s much better than an adult elf, or a baby or a toddler. The Singer will consciously put a very small amount into their food. The gravy, when they grow up, resists meat and is not as strong as their parents, although if they can, they will use the flowers and fruits of the plant as the main source of food - but this is limited to the summer and autumn, winter The output of the spring plants is not enough to meet the needs of the elves, and it is necessary to survive the long and harsh winter, without fat and meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the elves don’t have the hobby to advertise their intimacy, so until now only a small part knows that the Singer and Eya spirits are different recipes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake meat is very delicious, but the two elves only eat one piece, the soul of the outside world just tastes a few mouthfuls, and Birdwin’s appetite is tall with him. The strong body is directly proportional, but the slim Gülen and the pygmy McGee are surprisingly eating food that has almost half the weight of their body. For the gnome's gluttony, Kerry is already heard, but he remembers Gülen. I didn't have such a good appetite before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the elf’s eyes fell on Gülen, the thief almost shivered uncontrollably, since he was killed by the stranger, and the handle After the dagger became strange again, he realized that his appetite was growing constantly - his original food was like plum, but now he has no problem if he wants to swallow a plum, like a burning sensation With a tingling sensation like an ant biting his stomach, on several occasions he suspected that he would die because of a belly-throat, and the scene of half-dissolved food flowing out of the cracked belly after death was in his nightmare. Oh, even if he doesn't have to fear death now, that kind of situation will still make him shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if he kills the man with the dagger, no matter who he is, the dangerous hunger will fade, and if he kills more in a short time, the feeling will become more and more slight. Slightly until he can stay up late for a few nights and nights - he once heard that a powerful thief has a dagger that can draw vitality from others. If he is injured, he will puncture the dagger into a living person's body. The latter's energy can flow into his body and heal his wounds - Gülen suspects that his dagger is this, but the legend does not describe that the dagger will make its owner feel extremely hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he thought so, he heard a sharp and small laugh, but the sound was like coming out of his brain, which contained The scorn and ridicule are even more intense than the night at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glan!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked like a stunned person who was suddenly awake from a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't look too good," Perant said. "What happened?" His eyes became sharp: "What did you hear? Or What did you see? Say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, nothing," Gülen was completely awake at this moment, and he slammed his head: "Maybe Because the bonfire is too warm... I think I am asleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will have to travel for a long time," Perant said. I don't want to hide between my peers, which is dangerous for each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe," the thief said: "...a sudden sleepiness?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant knows that this dark-haired thief has not said all the truth, but the current situation does not allow him to destroy the trust relationship that is not so strong. He finally nodded to Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gylan sighed long, and the first day caused the attention of an elf druid not what he wanted: "What happened? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are arranging the order of the vigils," McGee said: "The trio."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
