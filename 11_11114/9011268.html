			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They tapped the door of the barn, but because the door was closed by the power of the spellcaster using magic, everything they did was futile, someone It is proposed to pile up a torch outside the barn and burn the people inside, but someone immediately reminded that there are all the cows in the village. Later, someone suggested that a hole was made from the wall of the barn. A young man can rush in to catch those people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village chief does not want to do this. After all, the barn is his industry, but his daughter will become firm when he thinks about his daughter. Fortunately, before they put the plan into practice, the barn door opened, and an impulsive boy slammed a handle. Fork, they thought that they would hear someone mourn, but the handle was like being caught by an invisible hand and throwing it back. Its handle hit the original owner, and then it was dazzling. The flames, which illuminate the barn at dawn, illuminate the faces of the villagers and adventurers, as well as the weapons of the adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noise suddenly became smaller and even disappeared. The villagers remembered that these adventurers killed nearly fifty goblins and three gnolls - They have never seen such awkward and terrible evil creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a caster among them, a caster who does not dare to offend a nobleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can anyone tell me what happened?" Kerry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villagers looked at the village head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man with a honest and honest face, but in fact quite a bit of traitorous temper, he suddenly felt dry, I want to drink some water, but he can't throw away these guys who are harassing his daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me," Kerry said with a stern sternness: "What makes you treat us like a goblin?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's because...because..." The village chief grabbed the flail, and the flail in the village was certainly not the weapon of the warrior and the knights, just a long handle and a set of flat The farm tools made of bamboo or wooden strips must be very painful for playing the child's ass, but it is a bit ridiculous to say that it is used to deal with the adventurers - but he only hesitated for a short period of time and finally Regardless of shouting: "Because your companion forced my daughter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised a hand. Pointing to the black robes, holding the arm and looking impatient, the thief Gülen: "This guy, this shameless thief, he saw my baby. Just say something dirty to seduce her, in her When she wants to run back to her room, he beat her and forced her to do something between her husband and wife, and took her chastity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bedwin immediately cast a stern look at Gülen. He does not deny that the thief is a powerful helper, but he never trusts the latter's character. So far, he has never seen a thief who really repented and is willing to be a kind and harmless person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Kerry originally looked at Crimal, the caster shook his head and the only thief might leave from them, forcing the little The girl's chance was only after they were asleep, but the barn's door was not locked by a chain or bolted by a bolt, but was locked with magic. Just as the villagers couldn't knock the door with the torch and the iron fork, the thief couldn't use his skill to open the door and sneak out – there was a small window for ventilation in the barn. The problem was that the window could only allow one. The cat was in and out, and the servant of Kremar was shrinking to the size of the finger and screaming there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure that person is Gülen?" Kerry asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We see it with our own eyes." A young man said with anger, he is the girl's admirer, like the other boys in the village, they hope to find it She is her own wife. "I came to the uncle to borrow the iron fork..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My daughter goes to the water every day before dawn, according to reason Say, she should be back when I wake up." The village head said: "But today I searched every corner and couldn't see her shadow. The curse, I thought she was escaped. The goblin was caught, and I and Polly rushed out of the door..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We heard her shouting. But we ran over It’s already late,” added the young man. If his eyes could be turned into sharp edges, then Gülen might have died long ago: “It’s the hybrid,” he vomited on the ground and said, “He is still against us. Smiled. The endless abyss is down, he laughed at us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Their companions have been with us. "Elven ranger said, even if he did not believe Glenn will believe Crane Martha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the village chief yelled angrily. "I already knew that you are just a group!" He waved a flail and almost hit himself, which caused his anger to burn to the apex. They grabbed it, grabbed it, grabbed it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan's face gloomyly lowered his arm, he was not sure if the elf would agree to hand him over, and he I can guarantee that if the elf agrees to hand him over, he will surely ensure that he can't hurt the villagers. Maybe he will order the mage to use the silver string to tie him tightly; and he only has The means that might try to escape from the rope and the prison have already been known to Fro's pastor, she will betray him, and he will not find a chance - too stupid, he will never want to die A group of peasants holding iron forks and flails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he just laughed, because he saw that the caster had made a gesture, not to him but to those odious idiots, magic brought The bigger the flames and the smoke, the villagers screamed in panic, thinking that the Master opened the door to the endless abyss, they pushed each other away, leaving footprints on each other's bodies, and several others were called The weapon stabbed the head and back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ran far away in one breath and waited for a long time, but the flame soon went out, and the smoke dissipated itself after a while, two A daring young man ran sneaking back, and now a figure inside and outside the barn is invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those people ran!" they said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can’t run away," said the village chief, his face turned into a bright sauce red because of his shame: "I will complain to the supervisor. Ask our lords to send his knight to chase these daring wicked people." He took a hard breath and breathed a sigh of relief, so long, he rarely said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the pastor is still alive," said a villager, the pastor of their village unfortunately broke their own when they were looking for a goblin nest for them. Neck, when they found him, he only had a head that was not so delicious. The village chief had to go to the church in Rosada for a few days to pray for a pastor in the village, and to talk about the goblin. thing. Now the goblin is solved, and his daughter has been embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of scars, crying non-stop daughter village chief could not help but have a headache, he went to see his barn. And the cows in the barn, but fortunately they are still safe and sound, he climbed up to the attic to squat, accidentally and delightfully found several embroidered silk face blankets, "Just where they grabbed or Stolen," said the village chief. And decided that if the owners of these blankets came in, he would give them the blanket, but if they didn't know anything about it, then he would leave the blanket as a daughter's dowry - his poor little daughter, little baby. Child, where has she been sinned? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the villagers yelled and ran away, Kerry had started running again - of course, the villagers were in both directions and continued to run The village narrowed down in Mei Mei's eyes until the palm of the hand was so big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro’s priest stopped and slammed into the ground as soon as he stopped. Her chest hurts like she is going to explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this all about?" asked Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not Gülen." The black caster said that the thief bowed shallowly to him and expressed his gratitude: "My eyes are not so bad," Gülen said: "That is just a fat-blooded country girl. If you take a step back, do you still have a Fro priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who knows," Mayi quickly replied: "Maybe you like the country girl - don't you praise her very cute?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I don't think she can match you, dear," said the thief sweetly. "So beautiful, so full, and so cheap. Why should I abandon an apple that is close at hand?" What about the sweet potato that has been slag?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So who are they seeing?" Birdwin said. Similarly, he does not believe in Gülen but he believes Kerry Ben, "is it an illusion made by the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief couldn’t help but hear the term Eyes, he has had enough of the devil or the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so bad." Kerry Ben said: "I think I have got the answer to this question, and it confirms my speculation." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village head wanted to leave immediately and went to find the supervisor to report the matter, but Because even if he rode his old horse, he would have to go to the town where the supervisor is located for three days. So he still needs to prepare water bladders and hard bread. These are all women's work, but he lost his wife very early, and his daughter was frightened and beaten up. He had to prepare these things himself. . At night, he went to find Polly's mother and entrusted her to look after her daughter when he was absent, while Polly was responsible for looking after everyone's cows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to see his baby before going to sleep. The bruise on her face had not all disappeared. The forehead was slightly hot, and occasionally sobbing twice, but it seems that the situation is not very bad, maybe waiting for him from the supervisor. When she came back, she could heal, but she didn't know how long she would wake up from this nightmare, but it doesn't matter. She is still young, time will take away all the bad memories, she will find a good boy to marry and give birth. A child who is playing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village chief’s house is the largest in the entire village, but like other villagers, in order to save charcoal and safety, in fact, the family always lives in one In the big room, in the middle is a hearth that serves as both a lighting and a fire stove. What is special about it is that the village chief has laid a bed for his little daughter, especially in the corner of the house, which is covered with thick Straw, there is a bed sheet and wool felt instead of a blanket, which is simply extravagant for them. Even the bed of the village chief can only be said to be a piece of wood on a stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a wok on the sloping hearth, and a small flame was jumping in the gray embers. The village chief stared at them for a while, and drowsiness could not When the containment was swept up, he yawned, wrapped his robes and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is in a terrible silence, no one can detect that the village’s youngest daughter has stopped sobbing, her breathing has become lighter and Slow, the bruise on his face was slowly but firmly faded. In the next moment, she suddenly opened her eyes, the blue eyes were shining, the pupils were narrowed like a pinhole, in dim light they were Then the evil and the strangeness - the girl sat up silently, did not let the sound of the poor texture of the bed out of a star and a half, her movements were light and profitable, and there was no sign of injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked up to her father, quietly took off her clothes and let the linen robes fall to the ground, it was a healthy and Beautiful body. But very quickly, the shadow that fell on the wall began to distort - if the village chief was awake at this time and saw his daughter, he might be directly fainted and fainted. What kind of monster is this? The honey-colored rolls are screwed together like living creatures, like the soaked mud, which is then absorbed by her skull and shoulders. Her facial features gradually become blurred, the color of the skin, and the lips. The color of the eyes and the color of the eyes also dissipated. Her limbs became slender, her fingers had no nails, and there was no grain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hangs her head deeply, staring at the head of the village, body, every detail until she feels satisfied - she changes again, body Stretched, widened, thickened, rough fingers, strong arms, broad shoulders, thick neck, wide face and deep wrinkles, she, no, or it has become another "village ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village chief was caught in the neck, he thought it was a nightmare, yeah, maybe a nightmare, a real nightmare, because he saw himself sitting on his body, with a sneer, stuck in him The neck, he frantically resisted, kicking his legs, but this is him, how can he fight against himself - he tried his best to break free from the rim-like hands, but backfired, he Even a little voice didn't come out. He wanted to see how his little daughter was, but his eyes were covered with a bloody red mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to die, so when he hears a soft, low voice and says that he can’t understand, he thinks he has reached the mourning wasteland, Listen to the will of the waiter of the god of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that voice is not about death, but life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps:鞠躬Thanks to the students who don’t repeat the vote to cast a valuable monthly ticket! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;鞠躬 Thanks to ka1thas for casting a valuable monthly pass! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silk of Death rewards the Nine Fish 1oo starting point.
