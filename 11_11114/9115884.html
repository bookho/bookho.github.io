The pre-planted apple grows into a tree and has a lot of fruit. He picks a part and stores it with cherries, plums, and blackberries. Some of them are fermented into wine," he raised a crystal bottle and shook the bottle. The blue-violet clear liquid is as beautiful as the sky at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My King..." Perant said with a slap in the face that his injury has been better than half, but it still takes a long time to rest, and compared to Yingge Wei, he can say without hesitation, he is more willing to go with Ruiwen, and their little daughter, Ximari. Even though it is the elf, the darling of Angris, the current West Marie is only holding his fist and sleeping for a long time, but in such a scene, Perant can not be bored if he can continue to watch for a hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When only two of us are there," Ingway said: "Don't be so serious, Perant - I am inviting my friends to try new wines." It’s not about negotiating or launching a war.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perant had to take a cup of mixed fruit from his hand, the name of the wine was lame, but the taste Very good, it can be compared with some mellow red wines, and there is also the smell of nuts. It may be that Berlin has made barrels of oak or walnut. "Ingeway..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry is back "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Ingway said. "He came to visit me, even though I was still asleep at the time."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His situation..." Perant turned the cup and looked for the right words: "It doesn't seem so good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What's more!" said the king of the jungle: "He looks like a puppy that was abandoned in the swamp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ge Wei!” Perant added a tone. He never doubted that Ingwi would not love Kerry, even if he loves West Marie, he can’t say more than Ingewell’s love Kerry, you know, Kerry’s mother, Ingway’s wife, returned to Angris’s knees thousands of years before the catastrophe of thousands of years. For more than a thousand years, the role of father and mother was not the other’s king of the jungle. No matter how busy the official business, the Singer elves I can see their king and his only heir to spend the best time of the day together, maybe dawn, maybe dusk, or maybe a warm noon, and Ingway even gave it a name called Xiaokai. Dedicated time period, also noted and painted on the memo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This memo is still in Perant, because there is Kerry's childhood graffiti on it - yes, under the serious and intense meeting record, there are Xiaokai's childish notes and drawings to record when he is with his father. A bird, a leaf, or a piece of honey, any good things will be remembered by Xiao Kai seriously, and many of them are written under the instigation of the king of the jungle. Love ada (the elves call their father)" and the words that make the adult Kerry Ben feel very embarrassed - Kerry will hide them, no one will give them, so the king of the jungle Transfer them to Perant’s tree house so that if he wants to see it, he can use his excuse to negotiate with the state and hold himself in the room, sitting in a rocking chair and slowly reading and recalling the delicious honey. . Dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this sweet memory is only a hundred and fifty years old. Ingewell is the king of the well-deserved jungle, and the existence of this name has a necessary condition, that is, his reason must be greater than sensibility, and in a straightforward way, it is cruelty and self-control. These two qualities are hardly appearing in the elves who are free, and Engel is not an exception, and Perant is watching how he can cast himself into a little bit... Wang's - with blood, With pain, with the lives of enemies and tribes - no one knows how many sufferings and sufferings the Singer elves have encountered on their way to the silver-crowned jungle, and no one knows how much the Ingwi King of the jungle lost and how much . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Kerry’s adulthood, he is no longer the king of the jungle, but a soldier and a citizen, who no longer lives in his father’s In the palace, they live in the tree house or the fortress like other elves. Like them, they have to perform tasks, hunting, cleaning themselves and the room. In this long process, Ingwi has not seen him. Keruiben was not allowed to enter the court, and many elves thought he was too strict, but Ingeway never changed his approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there still a very young Kyrie Ben crying, maybe, but even if I accidentally broke my longbow, maybe I was bitten by a squirrel With his fingers, or falling into the frozen Star River, he can also maintain a warm, sly smile like the sun - just a bit bitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Perant woke up, Kerry had returned to the royal court as a real warrior and continued to live in the room next to the King of the Jungle, but His cottages on the edge of the gray ridge and the silver-crowned jungle were still preserved. He used to clean and stay for a few days. Later, Kerry Ben began to travel across the continent, sometimes for a few years or more, perhaps a little revenge for the youngest - so it was the turn of Ingway to miss his children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druids have also worried about this, but as far as Kerry is concerned, Ingway’s teaching cannot say failure, but it is too harsh, just like now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kremar did not return," Perant said. "But he is not dead, nor is he staying elsewhere - I mean, he Will it never return to the Grey Ridge or the jungle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The little black guy has only half the blood of the elf," Ingway Gentlely said: "He will leave us after all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But not now, not in this way," Perant stared at the king of the jungle. "Kerry has never been so depressed. Is Cruymar betrayed him, or is there another accident?" He threatened his toast: "Don't tell me you have expected this."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I swear no," said the king of the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So..." Perant’s words were interrupted in half, and Berlin was squatting about thirty feet away from them, apparently critical. Things have to be reported. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of the jungle, Ingwe, raised his hand and Berlin went forward and bowed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say," the king of the jungle handed over a glass of honey to Berlin: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Kerry wants me to open Wan Welin." Berlin held a wooden cup, shortly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does he want to know?" Ingway said, "But it doesn't matter, open it, open Wan Weilin, tell Kerry this if he looks for If you can't answer, you can ask me, or he finds it, and I wait for him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolin seems to want to say something, but still hold back He once again bowed to the king of the jungle and Perant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of the jungle turned to meet the old friend’s blaming eyes: “Only this time,” Ingway promised: “This time only.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know that forcing to stay awake has a great damage to your body," Perant said, but he also took the king of the jungle, but he thought Forcing Ingewell to rest well and beat him: "Okay," Druid said sullenly. "If you don't want to discuss this, then let's discuss another thing. Kerry wants to learn from Wanwei." What does Lin get?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such an instant, Perant really wants to beat his king and old friends, "related to Kreima?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said the King of the jungle. Dudu3();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is Kremar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————— ———————————————————————————————————————————<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of Grenada has been in a state of repression and uneasiness recently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody knows why the red dragon and the dragon’s mother, Greed, suddenly angered, no one knows, they only saw huge bodies The red dragon took off from the "Death of Death" and flew into the sky, then swooped down and poured a flame into a place where a group of goblins gathered. They raised livestock for the people in the kingdom, but after the flame of the red dragon, there was only The rest of the hot scorched earth - Greed's anger did not calm down, her dragon children flew out of the nest, and her pastors quickly came out of the temple and the sanctuary, demanding more sacrifices Goods and human beings - every non-Grenada person is inevitably subject to cross-examination and extortion. Even a strong mages and the richest merchants can't escape the rude treatment of soldiers in black armor. Some of them are fortunate, not because they can find dragons who can help them speak and guarantee (the more people who understand the situation at this critical moment, the more they don’t dare to act rashly), but because they still have a little bit next to others Alternative use, they were taken away after all the gold and goods can at least get a free person, and for those less fortunate, the lack of priests is not a positive ritual sacrifice it first needed to Grenada? Although there is no shortage of slaves in the black market of Grenada, this kind of sacrifice does not need to pay even a copper coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are people who can live in hotels and houses, like those who wander around the streets of Grenada, like thieves, assassins, or Travelers, as well as glamorous monks, they will avoid the black armor and red robes in their usual time, but today they will be arrested mercilessly, no matter what they say or do, and some others Was killed on the spot - a traveler was pierced by a soldier's short sword while his hands were wrapped in a purse, and a thief wanted to use his superior skills to hide into the shadows and escape when he was rescued by a warlock. The devil caught it, the soldiers dragged him behind the horse and died. Their prey even included a mage. His speed and accuracy of casting can be a mentor elsewhere, but he is in Greiner. Da, after being defeated by two rude soldiers, he was besieged by three warlocks. Finally, his soul was drawn from the festering body and stuffed into a gemstone with a poor texture, waiting to become a warlock and the devil. Or lack of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, such "cleaning" actions are not uncommon in Grenada, so after the initial chaos, the streets and the market are frozen as quickly as they are frozen, but they all become empty, fear Or bloodthirsty eyes are hidden in the house, and through the reserved peepholes and gaps, the soldiers and the warlocks walked through the streets, leaving blood and dead bodies, and those who ate the bodies. The little monster whispered to the back, and occasionally a soldier turned back and hacked one or two little monsters. It doesn't matter, as long as he remembers to compensate the temple or the warlock tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greedy’s anger is for a reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will be happy to eat a meal, and when he is comfortable and snoring, he suddenly jumps out of the air and jumps out of a stupid Kaussian "ambassador". And still screaming constantly: "Idiot! She ran, idiot, she ran!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe others don’t know that the sharp-nosed guy is yelling What, but Greed is absolutely not to know, she clawed the "ambassador", opened the half-plane and found only the empty abyss monster like a slave belly, and Fro only Leaving a broken body, the most quintessential part has long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ———————————————— Completely added after half an hour. ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— ————————————————(To be continued.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
