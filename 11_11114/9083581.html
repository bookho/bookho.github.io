His mother was not a Norman in the Highlands, and his father was in a remote place. The ridiculous bottom of the valley met her. He was deeply confused by her. Regardless of the opposition of the king and relatives, she insisted on marrying her. No one knows how he persuaded them. Fukai’s father’s congregation only Knowing that their lord had a wife overnight, a beautiful and rich wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unlike other aristocratic women, she is like a sleeping dragon, always entrenched in her castle, never inviting others Never accepting the invitation of others, even the beggars of the aristocrats and knights were ignored. Later, people knew that she had a huge chamber of commerce, and her curiosity gradually faded. After ten years, people again Starting to whisper - because of her unchanging beauty, they suspected that she had obtained some unknown "help" from the well-connected caster, but the day after Fukai's father died, she also Dead, all the secrets sink into the depths of the earth with the fallen sand - although there are still people who occasionally mention her, but almost all because of the giant chamber of commerce still walking on the mainland, this chamber is her dowry She handed the chamber of commerce to her son Fu Kai, and Fu Kai gave the guild to his illegitimate child, Dylan Don Clay, after becoming the finance minister of Norman Norman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chamber of commerce is like a huge monster, except for warriors and mercenaries, as well as casters who can envy the king of a country. Holding strong force to sway in this dangerous plane, no thief guild dared to rob or blackmail them, nor did the lord dare to bring his knight on their path, the king and Dagong had to sign The next time the monopoly warrants, even the orcs will retreat to their team, which makes them gather like a wet dough that rolls in breadcrumbs. Rapidly grow and swell up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Fukai knows that a large part of the gold that the Chamber of Commerce has gathered is unknown, and the rest can only maintain the normal operation of the Chamber of Commerce. This started from his acceptance of the Chamber of Commerce - where did they go? On the night he blamed the head of the chamber of commerce, he thought that the mother who had been sleeping with her father had appeared in his room just like today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fukai’s mother is not as good as people, but she is a strange person who is indifferent to personality and sociable. In fact, when Fukai was still very young, he discovered that the mother was almost never in her own room. She would only appear when she felt that she needed to appear, just like this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold fingers squeezed his face, very soft and soft relatives, just like each mother kneaded his child’s face, just... Disappointing me, Fu Kai. I thought you would have at least a little change, but I have to say that you are still the most vulnerable and incompetent of my children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Fukai thought that he was no longer the child who would be deeply hurt by his mother’s words, but his slightly shuddering body still sold him – he could say that he did his best to control himself. Will cry desperately and in vain to confirm the mother's words: "But also the most loyal one." His voice trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman shook her head gently. "In my opinion, from no loyalty and betrayal," she said: "Only useless and useful." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will complete every thing you need me to do, mother." Fukai said in a hurry: "Whether it is before or now, or in the future." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hope so," she said, "but you have a soft heart. It makes me worry."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fu Kai only felt a sharp pain, he looked down, his chest was cut open by an invisible claw, blood stained his silk satin jacket. The tights, the skin and muscles stretched like flowers on both sides, and the ribs opened like a long, white pistil, stabbed into the air, and the slender, white hand reached into the chest and grabbed the hot heart. Even if it was taken out, it was still beating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What a human heart," the woman muttered. "So weak, so humble, yet so...interesting." She stuffed her heart back behind the ribs, like a pull-on placket, pulling the flesh and pulling it, and watched them slowly heal slowly, like this injury, if placed on her other children, maybe I haven't waited for her to change her heart back because she has recovered. To be more precise, their body will not be so soft--the bottomless abyss is down. She didn't think that the human male could actually make her pregnant, since her life. When ancient to a certain extent, it is like a certain law, only the strongest male dragon can make her breed, and other people, even the descendants of the most dragon blood, can not do it, but it is such a weak The human male can also make himself a father of a dragon blood. She was born out of curiosity and was born of Fu Kai. Unfortunately, maybe the law reminds her of her head, and the child is born and disabled. Although he has the most noble and noble blood, he has left only a negligible shadow like the moonlight passing over the water. Even his son Dylan Don Clay is better than him, even though The outstanding is human, not the dragon's - her blood has not been able to continue to pass on, which is also regarded as one of Fu Kai's most intolerable shortcomings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is my descendants still in Fort Rebecca?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Fukai said, he was chilly and felt weak, but he knew if now He dared to fall, and his mother would let him sleep forever: "He doesn't want to leave Thunderbolt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't let him and a man care about it, "Fukai's mother said: "It's not worth it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need me to recall him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "For the time being, let him stay there." She said: "I have prepared a small gift for him, I think he will like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————————————————— ———————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Today you Still want a person to fall asleep? Lord?" A Fro priest greeted Mei She is still very young, fresh and fresh like a berry that has just been picked from the branches. It is one of the most popular among the Fro temples on the island, and it is because of this that she is not only somewhat delicate but also ambitious. Vibrant, especially before she gave her more gold and gems than Mei Mei before the next full moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Mei Mi said impatiently, she broke free from Gülen’s arm just a moment ago, and the thief’s body is more than other men. It is soft and cold, but it is as hot as fire. Especially this time, the tiredness that has never been done has taken up all her body and mind. She doesn’t want to say something boring with a stupid little wild cat. Does she think that she is the director? The position of the pastor is to see who is more devout to Fro? Don't be kidding, even on the mainland, the chief pastor in the temple is not necessarily the one that is most loved. She only needs to be loved by the most powerful and powerful man in the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For months, you, you seem to be with the thief all the time." The young priest stared at one of the necks hanging on Plum. Tourmaline, which is simply tied up by a string and suspended between the soft chest of plum, but without the gold and silver setting, it does not detract from its preciousness and beauty. "It does not seem to conform to Fro's intention," she said boldly: “I have not seen other men entering your room. Who are you guarding for?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
