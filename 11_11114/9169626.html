			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Knights heard the sound of the collapse of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longshan State invites dwarves to participate in the construction of the wall can allow 12 knights to stand side by side, it is wide enough to become a battlefield, Longshan State People and Grenada's dragon claw knights formed a state of glue. Simply for soldiers and knights, the guards can't compare with the offensive side. Longshan's soldiers and most knights are just mortals, but Grenada's dragon-claw knights almost all have red dragons or demons and demons. The blood, although very shallow, is like the fact that Kreima once inadvertently showed in the Bibi Dyke, their strength is far more than the former, and their mounts are not horses, but have teeth You need to look up to get a glimpse of the whole face of the Devil. The first time someone facing this kind of monster can be praised as a brave person, as long as it is not scared, and the feet are soft, not to mention fighting with the semi-magic or dragons who control this monster. A considerable number of soldiers are not even their enemies, and they are pierced by the spears, and the screams of the beards of the Deinonychus are desperate for others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only paladins of Tyre and Rosada, or the priests of Ilmot, who can resist these non-people, sing loudly The name of the following gods, fighting the orcs, giants and dragon-claw knights, their weapons flashed with the light of the magic, so that these world steels are as hard and flexible as gold, they can crush the fear The dragon's scales can also protect the dragon-claw knights. The evil bloods are dying under their hammers and wide swords. Their presence makes the monsters and the Greinada people involuntarily cringe or dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where people don’t have nothing to do, they can’t suddenly have the power of bears or the lions and tigers, but they also have dwarf weapons and Organs, on such a wide wall, they rely on the corners of the bumps to fight the towers. Every corner or turning point can be a tiny fortress they hold. In addition to the arrows, they also have rolling stones, hot oil and Lime, under the seemingly flat ground, often has a slender well that can extend from the top of the wall to the ground or a trap filled with spikes, even the simplest one or many pieces. Stone bricks that suddenly rise above the normal weight of humans can also cause an orc or giant to stun and rise, and they may never climb again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the casters, Longshan State accepts neutral warlocks, mages and pastors, of course, if you are a good and noble person, then better. There are also people in Longshan who have never had a warlock, but among them, the children with the talent of the mage and the pastor are more than most of the countries. Their parliament and the consuls never devote this investment in the Longshan state. As long as you have the talent of the caster, you will not stop in front of the magic gate because of lack of teaching and money. As long as you don't lie on this key issue, the city councillors will handle all of them for you. Things, you don't have to worry about the future life of your parents, brothers and sisters, and you don't have to worry about finding a mentor who is willing to accept yourself, not to be stunned by expensive casting materials, blank scrolls, gem ink, all from the city-state. Responsible for spending, if you can become a strong caster of Alva like Bituminburg, not only the city-state you were born in, but also every city-state in Longshan For your backing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gradually increases the number of casters in Longshan City State to a point that is equally astounding, but these casters are compared to the Warlocks of Grenada. For the Master, they have a great weakness, that is, not cruel and mean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they know that they can’t go backwards, they are behind their parents, their wives and children, as well as companions and friends, fat warlocks have seen more than once To a caster suddenly flashes a clear sky--there is a spell in the list of spells that allows a caster to deal 10 damage equal to his maximum cap, but this spell can destroy them. In addition to the enemy, the wizard at the center of the spell's outbreak will also take all the damage, no need to speculate, and no need to cast a spell. The fat warlock also knows that after the ray of the spell is extinguished, the wizard he knows or does not know may even have a hair. It may not be able to stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just above him, the dazzling light once again occupied the people’s vision, an eagle lion body beast screamed and fell, it was lucky There is a breath of reluctance, but the knights and warlocks on it have become fly ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only thirty feet, the fat warlock said to himself, he used his teeth to bite the runes, the magic stirred the air of the week, a vicious spell so did not It can take effect, but the short spear that comes with it cuts off the skin on his waist, and only nails him to the wall. The fat warlock can hear the eagle lion body beating, the sound is weak. It became loud, and the wind wiped his cheeks. This was another precursor to the dive. He grabbed a bottle of potion, but one hand reached out from the back and took the bottle away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat warlock slammed his eyes shut, and a fierce wind suddenly pushed his body away. When he could open his eyes, he saw only a huge golden eagle entangled with an eagle lion. Fighting, in this battle of winged creatures, the knight on the lion's lion body can hardly play his role, even the warlock's gestures are interrupted relentlessly, anyway, one The druid's wisdom is not inferior to a beast. He won't even interrupt the warlock when he just raised his hands or sang the first syllable, and he won't risk waiting until the last moment. Every time in the middle, not a collision, a bite, or a wing with a wind that wraps around the messy feathers, the warlock screams angrily, but the eagle lion has been mad because of repeated provocations, the knight Maybe you can control it, but maybe not now - and, just as the fat warlock sneaked under the arms of the earth creatures like a bug in the shadow, he saw that the golden eagle clawed tight Tightly gripped the tail of the lion's lion The latter was dragged and dropped by the former, until a faint light flashed on the back of the lion's beast - the place where they were suddenly lost most of the gravity, the golden eagle was thrown high and unguarded, the warlock's The spell hit him, but the dangerous little bottle fell off, just between the knight and the warlock, and then, yes, as the fat warlock wanted to see, a bloody splash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two dragon knights noticed here, they drove their eagle lions to fly here, and the fat warlocks hid in the shadows. They passed away not far, did not find him, did not find the druid, only the fat warlock who always looked at him knew that the druid of the incarnation of the golden vulture was expelled by the blast and the spell of the warlock was released. Immediately landed on the ground, and then the fat warlock could not find him, but he may have become a mole, or a rabbit, anyway, that is the kind of guy who will make holes. The fat warlock paused, wondering if he would sneak into the corpse of the earth creature, but then he opened the stupid idea - certainly not, the druid obviously knew that he was going to finish the job. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several casters who have been dispatched. The fat warlock does not know if he is the only one to arrive here, but he immediately heard a gloomy roar. It’s like coming from a long distance, but he knows that it’s by his side. The place where he lives is shaking violently. Stones and dirt fall from the sky. He hears that the Grinada people use them. The language cursed and screamed, "I can't be too late." He said to himself that the spell that had previously fixed him on the body of the earth element was about to expire. The fat warlock took out the rune on his body and he got it for the first time. Such a beautiful rune plate, pure Mithril, the gemstone inlaid on it is perfect even if it is worn by a king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His finger is placed in the center of the rune plate, there is a very fragile emerald, as soon as it moves, it will break, and then the magic in the rune Will spew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! Please stop immediately," a strange voice suddenly said. "Sorcerer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat warlock suddenly looked up and he saw a stupid guy who was obviously bigger than the other lions and lions, its The chest and the abdomen are wrapped in the chain of Mithril, and the knight on it looks like a lord or a high-ranking lord. The appearance is even justifiable, and it looks like it is not evil. It seems to be believed in Tyre. Or the Paladin of Rosada, but the fat warlock knows that he is a Grinada, or a bloody dragon, his hair color and twilight are proof that it is no longer conclusive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know what you are holding?" Mitt said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A rune plate." The fat warlock said honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A thing that can kill you a thousand times." Mitt said, "The people didn't tell you? Of course, this is what it should be." Otherwise, you won't take it in your hand and bring it to this place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand very well, adult," fat warlock screams Hudi smiled. "Is there any problem? I mean, except yours?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They didn't tell you," Mitt said: "The magic contained in this rune will be swallowed up if you are motivated, before you can react." There was a pity in his eyes: "They want to ruin our path, but at the same time, they also There is no chance for you to be even a tiny one, you will die here, under countless rocks and mud, like a mortal. No one knows that you are here, you did this, maybe Some people think that you have escaped," he shook his head. "They may not even converge on your bones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat warlock opened his mouth in surprise: "Really?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
