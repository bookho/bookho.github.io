WwW.XshuOTXt.CoM"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The casters occasionally visit each other without being hostile. Sometimes they are exchanging spellcasting materials, scrolls or rune coats are not good at each other; the relationship is more intimate, and the same casters in the camp are still They will live together for a short period of time, exchange academics, discuss tips and seek enlightenment, and there is an Alvara Master like the Betty Fortress and the Antonio Master of the White Tower. They are the chief mage of a city or fortress, in the parliament. Occupy a very important place, if the outside spellcaster does not want to pay attention and vigilance, in general, they will go to see the only level of the caster before entering the area and the second or third day of the fortress. Being allowed to do their disciples for work - otherwise The latter will be treated as the Master or his territory has been "up to no good", will not only be monitored Guard, custody, control may even be forcibly evicted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But note that the time and place of the visit also need to be cautious, the location must be determined by the interviewee, the time is also, but the visitor will not take time It is specified that in the evening to early morning, visitors will not ask for this, because from the evening, the casters may lose most of their spells because of work or accident, and late night is used by ordinary humans and most casters. The time to meditate and rest, the early morning is the best moment for them to remember spells - above, they are also the most vulnerable period of time. It is better to go to "visit" at this time than to say that it is not good to say that it is a kind of Blatant provocations - even the best-tempered casters will ruthlessly cast their most aggressive and powerful offensive spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It needs to be explained that the relationship between the Master of the Lord and Kremar is somewhat embarrassing. Although he belongs to the lord of the East Crown, the lord can Not only is he a mage, but for the purpose of checks and balances, the lord gave these mage almost equal rights and prestige – and he was sent by the lord to meet them, because Kremar was the seventh of the lord. The son of Beavis. The Master has never been clear about this. Given the noble status and status of the caster, no matter which region or country has established the inheritance law, it is clearly stated that the disciple's disciple has the right to inherit his inheritance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Beavis has been confirmed dead. Then his island is logical and will be inherited by Krimall - of course, for him, his rights are heretofore, but if he can have this identity in the future. Then the master of the lord must take the lead in saluting him, because the young wizard of the black hair not only has the talent of the caster but also the power of the common custom. The two add up, but the former does not show humility to him, although this is not his intention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially he thought of the side island he had explored and traveled, that is, the island that Beavis had the privilege to obtain, it was only a few miles away from the East Cove Island. Far away, the shape is like a slender leaf, but whether it is territory or property in the island of the East Crown lord only on the main island, the Master is not at all wonder why the lord of the East Crown will seal the side island to them. The law is called the rebellious Beavis. Because Beavis is a naive idiot, and because his loved one was a slave on the island, he will give up his inherent power and status and relocate to a distant white tower, so that the old lord can take it easy. From the mouth of the son he has grown up to threaten his throne and fortress, the most fertile meat is taken from the mouth of the throne. The mages are the cronies of the lord. How many silks, gold, weapons and slaves can be exchanged for the annual production of the island? People are more aware than him. He is not sure whether the old lord will give the younger mages to the side of the island, but as long as he thinks about it, his heart will feel pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he doesn't want others to know about it. He didn't bother to tell the ninth son of the lord why he didn't visit the black hair caster at this moment. Although the guy played some small tricks, he took his proper position from his twin brother, and it was very Clever, but the other sons of the lords are not stupid people. And he has a richer and wider territory than him. He doesn't think this little snake can be the last winner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the ninth son of the East Crown lord does have a very keen sense of smell. His island is not the closest to Red Throat, but his movements are better than Anyone must come quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei lazily got up from the bed, her long hair was completely sweaty The ground was soaked, and it was spread wet on her light golden back. At the end of the roll, as her pace swayed, sweeping back and forth across the rounded buttocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sniffed in the air and tentatively pushed a dark brown wooden door that was narrower than the other doors. The height between the squat and the knee is engraved with a beautiful pattern. The priest of Fro opened it with a single push. After the door, as Meimi expected, it was a spacious and dimly lit bathroom - a flame-like gold-red fluorine. The stone will cast light like the setting sun to every part of the room, covered with fluorite and thin gauze to make them smash; below the ground, the square bath can accommodate four or five people at the same time bathing in the bath, the bath side The indescribably fascinating rules of shells, corals, crystals and silver carved and created neck pots, plates and round belly bottles, which contain rose petals and sea salt, and those crystal bottles and silver pots should contain essential oils. With perfume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plum honey walked around the bath and the bath was dry. If she didn't see what they had seen before, she would be very willing to use the dispatch to serve their slaves, but neither she nor Gülen had already had an appetite for the Dragon Fire Island. They didn't want to see any slaves, even if they didn't even want to see any slaves. They are indeed some of the coveted wonderful people - the boys at the feet of plum honey are those with honey and light brown skin. Their faces are tender, but their bodies are long, their limbs are strong, and they are gentle. Rather than human beings with thoughts and souls—their eyes seem clean and bright, but they are so lifeless, even less powerful than the magical images that Mei Mi had seen in a certain temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro's pastor drove them out mercilessly, and she thought she would be pleaded and entangled - after all, as a follower of Fro, she It is also often forced to fill any dangerous tool. It is not surprising that these slaves will be punished for not being able to please her – but no, they obey every order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she was uncertain, a pale, slender hand came out behind her, he might just press it somewhere Then the warm water spewed out of the gap that was quietly opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water flow is not clear. More correctly, there are a lot of bubbles and tiny impurities, and there is a strange smell: "Sulphur?" Mei Mi asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German nodded and he jumped into the bath. When the hands didn't know and touched the place, the sound of the water suddenly increased, and the dense fog suddenly blocked between the two: "It is a hot spring," the thief said at the other side of the fog, his voice was low and slow. With a share of as long as a man can hear the feeling of lameness, "The reason why Longhuo Island is called Longhuo Islands..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Because it is shaped like a flame that a dragon spurts out.” Mei Mi said that while she couldn’t wait to slide into the hot water, it’s true that the Dragon Fire Island is a group of archipelago arranged in an arc shape, overlooking the sky. You will find it is like a broken shuttle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can only be said to be part of the reason," said Gülen, who reached out and touched a silky body less unexpectedly: "The most important thing is Under the archipelago, there is more energy than the flame of the dragon. They emit white light, burning around the clock, turning the stone into water, melting steel and gold, and turning the air into coke. The scorching heat, at the same time, also transpires the groundwater passing through their sides - when the water rushes out of the ground, it can burn a person to a few bones in a flash."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds terrible." Mei Mi said, she leaned against Gülen. He rubbed his neck with a clear scallop on it, and she laughed happily. They just had some... crazy: "It’s like sitting on the back of a dragon."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's right." Gülen said: "The danger is extremely good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you will still stay "Here, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For a while." Gülen said that he needs to strengthen his strength, skill in his skills, and accumulate considerable wealth. This way he can return to the port of Point. Back in Azores, a competent thief always has better memory than others, and the enemies in memory will torment him in a long nightmare. The only way to solve it is to use his dagger to pierce them. The heart or throat, he will relive the wonderful moments again and again every night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You," the thief asked, "Did you decide to stay in the Longhuo Islands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I know that I am a spike, but I don't want to pull myself out. Of course, if they are willing to leave it is their own business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Are you sure you won't keep up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Plum said simply: "That will only make me stupid and pitiful." Gülen, I don't want to make myself like that... Yes, as you said," she grabbed the thief's back gently. "But you are really a mixed ball. Is it? When I am still stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know that I have no fun at the time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief said, and then made a small scream, because Mei Mei bit him, on the other side of the original tooth mark, now the two sides can be considered symmetrical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not very good." Gülen said: "It is said that someone who has left a tooth mark on someone else will die to that person."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei made a rude gesture to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think I will get used to it." Fro's pastor said that the hot spring made her cheeks and lips blushing and her eyes shining. "Perhaps, except The slaves - the law of the Dragon Islands are too strange, there are slaves elsewhere, but no matter where they are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am surprised that these slaves are as smooth as the appliances," the thief said. "You know, even if the sheep will bark before being killed, the cows will shed tears, and they will simply be with a piece of wood." The cups are generally the same. You beat them, assassinated them, shred them, and they won't even escape and escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mei thought, according to the eunuch As she said, she clapped her hands and a slave came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan picked up one eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Study dog ​​barking." Mei Mi said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the slave carefully learned the dog barking, and to be honest he did not learn much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One foot jump."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately mentioned a foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go forward." Mei Mi said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jumped forward and jumped to the end of the room, facing the wall, the hard alabaster wall, his head bumping into the wall, Ge Lan stared at his eyes, but the thieves could not find anything - a trace of the shrinking and hesitation that ordinary people should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This may be the most unbearable place on the Long Fire Island," he paused, reluctantly adding: "One."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ninth son of the East Crown lord called his gnomes the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul from another plane is the first to see a gnome - as a human dwarf, they look a bit like a magical giant The little ones in the work are almost as high as the human waist, but the proportions of the face and the limbs, as well as the body are very harmonious, the male does not have a beard, the skin is white and smooth like a woman, no wrinkles, the teeth are neat, the hair is combed In the scorpion, the male hangs behind and the female is in the back of the head. No matter what gender, it is thick with lead, black eyeliner, and a little red rouge on the lips. It is difficult to identify the elderly from the appearance. And young people; perhaps out of inclination or hobbies, each gnome is wearing luxury - a gold ring with a large gemstone in his fingers on his finger, a banded bracelet on his wrist, and a silk robe There are layers of embroidered on the robes, and the tips of the boots are dotted with sea pearls. When they came over, they were full of rich aromas. Birdwin couldn’t help but sneezed several times and exchanged them. Several white eyes<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
