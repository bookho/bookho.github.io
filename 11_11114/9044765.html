			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;radish? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beet, the Lich says, you don't have to be more ignorant than a goblin, and it seems to me that you are stupid enough to go to heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks just like carrots, the soul of the outside world is snarling in the heart, the same fluffy green leaves, the same round and large purple-red tubers From the outside, you can almost imagine the crisp and spicy taste, but as long as they are cut, the deep red and white stripes in the tree rings are vividly indicating the two crops. different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the beet land is very similar to the radish. This is an undisputed fact, and it is another radish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves don’t deliberately “plant” crops, they only remember where there is a sweetest and most juicy raspberry rose, or where there is one The blackcurrant can always produce the most dense fruit. Although they brew honey from the eucalyptus sap, they never intentionally transplant the eucalyptus seedlings to places where they should not grow. The big trees are dumped, they will only wait quietly for the grass moss and the new saplings to fill the space left by it; the souls of the outside world only saw the serfs of the serfs outside the Thunder, they are there and Bird. Wen catches the wild boar together. To be honest, the land is hardly said to be carefully managed. At least for Kremar, the chaotic field that has been invaded by the wild boar is not much different from the rest. The branches crawl between the thorns and the rocks. There are no ridges and no soil, and there are no drains, but these can be seen on the side islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s because the new owner of the side island came to investigate, the beets have been cleaned, the dark green branches are The cloth on the waist of the hoe is still neat and tidy. The hoes clean the beetroots in the clear water, cut them to the new owner, and each section has the size of the baby's face. The texture is clear, and the blood of the elves can make Cremari clearly smell the sweetness of the beet. Not only the tubers, but also the honey juice in the leaves, the elf Kerry has no intention of leaning down, mentioning half, using his "starlight" to cut thin slices to eat, the outside world The soul immediately swept past, and it was separated from Kerry Ben, and the beets were eaten directly. Especially the sugar beet used for sugar extraction was not good, and the juice was full of earthworms. The palate is also slightly rough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soaking in the water for a while will not be so heavy, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world expresses horror how do you know this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have eaten all the things I can eat for a while, and the undead who used to say it is calm,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The soul of the outer world frowned at the troubles, the identity of the cohabitation has been plaguing him, because the other side has used the palace to describe the residence of the father, several times, in this plane, the word palace is not everyone Can be used, but the same. He can also learn from the only words that the original owner of the body has fallen to the point where he is not even as good as he is, although he has mentioned that his father’s servant took care of him until he was fourteen, but if he was taken care of People who are hungry to get into the corner of the courtyard to pick wild berries can be considered a kind of care, then the word may be read as care but written abuse or surveillance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some humans may be ashamed to mention the despicable and weak past. But once the undead did not care, the reason why he would keep most people secret is to ensure that his true identity is not leaked, and this is obviously more suitable to put on a white robe instead of a black robe, public opinion red robe and The foreigner of the gray robe has a soft heart. The Lich has already discovered that he has always been tolerant of people, but for the weak he will always retreat to his heel to hit the bottom line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your slave should know this too. But they probably didn't expect their new owner to be like this... Well, the bark reminded me that it was good, just say a number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the whip they want to lick, not less than ten times, otherwise they may be scared to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world tried it and found that he couldn’t say it, then he turned to Kerry, "?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is looking down on the "Taro", the sun is burning their bare back, the whip on the back is like a crack in the bark, their faces are close to the ground, the ranger can't see Their look at the moment, but the fear of death violently impacted the sharp perception of the elf as the tide before the storm, he knew that he had inadvertently made a mistake, causing these "gimmicks" to be dirty, untreated food. Dedicated to the guests of their owners and masters, although their intention is to let the new owners see how sweet and attractive the beets they grow, but in any case, the master and the guests will not make mistakes, then the mistakes are Only slaves, and this crime comes to them, they may be downgraded to "hands" or "cows." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Dada said in his heart that these "gimmicks" would only be hanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue," the soul of the alien world suddenly said, "Today's journey begins." He said casually: "As for their fault, I There is a companion, he is very good at giving and disciplining, I think I can give this job to him to complete, Ge Lan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, The thief immediately said: "My means are that these idiots can't imagine, I am very happy to work for you, adults," the thief's eagle eyes stared at Dada: "This is my honor."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They belong to you." Dada said, bending down deeply. Prior to this, Kerry had seen Kreima blinking at Gülen, so the elf hid his smile behind the beetroot, he could almost Make sure that the next thief will be very, very busy, so that there is no time to punish a few "gimmicks", and Krimall said that he is a guest rather than a mercenary or servant, as an eunuch, Dada is No right to blame or order him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;狡猾Glan may put this opportunity on hold until they leave or longer in this team, Baldwin is a friend of Kerry Ben, Leo Na is a lover of Birdwin, and Mei Mi is obsessed with Baldwin. Although Gülen is excellent in skills and sensitive, but because of his profession and origin, he is not jealous of the Elf Ranger and Bird. They may not despise or hate. Gülen, anyway, they walked all the way to this, but to say that they trusted him, I am afraid that it will wait a long time, so the thief did not hesitate to choose the Master, although this Master is also the main cause of his exile. But Kreima unexpectedly got along well with him. Kerry thought, probably because of the good relationship of Kremar, few people would not like him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the owner said so, Dada could not be more embarrassed, not to mention that Gülen also warned him, so their trip was determined not to make any minor changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s worth mentioning that compared to the island they once saw, the ninth son’s territory is like an island without a foot lizard, the shape of the side island Similar to a humpback whale that rises above the surface, the broad and fat head is towering in the north, and the tail fins are hidden in the warm waters of the south. The fortresses of the lords of the past are in the water hole of the whales. The center is located on a huge rock surrounded by abundant fresh water. It is connected to the outside world with a delicate suspension bridge. According to Dada, the lake that may connect the water element plane is nearly three thousand feet above sea level. The rock where the fortress is located is 4,500 feet above sea level. The slaves drilled the rock at the direction of the mage, built a ditch, and directed the cold and clean water to most of the side islands. They not only played an irrigation role, but also Let the land cool, lest the roots of the beets rot and deteriorate because of the high temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
