			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author’s words: Yesterday’s computer had some problems...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another chapter, in the code ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry was hit by the current. Www/xshuotxt/com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his two hundred years of travel, the Ranger has encountered evil warlocks and wizards more than once, or It is a misunderstanding that conflicts with the caster, and lightning and flame are the two natural elements most commonly used by the caster - he is no stranger to being hit by current, but it is also difficult to prevent with in a short time An attack that reduces damage, especially in the Pentium River - the current hits his right shoulder, where the moment is as hot as the iron of the iron, and then there is a strong numbness, his In the neck, the muscles on the right side of the arm began to twitch obviously, and the pain and numbness spread throughout the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His right hand is open, empty inside, the elf remembers holding the arm of Kremar before he broke into the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has tried to open his eyes, but only to see the darkness, the tiny debris in the rushing water flow rubbing and irritating his eyes, he I found myself being rolled up to a deeper and darker place - no reflection, sinking, not the depths of the Starlight River but the reefs or the cliffs on both sides of the Star River - this is why you look at the Starlight River Less than the drifter, the starry river's abundant water, disparity, and the flow rate of the horses make it easy to wrap up a huge rock like a house and a tree surrounded by several people. They are The violent currents are pushed again and again between the reefs and the river banks and riverbeds, but they are milled into small particles in a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the elves is superior and stronger than humans. Although sensitive to magic, magic often causes more damage to them than humans. Can give Kerry a little time, do not need a lot, that is, the starlight river over 500 feet or so, he can barely recover a little power, at least not so as to watch himself being thrown to the black rock. The only thing he can do is to lean over the body and avoid the irreparable damage to the head and important organs in the first impact, but he knows that this is just better than nothing. The roar of the Silver Falls one day ago made them need to be loud. Screaming can let others hear their words. The elf who was at the helm when the flying wing boat flew was able to see the blue-blue ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if he can escape the death god in the Starlight River, the pressure and blow of the Silver Falls will make all the previous struggles go to the east - Kerry does not feel that his body is more flexible and harder than Mithril Gold. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his first time from the end of life, Kerry is not afraid of death, nor is it greedy to survive, the greatest difference between elves and humans Maybe it is here. His heart lake is quiet. If there is any place to fall in love, it may be that he has not been able to return to the silver-crowned jungle. The elves often hold celebrations and banquets around the birth day of the god of life, Angris. They gather around the spring of life, play the sitar under the dense branches of the silver-crowned tree, sing and dance, and sip the pineapple and eucalyptus to make the light wine, which is as long as the sun. The silver-clad leaves are inserted in the hair to celebrate, and occasionally some fun games are played, such as archery, throwing a sieve or a small contest - this is the only king of the jungle after the death of his beloved wife. The glory that will show up for it. Because it is associated with faith rather than personal preference, it will make some elves who have lost their spouses and loved ones feel guilty, because the elves who love each other often choose to enter into a marriage contract at the celebration of Angris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves may only have one lover, one wife or husband, and even if one party dies, their image and voice will remain in the soul of the partner forever. Although they will reunite in the temple of Angris, before this, the tortures that have lasted for hundreds of years or even thousands of years will still cause the elves who have lost their spouses to fall into endless anxiety and embarrassment. Among them, if this happens, in general, they will transfer their duties and work to other people, and they will return to the dormant sleep in Wang Ting, deep in the jungle, and spend a long time treating themselves. Trauma - such sleep may last for several years, or ten years, and decades are no longer a minority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that the king of the jungle cannot choose this way to kill the intense pain in the heart. As the master of the silver-crowned jungle, his existence is like the most The sharp wide sword or the most solid shield is like a flag and a fortress. Behind him is the jungle and his people. There is no chance and possibility of slander and negligence - after Kerry's mother died, he often stayed up all night, not if he was in the "Wan Weilin" elf's three-dimensional library, looking through and looking up in his mind. Magic or record is to return to his study and continue to be white. It is never possible to finish the work, but sometimes he will be like a silver dragon, entrenched at the highest point of Wang Ting, listening to the wind like the sea waves when the north wind passes through the dense branches of the silver crown tree. Whistling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation continued until the young Kerry could run to the ground with bare feet, because if he could not find him in his father's bedroom, he would go to other places to find. I found out that if he felt tired, he would sleep directly in his father's large robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kerry is able to wear that large robes, the robes will still grow to let him step on the feet, and the communication between them will change. It became a conversation and drinking. The elves not only have the light wine formed by the mixture of pine branches and eucalyptus, but also the honey wine, the real honey wine, which is diluted with the pure snow honey and the water of the life spring. Spirits, transparent and thick, with subtle bubbles, will become as golden and translucent as the resin under the sun, sticky and smooth - if there is no important matter that cannot be entrusted, Kerry will return to silver in April and May. In the jungle, I don’t want to share the mead brewed by the King of the Jungle every night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe next year, the king of the jungle will sip a glass of honey alone, Kerry thought, he was seriously injured in the Battle of Thunder, but he did not Clear memory, he can't even remember how Kremar treated himself - but this time, death is close to him, and his mind is so clear, the first wave of pain caused by the impact came. At that time, he can clearly smell the cold and chilly wind - it is said that the wind is blowing on the plains of the mourning day and night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternal Angris...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry thought that he would soon encounter To the second impact, indeed. But this time he ran into a soft barrier, and there was a force that could hardly be opposed to push him to the surface of the water - the clear water was separated in front of his eyes, splashed everywhere, dazzling light and fresh air rushed to his face. . The elf discovered that he was on the verge of suffocation. He greedily and instinctively took a deep breath. He had to say that this movement was quite timely, and his body flew into the water after a short flight. Then he saw a huge squid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may not be as long as the scorpion in the snow cover swamp, but at least it is as long as tens of feet, its head is not as narrow as 鳗鲡, on the contrary It was very long and wide. When the elf opened, it was like an almond-colored tent filled with sharp teeth. It swallowed Kyreben all at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry’s left hand has already held his “starlight”, but when he stabbed the squid’s tongue, he stopped, because he thought of a Possible: "Kremar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tongue of the squid fluctuated slightly, but did not swallow him or spit it out. Kerry knew that he was right, and the joy came to his heart. His body had gradually recovered from the paralysis. The elf turned over in the mouth of the squid, half-squatting on the thick and moist tongue. The hand grabbed its teeth, but the other bumps that followed him almost slammed into the fine nets of the knife - the sun and the air penetrated through the cracks of the squid and the slightly open lips, the elf knew This is the squid once again surfaced on the water - the squid can breathe in the water, the elf can't, and the scent of the wind passes through the split of the squid. Mixed with tiny water droplets, the elf held a breath and took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squid that has been changed by the lich has only stayed on the water for less than one breath. After all, he does not know if there is a mage or a "magic eye". "Staring at them, fortunately, the dark gray skin of the squid can be well hidden in the galloping starlight river. They did not encounter more attacks or blockages, or the chaser had completely handed them over to the Starlight River and the Silver Falls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squid’s poor eyesight, but the hearing is very sensitive, humans may be so close to the waterfall because of this constant thunderous roar As a result, the senses are numb, the squid does not, and the former undead can clearly distinguish their differences - they are rapidly approaching the end of the Starlight River. The river roared and struggled forward, just waiting to jump from the height of thousands of feet into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just an ordinary giant squid, they will never die, but the undead will never make such a low-level mistake. The choice of deformation is a notorious monster in the swamp. Although it can also be called squid, it is much stronger than the squid that people are keen to roast and cook. The lich manipulates him. The new body sneaked into the water - by the talent of the fish sensing the direction of the water, looking for the strongest one - when he smelled the bloody smell of humans, he thought he had to admit that it was a lucky guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw the thick tentacles, he swayed his "tail" and approached it. He found that these people survived not by chance, the highlands. King Norman’s inner library really has some good things to plan. The translucent film wraps Leona and others. They are full of fear, but they can breathe and see a huge squid swimming towards them. When Mei Mi can still have that gap scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this magical device that protects them may not last that long, even if it is the poor vision of the squid, the lich can see the magic light above. It is flashing ominously, and he does not feel that this protection can persist until they climb out from the bottom of the Silver Falls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something knocked on his teeth, the lich opened his mouth, and then Leona and others saw the elf like a small squid being contained in the mouth by this giant squid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf anxiously made a common gesture between the adventurer and the thief, the thief Gülen was half-side, he had only one eye able to barely see the outside, There is still one hand, but for the thief, one hand is enough. No one knows when the thin silver rope slipped into his hand. He hesitated for a moment, then he went to the elf. Stretched out his hand - the rope slammed out and hit the translucent barrier that protected them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei was yelling, but the thief didn’t want to hear or hear it, he tried it again, and after another failure, the rope was angrily supported. Half the body, swinging back and forth like a snake - the lich took a look, the tail of the squid picked up the ball and slammed it into the air - magic almost failed at the same time. The people who were entangled in the tentacles had widened their eyes—they were no longer under the river, but the void that made them more fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst thing is that they have been entangled in the fact that they have protected their tentacles in the initial impact and are now turning into thin, indescribable shadows. In the sudden changes, the activated silver ropes entangled them in time, and then they could not wait to jump to the owner, the squid slammed his head and bit the rope with the fine teeth. Its body is flattened in the breath and expands to the sides, which looks like a very common feminine item in the plane of the alien soul, but this unsightly appearance temporarily saves them all. People - the squid is falling and gliding, rushing straight and accurately towards the outer edge of the waterfall, with an elf and four humans falling into the white droplets that are almost flush with the tip of a tower - - The distance that squid can pass is not far, but it is enough. The huge force generated by the water flow of the Starlight River pushes them far away rather than dragging them into the abyss of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the water, Kerry was spit out of the squid, and the elf climbed out of the water. Climb to the smooth back of the squid, then pick up the others one by one with a silver rope. The worst of the four is Leona. Her head was hit by a secret silver when the flying wing was disintegrated. The nail hit, and when they encountered the first impact, the king woke up and crushed a rune coat of arms, the magic contained in it saved their lives, but after a fierce bump, Leo Na kept vomiting and fell into a coma again; Baldwin was hanged by the reef because the head was exposed outside, tearing half of the ear and grinding a cheek, but as long as it was treated, it was very Healed quickly. What is more worrying is that he tries to catch the two ribs that Liona was broken when he was tightly bound by the tentacles; the thieves and Mei Mi are the two most beneficial in the magic of the Lich, the tentacles are from Derived from the shadows of the thieves, the tentacles are entangled and wrapped around them. Naturally, they are centered on thieves and plums, although the mucus on the tentacles makes the skin covered with plums without clothes all small. rash. In addition to some scratches, the thieves have only one loose tooth that is hidden inside the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona was placed on the back of the squid, and Kerry Ben took out a bottle of healing potion and poured it into her mouth. Then, Baldwin, Mei Mi shared a bottle with Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about Craigar?" the thief asked, breathing slightly. He did not suffer any injuries. But in the short moment of the Starlight River has consumed his power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here." The elf patted the skin of the squid with mucus, and laughed and saw the thief revealing a weird look, like eating a spoonful of The fragrant and hot eucalyptus sugar, he did not dare to sit on the back of the squid, but now he will put it in the water and he will definitely sink straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't care too much," said the elf, "Cremar is a good boy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The thief never felt so, whether it is good or a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And," the elf continued: "If Cremari is willing, you can remove the words of the adult in the future." It’s more ironic among the adventurers – he certainly knows that Gülen is a little afraid of the black hair caster, but most of the non-believing guys will fear the mighty people without any reason, even if they know that they are somewhat upright. The strong will not exert power on the innocent weak for no reason, perhaps because they often make the latter behavior, and inevitably imagine others as what they think - and there is nothing wrong with it. After all, Gülen is a thief, and a thief is almost a crystal of despicableness and evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think," Mei Mi said palely: "We still need a boat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She said as she supported her body and looked around, her eyes brightened when she saw a bright spot: "A boat!" She shouted happily: "A boat!" This means they are very There will be hot water, bread, wine and a soft bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry stood up, but his expression told Gülen that what he saw was not very pleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gold female portrait of the bow," said the elf: "What do you think of? Glan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Damn!" Gülen said: "It is Drake's Golden Lady!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thieves were still holding the hope that Drake could not find them, but this illusion was quickly smashed by the ruthless reality, and the bow of the ship was like a three-legged boat with a full-length portrait of a female. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More disappointing is that when the ship is hundreds of feet away from them, the ship slows down and begins to spin around them, a black spot rising from the ship And they flew over to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a mage, and it’s the familiar person of Gülen, the mage of the Thief’s Thieves Guild, who also bought a demon from him. Like to defend against enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh~" The guild's mage said in his usual, pretentious tone: "Look, see, who is this?" A gesture: "Isn't this our most outstanding and best... and the most proud of Xiaolan?" He bowed funnyly. "I didn't expect to see you again, my dear friend. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am also." Gülen replied that many of the black hands that pushed him into the deadly trap did not lack a pair of Masters. He did not know that this was Why, but don't have to go into it. After all, he won't go back to the "Silver Fingers" Guild. If possible, he would be willing to poke a knife on the stupid fat face, but they are now at an absolute disadvantage. Looked at Kerry Ben, if the elf has a chance to take out his longbow, maybe he can shoot this guy down, like a birdie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he tries to do something that draws the wizard’s attention elsewhere, a spell has been hit on the squid, and the spell used to dispel magic takes effect. A few of them fell into the mixed water of the river and the sea with some bitterness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think there should be a big mouth squid in the sea." The wizard snarled hypocritically, then made a gesture, shining light on his fingers, gold The lady’s desperate eyes in the thief slowly swayed around and approached them—warm sea water could not bring thieves a little heat, they are all immersed in the sea now, and the black-haired caster caused the guild mage’s vigilance. He flew a little farther and made a spelling gesture, but he was relieved when he saw that the opponent's caster seemed to be in a weak state, even if he needed the Elf Ranger support to be killed, but he did not take it lightly, he withdrew. A spell, instead of another long and swearing spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catch them, but don't kill them!" Drake shouted: "They deserve a golden island!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
