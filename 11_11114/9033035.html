			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gülen returns to the "empty house", the magical star river has been tilted to the west by about one-third, although the thief can't see the magical river. But still can clearly distinguish the brightness of the sky and the brightness of the ordinary stars - originally in his shelter in the port of Hong Kong, there is also a similar thing to the black hair caster timer, but it Like other things, since he was handed over as a scapegoat by the "Silver Finger", he did not know that he fell into the hands of the hybrid (probably the guild's mage, the precise timer has always been the heart of the casters) But Gülen doesn't miss it very much. First, it is not necessary for sophisticated thieves who can count with breathing and heartbeat. Second, he can always get such a thing, just like he had accumulated so much before. Like wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three "empty houses" they rented are linked together in an asymmetrical triangular distribution, of which only the house shared by Gülen and Bywin It’s dark, the other two have a faint light, and the empty house between the dark blue sky and the deep black sea is like a kind of delicate and beautiful toy because of its main body. The structure is a coral relationship. There are fine holes in the whole body. Light is projected and refracted from these holes, just like the millions of grit-like transparent stones embedded in the white alabaster. -∽-∽-∽-∽, mvc⊕om, another gentle like sea water, even the reflection in the water is so pure and flawless, perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene makes it impossible for a thief who never cares about these to stop for a while and then take his attention away. Tasty and sweet aroma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guilan recognized the pot that had been held in the hands of plum, and it was half buried in the ashes of charcoal, keeping it hot. Temperature, there is not only a large piece of crab meat, but also several crab feet that have been broken up to taste. Considering that the thief may come back very late, Kerry has left him with the part cooked with red curry. - The soul of the opposite world is not a person who is good at cooking when he is in this position. But he has a strength that he won't lick spices and sugar (although he puts more curry), the white crab meat is immersed in the sticky soup of red glutinous rice, and the flavor is as strong as you can reach it. Even a person who is already full may not be able to receive this temptation, not to mention that Ge Lan has long been hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole dusk and half a night he was busy with trading, blood red wine and rum pushed on the black table, the tabletop There are indeed some foods on the wine, but they are all special foods of the Red-throat Port - starfish, sea cucumbers, jellyfish and a very pointed snail. They can't eat anything at all. Except for the big and the fleshy, there is nothing. the difference. There is such a disgusting smell of scent - if you can let Gülen find the first guy who wants to take these things to eat, he will kill him with a knife and a knife, the bright starfish is Steamed and cooked up, you can see the solid pustules and the dark green things like the cockroaches. Of course, you can call it starfish, and the local people sprinkle it. Salt, poured on the spirits to eat, and Gülen tasted the first one and sent it and all the things in the stomach to the floor of the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to escape the starfish, he ate the jellyfish, which was then made from the skin of the jellyfish. By the way, a mage who passed through the Red Throat Port gave it a nice name, called the Sea Moon, but to Gülen. Whether it is the sea sun or the sea moon or the sea stars can not change this thing is like the end result of a tasteless colorless cowhide, until now he still feels heavy in the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that you have the first two, how can you lose the sea cucumber? This kind of thing looks like a brown big locust, it tastes the same, it is also placed in the soup. Stand with its spikes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally he couldn’t help but ask who put the things on the table first, and a colleague told him that these were originally slave foods until some The lords felt that it was too wasteful to give them food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s good to eat." The man snorted and sipped his ginseng soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry's hand to Gülen's skin not only has hundreds of gold coins, but also a dozen unstained gemstones - this stone is in chaos The zone can also be used as a hard currency. There is no good thing in the hotel. At the very least, fresh fish, lobster, lamb or chicken are still there. The problem is that Gülen is not prepared to make himself too conspicuous. Drinking a cheap ale or rum is not a big deal, but if you are willing to spend too much on food then you have to pay twice or three times what you want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But your master doesn't seem to be such a jealous person." That person, he is a thief in Red Throat Harbor, no union, in Longhuo Island It is very common that the lord does not allow anyone to control the authority to transcend oneself. The priest and the thief are in a position to seek the island's shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are my master too." Gülen took a rum and diluted the smell of starfish with the smell of spirits - He did not have a companionship with the caster, which would only bring extra vigilance and only be hired by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But these things - some only the caster will need... Is this what your master wants?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem is that I don't want to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can raise the price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You asked me to lie to a caster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Not the same money from inside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, not the same, you certainly don't mind when a dog wants to eat a bone. If it wants to eat the meat in your soup?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The price we can't get what you want."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does Red Throat Port not only be this hotel or pub right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be too aggressive."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People suddenly interrupted their conversation, Gülen from many A glance between the gaps in the body, a woman, or a female slave is being towed into the front hall of the hotel. Obviously, it is possible to open a gamble today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German put his dagger on the table - not the fine gold dagger, but from one of Cooper’s crew, The texture of the steel, the sheath of the shark skin, he pulled out the dagger, and the blade of the dagger shimmered with light light. This is the magic effect he asked Krimari to do. In fact, this is just a trick, but it is enough if it is only used to warn or deceive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay... well," the man raised his hands and was frustrated. "It’s a ghost, the casters are always generous." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not a caster." Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man got up and left, but his glass was still in the same place, and there was about two or three ounces of rum in the cup, which means he still wants Coming back - in a strong man - his arm was lined with a shackle with two scimitars underneath. It shows that he is an important person on the pirate ship. When the fifteenth wound is left on the chest of the female slave's cognac, the man is back. He opens the sacred skin bag and lets Gülen see the goods. The things inside are very complicated. But the quality is not bad - some of them are still with ominous blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like the thieves' guild, there are also mages on the pirate ship, they will leave what they need, and the rest will be replaced with gold coins. There are also some casters who are often ridiculed by stolen thieves or stolen by the assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German quickly chose what he needed, and the contents of the note had been firmly squeezed into his heart, and then according to the previous good The price - although that person has been unwilling to swear. But Gülen is not a newbie. He knows that the person is as satisfied with the transaction as he is. The sale in the dark is not always as clean as people think. Sometimes they are more keen on bargaining than street vendors. Indifferent to the performance of gold coins may even make them mistakenly think that you treat them as a sly look - they will be extremely angry, and you will never want to know how much trouble a character like this will bring you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief also stood up when he left their desk. It is both escort and surveillance. The places they need to pass include the front hall surrounded by crowds. The clinking of silver coins and gold coins into the barrels is endless. When the man managed to remove a drunken half-orc, Gülen paused a little. His eyes fell on the female slave. She didn't have a thing, she was not bound, but even the knife fell on her. She is also motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hotel’s torch illuminates the area, because of blood loss, her dark brown skin has a layer of grayish white, and the thief notices that her back has a The big square is imprinted, the big one covers almost the entire back, and the top is written with the correct font of a baby's palm. "I am a slave of Longhuo Island." The following details "write" to see which lord she belongs to. In which region, which official, which manager, which manager, what work, how many times to breed, how many times to give birth, no exaggeration, you only need to look at the brand of new and old, you can clearly see Finish her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" That person: "Do you want to bet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No." Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first crab meat was sent to the mouth, the thief almost immediately threw the slave behind his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerland hesitated when he saw the oysters that Bydwin had left him, but he used his dagger to smack them one by one. The taste of raw oysters is hard to describe, but it is much better than the starfish meat anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the spell book that Alva gave you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The soul of the alien, this spell book and part of the casting material is placed in a pocket, it is not Alva's personal copy, his spell book may not be suitable for the current black hair caster, so this is his After the disciple's spare spell book, after knowing that Kremar's pocket was stolen by the monster, the three mages discussed it. Alva took out his pocket and his disciple gave his spare. The spell book, and Antonio added a part of the material, so the black hair caster is not as good as the player who was forced to sell all the card props in the Monopoly game to spend a long and dangerous time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spells used by the disciples of Alvara’s disciples are up to six spells, but enough for the Lich to deal with most of the current situation, just Alva is still Antonio, or a disciple of Alva, who has not put paper and ink for copying scrolls in the pocket, and some casting materials - each caster's casting habits are different. They are good at tending spells, but each has its own spring and autumn. Kerry is aware that Kremar is gradually forming his own system. No, it should... He seems to have a framework from the beginning, and he What has been done all along, is to strengthen and solidify his system, which is different from the caster that Kerry has seen – even the elf. They will be half-hearted in the early days of becoming a mage. They may be hesitant. There may be a stage where they will like to use lightning bolts. After a while they start to control the flames more, but in the end they may be fixed in the force field, sound waves. Even the illusion above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Dragon Grammar Book?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the same pocket." Kremar: "I think that the monster may come for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry’s head, after coming to Longhuo, he also Seriously considering this issue, this inference may be the most correct. He doesn't think there is anything else in Creemar's pocket that can attract such a sly and patient monster... maybe even a disguised devil, in any case, its owner will not be a general generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but let Kerry really come, he does not want Kremar to keep the spell book. Even if Crimmar does not know the dragon language, but the dragon grammar is a powerful and evil spell, and the caster is always eager for strength, he is worried, if there is one day, the body of Cremari The greed contained in the other half of the blood overshadowed the calmness and reason given to him by the blood of the elves. Will he try to interpret the book in order to obtain the glory and glory that he should not have? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf didn't want to know what Cremaar knew. He had relied on Cremal's trust in him, checked their bags and the new pocket, and he was worried that his fingers would be burned by the hard and smooth cover when he reached the skin and the pocket, but there was no . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar has never lied to him. If you can, Kerry really hopes that half of the black people will retain the white thoughts and pure souls as always... but he also knows that this is impossible, which is why Gray Ridge will insist on serving for sixty years. The reason why the half-elf was expelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan's work is doing well, and the souls of the outside world check various materials. The lich will start to copy the scrolls tomorrow, and they will start looking for gnomes when they are ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva Master reminded, Master Beavis. That is, Kreima’s “mentor” is the son of a lord on the Longhuo Island. Although he has never explicitly mentioned his family with him, he did when he settled in Bibi Dyke and Baita. Someone from Longhuo Island sent him gold coins and gifts. The building where he and his wife lived was a gift from his father. Otherwise, even if Beavis is a caster, he may not be able to adjoin the governor. And live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they can’t find the gnome who can build a magical arm for Baldwin by their own power, they may need to be to Beavis’ father, The Lord of the Fire Island is asking for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wide Dolphin" lost a large amount at the gambling table, this for her The slave came, it was a very lucky thing, because she didn't have the extra money to buy a new slave, and she always wanted a farmer who could help her carry the goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lives in a hotel with her slave, don’t get me wrong, today’s “wide dolphins” don’t have the money to live in a furnished room, she Even a room shared by several people can't afford it, at least for a few days. So she and the owner of the hotel slept in exchange for her power to sleep on the ground in the front hall after the hotel was snoring - the dead bet had just been towed away, the ground still had temperature and bloody smell, and the condensed blood would be gray The slate gap is filled up, sleeping on the "wide dolphins" only feels a burst of chills, feeling that he is about to become a cold gambling, she told her slave to lie at her feet, then put that The two rough feet were stuffed into the slave's abdomen. This is probably the only place that doesn't feel like shelving. After all, there won't be long bones. The slave's body temperature warms her feet, but it's still too thin. "In the half-sleep and half-awake, I licked my mouth and decided that her seventh slave must be fat." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
