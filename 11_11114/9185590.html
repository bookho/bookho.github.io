			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Crimal, Afra laughed, no, not the kind of laugh that people usually think, she learned long ago How to hide the smile in the eyes of the drooping eyes and the corners of the numbness, but even if it is hidden deep, it can still be seen in the eyes of those who are as sharp as the soul of the alien world and full of goodwill to her. The stars are shimmering and shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not like plum, except for the gemstones of green and amber, her dark hair is rolled and spread on her shoulders, nose The outline can be described as sharp, the tip of the nose is slightly bent, the lack of bloody lips is like a gap, and the sharp chin, the back of the head from the ear, these are all inherited from Gülen. If her mother is still alive, the soul of the outside world can't control her thoughts, how much she will love this child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness." She said that her voice is not as crisp as a child should have, but rather hoarse and dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You need to drink some potion," said Kremar. "Otherwise you may not be able to stick to the end of today's work."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potion is bitter, just like most healing potions, but at the bottom, it deposits heavy honey. If someone just observes or shakes, it is impossible to detect this little secret. But Afra is smelling the honey when it is first time to drink the potion, even if it is hidden in a disgusting potion - the amount of honey is small, so small that there may be only one spoon Bottom, but this is the only sweet taste that Afra has been able to taste in his seven years of life. And the potion can give her a devastated body a chance to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afra is returning the missing silver cup to the invisible servant, and during the next preparation time, she sees her while taking off her robes. His Highness has turned around and checked the reels and the instruments that will be used - perhaps because he does not want to see her light / / / naked body relationship, Afra thought, her body is not good-looking, even It can be said that it is ugly. Although she has more self-healing speeds than other apprentices, because of her humble status, there are many people who can use whip and soldering iron on her, so her scars will always be stacked. Because there is very little food and water, her body has no children's roundness, only dry and angular, the skin is bleak blue and white, thin is like a piece of paper, the hands and feet are even thinner than the cockroach. Anyway, she never felt that she was good-looking. She admired the pastors not only because of their rights and honours, but also because of their rosy lips and their full breasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female priests have gradually become more tolerant recently, and Afra knows that this is because they can meet her with His Highness, Kremar. After all, not all of the priests of Gredi were able to enter and leave the palace at will--unfortunately, Afra said sharply that the power to bring her here seems to have been monopolized by several high-ranking pastors. They will stay in the room under His Royal Highness, and when they see them, every inch of their skin is like the heat of a fire, and Afra can get a little benefit, like a barbecue. A cup of clean water, or a job that is bound to be punished. But Afra is not happy at all. She is biting the meat of the priest when she bites the barbecue, and drinking water is like sipping their blood. As for the whip, she already Get used to it, what is the relationship once and more? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she also knows that she is a little mouse now, even if she is an apprentice, she is just an apprentice. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the soul of the alien turned around, Afra was lying on the hard stone platform without any scorn, she closed her eyes, but even She was closed her eyes, and she could feel the underarms coming. The tiny air flow from the robes made her shudder for a moment, then the soft fabric fell on the lower part of the waist, leaving only the head and neck, back, and knees. The place below the top three inches. Afula held her breath and waited quietly. She could feel the finger of her Highness gently placed on her back. The finger of her Highness always seemed to have a little warmth, and she had seen and touched with Afula. Every Grinada person I met was different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afra's back is like a blank scroll on a scroll and spelt spells, full of strange symbols, words and lines, online The place where the strip meets the line is also inlaid with gems - the body of flesh and blood is certainly not secret silver, or gold. If the base of the gem falls in the flesh, as time goes by, it is gradually rejected by the new flesh and blood. Going out, or being gradually wrapped up by them, is like a pearl in a shell, so the only place where the base can be fixed is the shoulder blade and the spine. There are long nails on the base of the stone, and the nails are attached. Magic can make it root in the bone like a living thing, and expel the new flesh, so the flesh there only avoids the position of them. If someone removes the nails, then there will be a hole with deep visible bones. The strange thing is that the edges of these holes are even smooth and covered with skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She should feel very cold, Cremari thinks that the temperature around them is slightly higher, but it is also very clear that this meager kindness cannot be compared with the suffering that Afra is going to suffer, but from another perspective Say, what it has to do, in addition to being able to guarantee that Afra will not easily become a waste of consumables, also has an unspeakable benefit to her. In Grenada, nothing can be more trustworthy than one's own strength. And something more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Familiar pain came, Afula opened her mouth and gasped in silence, she tried to relax and transfer her thoughts beyond the pain The place - for example, the faint breath from the underarms of Kreima - the first smell of the Grinada people is sulfur, because the red dragons always have a strong smell of sulfur. Even when they are incarnate as human beings, in order to express their enthusiasm or respect for the Red Dragons, the external spices used by the Greinada people are always mixed with sulfur; the second is the sweetness of the blood. People in Granada like blood wine, especially fresh blood wine. In the face of everyone, twisting a pigeon into the neck and letting blood flow from its mouth to the wine is the most common sight in the pub. One; as for the third, sometimes it is myrrh, sometimes it is musk, and sometimes it is rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only there is almost no smell on the body of His Highness, and if it must be said, it can only be said to be water, the cleanest water and the smell of air, It's cold, but it feels comfortable and enjoyable. Afra is breathing deeply. This is one of the few comforts she can get in the next ten or more days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outer world is head down, the smell of bleeding is slowly appearing in the air, and many auxiliary instruments can be used in magical tattoos, from the enchanted Mithril Pins to the devil's teeth and spikes can be, but the souls of the outside world use only those who belong to themselves. It is not difficult to condense the power into an invisible blade or a needle on the enemy's head, but it is like controlling one. The roots are shaped like tiny hair-like needles that control them just to "snap into" the warm flesh and blood, rather than tearing and rolling. Before they have received the teachings of Edel, they are absolutely afraid to do so - - In particular, his power can easily break the twist of the steel armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a small part of what needs to be engraved today. The soul of the outside world has felt that his head is like the pain to burst, in this respect. He can exchange the feelings of each other with Afula - but the final step is still to be done. It puts the finger at the end of the line, chanting the spell, and the power of magic is transmitted from his fingertips to the line. Afula can feel like a living snake, and the scales are made of red iron, which is moving from the back of her back to the rest of the tattoo, speedy, or slow. She has no way to tell, maybe in the hundred years of sinking into the darkness, or a glimpse of it, she is awake again. She sees a pair of black eyes, under the white fluorite, they There is a pocket of Afra, hidden inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"End?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"End."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her Highness stood up, and when he recorded something, Afra wore a robes, and before she got out of the room, she pulled Lakrimar's robes. The latter turned around intentionally. After a pause, the soul of the outside world bent down and hugged the slender and thin child. He could feel the fleshy bones separated, and the young heart screamed like a song. With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Bernard has heard, and the most intense quarrel between His Majesty and His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berner slipped out of the ladder, thinking that he might have to be grateful for the repairs, repairs, and Master Gavin, the two princes. The attention was almost always attracted to them, because Xiu and Gavin did not have the qualification to stay in the court, so Lei Zhe and Raymond sneaked out from the court, if they found the repair, the unlucky Thunderbolt lord It may have been entangled with them for a long time, Lei Zhe was completely fascinated by his father's past, and Raymond knew that he would inevitably be the lord of Thunderbolt in the future, and he urgently needed to know everything about Thunderbolt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berner hopes that the repair can last for a long time, at least after the King’s Majesty and the Queen’s Highness have finished quarreling, then let the two naughty men come back, then Bernard is sure that he You can give them something to do, lest Lezhe and Raymond be panicked or angry because of the quarrel between their parents. They are only seven years old, and their bodies may grow up, but their thoughts are still simple. naive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
