Dylan Don Clay asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I insist," Liona said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan turned to look at Kerry Ben and Kremar and others, his sight only slightly stayed on them: "Berwin? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is ill." The priest of Ilmot replied. He hesitated: "But I think," he said to Leona. "If you just want to complete the ritual you deserve, he can still stick to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." Leona smiled and said: "He is a very strong person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I can't persuade you to change The idea is embarrassing, "Dylan said unpredictably:" But please don't forget that the crime on this sinner is very heavy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will prove He and my innocence, Dylan," Liona said calmly: "One day we will return to Norman in the Highlands with a reputation of pure whiteness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan smiled, and the things hidden in the smile were unclear: "Okay," he said simply, Leona is the daughter of Lao Wang, although she was excluded before the change of the inheritance law. Outside, but as the only remaining blood of the pharaoh, even the new king John has to show the kindness, and Dylan, as her cousin, has no right to her. Law or practice to intervene: ". As you wish," he said, and bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was about to leave with his mage, Leona stopped Dylan: "Wait a minute, my dear cousin," she was polite. Vaguely said: "Anyone who is standing next to you, who is neither wearing a black robe nor wearing a red robe, is a lord of multilinguality?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan bows his head Glanced, short and fat, the two shiny upper front teeth were like the Mole, and the man outside the lower lip pinched his gloves in fear - his eyes turned around and saw him. The nephew (a pale teenager is standing in a corner of the room). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How, Your Highness," he said, "Is there any problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave him," Leona said. "I need a room that can hold the required ceremonies, and some items that must be prepared. I want to ask the owner of the place to help me. Maybe he still Can be one of the provers, a lord should have this obligation and honor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The multi-spirited lord said in his heart, "I will not take out my treasures and the house, just for a hybrid that is full of sin." But this is not what he wants, but Dylan brings up the staff. With a sharp end, gently point in the direction of Leona: "This is your pleasure," he said. "Go, meet all your wishes, don't let me hear you are disrespectful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord of the Spirit has to go to Leona with sorrow and a deep bow to her. "Your intention is my wish," he sighed a little from his nose: "Please let me know as much as I can," he said slyly. "I will always do it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't look at other people when he spoke, just like Dylan had no other things worthy of respect in this room after he left. - He is especially dissatisfied with the pastors. They actually saved their nephews back. The gods are on, how painful is human beings living in this world, why don't you let this child quietly leave here, Go for a walk on the plains of mourning. He swears that he will hold a grand funeral for his nephew, or that his wife and his two daughters, he does not hate his wife, the problem is that his wife is still a lord, he is also That is to say, a mediocre knight was engaged in a marriage contract with him. She was one of the daughters of the Polylings, and the dowry was meager and ordinary, and he could bear it. But since his brother has usurped his territory and title, and the stupid woman has protected his nephew, his attitude towards her has plummeted if she died. His nephew is dead, then he can calm down and marry a woman with noble blood and rich dowry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's better to be stupid, not too smart, his wife is too smart, but not too stupid, just like standing in front of him Red-haired woman. He is very exhaled in his heart, it is hard to imagine, there will be people who dismiss the position of Norman’s first heir in the Highlands. If he is, don’t say it is a rough and dirty man, even his lover, daughter, his Son, or the incarnation of Fro, he is willing to give up, with this crown of the great kingdom, what else can't be obtained, there will be thousands of princes, lords and even kings willingly linger in her At the foot of her, kissing her skirt hopes to get a look, a finger, and now she wants to give up all these for a sinner, stupid, really stupid, he shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the order to block the spirits? Are you under?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The chunky man nodded absently, his young redhead woman It is impossible to come up with all the respect and fear of Dylan. She will soon become a worthless sinner. She has no identity and no power. She has not had a beautiful face. He is critically thinking. He does not need to be jealous of such people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know that your nephew has complained to me. Have you used the unclear means to capture the title and territory that should have been inherited by him?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord of the Spirit has opened his mouth: "But isn't it, the old dog is dead, the puppy who is still breastfeeding will only bark," he said without hesitation. Said, just like standing in front of him is not a noble prince but a humble peasant woman lying on the ground, "There must be a wise man to come to the name of Lorenos not to fall into the dust - you see, My approach may not be justified, but my choice is really correct and there is no more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are also trying to kill your nephew in order to reach For this purpose, you hire thieves and assassins - after he gets your wife's protection, you want to take the disease to take their lives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The multi-spirited lord licked his lips and glanced around, only two of them - they seemed to unwittingly walk to the consul's prayer room. But this prayer room is more like a small armory. Except for a black iron base and a balance of the Mithril tray, the decorations are almost all kinds of weapons and armor. Everyone else is left in the next room. In the red-haired king, her back stood facing him, as if she was admiring a unique, unique, two-handed sword. This sharp-edged sword is often used by law enforcers because it is more than a normal male. The shoulders are flush, so there is no scabbard, just wrapped in smooth sheepskin and laid flat on a long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," the sorrowful lord whispered: "Although I have become the only master of Dolly and the nearby land, he is A boy. He has the same inheritance rights to my territory and the title, and I only have two daughters. I have been worried that he will marry one of them and then get the support of the multi-linger. This directly threatens me. Son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you have no son yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There will be "He smiled happily, and the face was more like a mole after the accumulation of fat: "I always have a son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"No," Liona said peacefully. "You won't have it." She turned and held the two-handed sword with a five-foot length. She is still only a girl, but when she carries this sword, she does not see any signs of fatigue and heavyness, just like this sword is not cast in steel, but carved out of pine with holes - chunky The man opened his mouth and looked at the flame-like red-haired woman to walk away with his own eyes. His eyes sparkled with firm light, and he mourned before he realized what she was going to do: "No, you can't do this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can." Leona replied briefly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord of the Spirit takes a wide sword around him and wants to resist, or get a chance to escape, but Leona just makes a light stroke. He used all his strength to swing out the blade and slid along the smooth sword back of the flame-shaped sword to one side, and was covered by its metal guard. Leona turned his wrist and forced him to force him. Without letting go, the wide sword fell on the ground and made a crisp knock. The flame-shaped sword had pressed against his shoulder, as if his brother’s aunt was so heavy that he could not move. Before he couldn't make a sorrowful sorrow, the curved blade was like a hot knife that had scratched his neck like a fat knife. His eyes were as prominent as a frog. He was so busy that he wanted to hold the wound that was bleeding with blood, but it was too big, and the big one allowed him to put in one hand, and his head could not help pulling it to the left. Spilled pink foam in his mouth, knees down, softly poured on the polished stone floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona takes a step back, so as not to be splashed by blood, if it’s just as Leona, she won’t do that – Tyre and Sienwo Sis is not allowed. The former requires a fair trial, and the latter is the protector of the nobility. A arrogant king is not the master who the aristocrats are willing to obey; but as a prince, this method is the best, and her father has directed her, at a crucial moment, Cruelty and arbitrariness are not bad things for a king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, at the latest tomorrow, she will lose the title of the prince, as well as her surname, army and territory. She will have nothing, just living in this world as an ordinary civilian, walking alongside her lover, she will face countless setbacks and difficulties, she does not even have the power to fight for something, so she can not do to the child Commitment - but when she saw the mortal who followed Dylan and was incompatible with the Master, her thoughts changed - at least now she is the Princess of Norman in the Highlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She calmly stares at the despicable person, his pain and despair in her heart can not look down on a wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a long day," said Kerry Ben, a sly hair that escaped from his pointed ear, on his cheek. Shaking and swaying, but the elf seems to have no strength to send it back to its original position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world agrees, one after another, and they have no time to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When is the ceremony held?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before dinner." Kerry Ben answered, originally This kind of ritual will last for three days to three weeks, because the protected person needs to fast one day, clean his body several times, and pray to Tell, asking him to prove his oath, just like Birdwin and Novo The ritual performed by Man's Pharaoh, but now Baldwin has been rejected by Tyre, and other good gods will not accept a abandoned paladin, so he only needs to bathe three times, then change to white **, red The coat and the black robe were all right, and the priest of Ilmot took him a healing potion to ensure that the ceremony would not be interrupted by the sudden coma of the protected person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly rush." ​​The soul of the outside world said - he always felt that this was more like a purpose for lofty purposes, a quick-fix form wedding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dylan Don Clay and his mage are waiting outside the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is it not better for Leona to give up her inheritance rights?” The soul of the outside world curiously asked: “The new king has not yet entered into a marriage contract with any woman. He has no marriage, and Dylan is his nephew – the nephew has no inheritance rights. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the change of the inheritance law," Kerry said: "Well, we can discuss this issue in the future, leaving us time." Many, do you want to participate in the following ritual with a charcoal and blood stain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the blackhead's caster has successfully differentiated the tree monster And the demon, destroying the nets they weave together, and letting them fight each other, but it is not so easy to send them back to their hometowns. The thieves and pastors are not hurt lightly, Kerry Ben and Although Kremar is not that serious, but because it is in the flame, the mud, and the tree monsters are like The relationship between the sap of the blood and the water seems to be like a squid that has just emerged from a stinking mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
