			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchants are certainly not qualified to meet with Crimal directly. Dada meets them in their tents and listens to their wishes very simply. What they want is always the sugar of the side island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar they can of course taste the freshest beet sugar and cane sugar, both reddish brown, infiltrated with golden honey. Only the cane sugar entrance should be rough, hard, loose and dry, and the beet sugar should be softer, moist, delicate, and the entrance is instant. Dada temporarily draws ten female slaves from the "hands" because they are "old". From the main island, although some of them are only 19 or 20 years old, because of the experienced relationship, even if the fingers are rough and the body is not as healthy as in the past, they can still take this time. Working, they use the cane sugar juice and tea to boil, add freshly picked blue berries, this blueberry has a rich sweet and sour taste and a rose-like scent, added to the sweet tea can both enhance the fragrance and can And the sweetness of cane sugar, and then boiled the steamed bun, the taro is also planted on the mainland, but they can only grow best on the Longhuo Islands. The bard describes the dragon's head as a girl's skin. soft, It is greasy and smooth. The cooked steamed buns are chopped in a silvery stalk. It is a practice to mix the beet sugar with the warm deer milk. It is not smashed, but is dug into a ball with a silver spoon. It is also a good way to eat beet sugar with a small gold fork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One long silver plate filled with crab claws, the crab claws of the hermit crab that they tasted at Red throat, but one of them Only the crab claws are almost worthy of the original crab body. Fortunately, this kind of crab never eats anything other than coconut nuts. Otherwise, Kreiber and the unintentional thoughts of Cremari may not be easy to try. This crab claw meat should be wrapped with basil and honey, or with cream, but Dada has a certain understanding of his new owner, so the meat is cooked with salted crab claws, and Mixed with ginger vinegar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course. There is also lamb and venison. Leona was surprised to eat the taste of her familiar Highlands. A baron on the territory of a baron produced a kind of edible sheep called "sweet mouth" because his territory was full of scallions and wild leek. The unoptimized spice crops are sour and sour that only the serfs and sheep are willing to put them in their mouths, but the owner of the territory accidentally discovered that the sheep who ate this grass did not need spices and would be stewed. After cooking or roasting, the serf was deprived of the qualification to graze. The only sheep that could eat the scallions and wild leeks were the sheep. He dedicated the sheep to the king. In exchange for a viscount of the Viscount, this sheep, known as the "sweet mouth", became the most common dish on the king's table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The venison is produced by the side islands. The deer on the island of Longhuo is the real native, but since the emergence of humans, these speckled four-legged creatures have to take a big step back in the food chain. The venison was very delicate, and the lords and the lords’ sons enjoyed the little deer who were still breastfeeding within three months. I can imagine how wonderful the taste is, but what makes the "Taro" fearful is that Dada asks them. It was sent to the meat of an adult deer, although it was the most delicious neck meat. But that is also the three-year-old male venison. On the main island, it has no qualifications to appear in front of the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't care about my life even if I don't care about your life?" Dada said indifferently. After all, he was still unstable at the side of the island, so these "gimmicks" had the courage to ask for his explanation. The eunuchs on the main island even asked the young eunuchs to bite and eat their own meat. Or dig out your own eyes, they will not hesitate to execute immediately, but there is always one day...: "Our new master is a half-elf, and his best friend is a silver crown." The son of the jungle. Although the elves of the silver-crowned jungle are not completely vegetarian, they are very disgusted with the consumption of cubs. At the banquet on the main island, I saw that they did not move even the lambs and chicks, but now you are going to give him A deer who has not left her mother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, "Shantou" are still dying, but they are not guaranteed big words, but Plate crab meat, not allowed to be responsible for the cooking of the slave to the inside of the basil and honey is very large, simply boiled with pure salt water and then connected with the grape vinegar is also a big order, but whether it is in the tent One person is very happy to eat, especially their new owner, his satisfaction is beyond words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan sneaked a glance at the mage, who suspected that Kremar’s stomach was also a spell, knowing that among them was a giant But the thing he ate was probably only half of the caster. The problem is that the caster's waist is only half the thickness of the former, and the black-haired mage doesn't look like he wants to vomit. His abdomen is not even convex. Pastor Fro, who was around the thief, stared at him again and again. Fro's pastor could pray and sacrifice to pray that the goddess would not become bloated because of ale and honey, but frequently The land for the little things will also cause the wrath of the goddess, indifference is still a small matter, the most fearsome is that she will plant the seeds of aging and disease into the pastor who is not happy with her, so the pastor of Fro is usually Still paying attention to the diet, Mei Mi has always been a place where she has no place to go before she meets a mage. Of course, there are not so many opportunities to eat fat, but from the hit to the kingdom of Norman in the Highlands, she Duke got a lot of benefits there, John, calm environment stable enough, then, she seems ...... ah, piling up a little fat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, these fats were eventually consumed in the jail and escape. Mei Mei was pleased to find that she did not have to pick up her golden waist chain. The problem was the banquet on the main island and the one-day meal on the side island. Let her be vigilant, the dragon fire island is never missing is honey, everyone is fond of meat, for a night or even a half-white banquet, the only thing that can be considered vegetarian is that I don’t know. How many honey juices and honey, the gods are on, they are already very sweet. She tried to restrain, but the long-term vain life made her have the same bad habits as many of Fro's wild priests, that is, she could not control her fingers and mouth. The black hair caster is also a fan of appetite, even in the snow cover swamp, he did not forget to ask the elf to collect some physalis, and squid, plum honey heard him and the elf mentioned gnome double The dragon is very much like a turkey, but his waist seems to have never changed its size. The white robes that are immortal have never been tight or cramped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei has heard that some people can still maintain a slender figure in an unrestrained situation, but the Holy Fro! Doesn't this system be a waste of a man? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last yellow-lip fish jelly that was poured with honey juice (a mixture of honey and beet juice) was delivered by Dada, he was in Kremar I kneel down and sip a cup of clear water for him. I haven’t let go of honey or spice, but it’s the taste of Cremari. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf also had a cup of clean water, then he nodded to Kremar. "He seems to have something to say to you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair caster looks at Dada, who has already kneel and his forehead is close to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to say?" The soul of the opposite world said kindly, "Let's talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Respected master," Dada said, his lips were facing the ground, but the sound was still clear and bright: "I came from the merchants and there was a sinner among them. Please forgive me. He insisted that. Say you... you gave him some... help, he was grateful for it, and now he knows you are here, he...has made a rather rude request...he...he I want to see you, my benevolent master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sinner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
