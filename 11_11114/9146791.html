Her face was flushed, her fingers tightened, and her eyes sparkled with vicious light. In front of her eyes is a chaotic scene. The hollow courtyard of the hive is full of pastors. They are not temporarily not qualified to participate in important ceremonies. They are fainted because they cannot bear more gifts, and they are replaced by others. They will Feel remorse, because in this ritual, the priests often get the most inspiration and guidance, and may even get the attention and favor of the "mother".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the reason why the chief pastor is extremely angry. She could have further consolidated her position and enhanced her strength from this ceremony, in Grenada. The temple, more correctly, this opportunity is very rare when the priest is here. After all, her power will directly threaten the superior.But these were all ruined by a damn little wife! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A priest fell to her feet, her robes didn’t know if she had to wear it or was burned, and the only cover she had was a demon The stump, it is still alive, squirming and wanting to get into the body of the young female priest, the chief priest glanced at them disgustedly, sending a hot lightning from her fingertips, running the victim together with the murderer Immediately following the chief pastor, the senior of one of her confidants, immediately twitched her fingers and threw the unsightly thing into the lava—the body fell into the lava with only a slight squeak, but then The stench and smoke are like having their own thoughts, fiercely rushing to the narrow squats, that is, several apprentices on the edge of the lava round pool, being smouldered into the mouth, nostrils and eyes. The girl immediately fell to her death. Only one apprentice pierced her arm in time and sang a spell. The mortal couldn’t see the arrow of the touch piercing the residual part of the demon. It was pointed in the air. And then disappeared, senior pastor glanced therefore - it is a blood thinner Dragonborn, resolve the matter if she is not dead, then she can have the opportunity to become an apprentice fell Senior Pastor of<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already older priests and dragons who are struggling to maintain order, and the chief pastor can see a Floor climbing on the wall of the hive as soon as he looks up. The caster knows that when you see a Fro demon, it means that there will be more Flo devils, because each Flo demon has a chance to summon the same level with his own level. Several pastors are besieging it, but there are two hunting spiders around them. The silk screens they spit out were originally used for hunting, but when necessary, they will also become shields, and the rooms on the top floor are almost always Destroyed and burned, it is difficult to find out in the scene that the hot air is distorted. It is the room that first escaped the devil.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know who called the demon?" the chief pastor asked sharply, and one of her disciples hurried down and yelled at her, "It should be Kelsey.""she says<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Aha,” said the chief pastor: “Isn’t this what I should have expected?! She is responsible for this!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think..." The disciple of the chief pastor hesitated to say: "Kelsh..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Let's talk about it," said the chief pastor. "Is there something worse than this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if Kelsey is still Responsible for this matter," the disciple of the chief pastor noticed the inconvenience of the tutor, and said in a very fast speech: "She has changed."This is a kinder saying that the Grinada people used the periodic madness and madness of the dragons because of the dragon's blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This should be a good thing," the chief pastor said dangerously. "Every dragon has to go through such a test.""Although Kelmen and Kelsey have never been, this is because even if they have the most distinctive external features of the dragons, they are still questioned and ridiculed. They are like the gnomes that are supposed to develop but not developed in humans. ——But from the mouth and eyes of his disciples, the chief pastor is keenly aware that she still has things that she can’t finish.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is out of control"The disciple of the chief pastor said simply and honestly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this time, as if to prove her words, accompanied by screams and curses, a large piece of gravel poured from a height, and a few could not escape The priest shot down and fell into the lava pool along with the gravel. The red pool water slammed high and the heat and flames caused the chief pastor to cast a magical escaping - her disciple extended her fingers into the air. Without her guidance, the chief pastor can also see Kelsey. In fact, if it is not pointed out, the girl of the red dragon is now, she may mistakenly think that it is an inflammation, that thing is like It was an upright lizard with a flame in its body. Under the influence of smoke and flame, the chief pastor could not see clearly, but she could still recognize that Kelsey (if it was) had two heads on the shoulder. One is similar to the red dragon, with the need of spines and spines, and the other is human, but the hair on it is burned, and the flesh is flowing like a melt until it flows to the chest - it looks small because Kay Now The body is about 30 feet long, not even her tail. The black scales cover the reddish skin. Some places are sparse like a fish that is about to be sent to the grill. Some places are dense. Or, to accumulate, form a neoplasm like a horny tumor. Her arms are shortened, her legs are elongated, and when walking on the smooth stone brick wall of the hive, it is like a blast. Its hands and feet should have become sharp. The nails of the nails, the chief pastor thought, some pastors evaded Kelsey, but Kelsey did not leave their hearts because of their retreat, which is similar to the red dragon's head swinging, the throat position reveals a glaring light Before the priests were able to prepare for and escape in the future, a flame with a stench smell ran through the hive, and it touched people immediately and quickly burned as if they were a candle or a torch.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if this is not the case, the chief pastor does not feel that Kelsey's character is suitable to be a priest, and that the pastor is an important place to let Red Dragon Greed personally pay attention to it, but the chief pastor may not be. ... She couldn't help but shudder. When she was the chief pastor, Kelsey could ignore her and tease her. If the positions of the two were upside down, she didn't doubt that Kelsey would always think of her. The penalties and experiments to be tried on this Red Dragon woman are truly returned to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The devil is chasing her." The disciple of the chief pastor said: "We..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Of course we will drive these demons back to the bottomless abyss." The chief pastor said: "But I think we need to find the 'door' first, you still have..." She nodded to the few pastors behind her," To help Kelsey, I and others went to find the 'door' and closed it, otherwise the demons will endlessly appear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- ———————————————————————————————————————————————< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief pastor thought that he would find the door soon, but in the ruins of the ruins, it seems that everything was burned by the flames, or by the devil and the dragon The fight was shattered, they cast one spell after another, and the things invaded by magic glowed in the murmur of light, but they were all useless (at least for their purpose) Magic runes appliances and seals, and most have been triggered in which the hidden magic, not rise any role in the. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief pastor pretended not to see one of her disciples put a rune ring into his pocket, she must admit that Kelsey’s room had A lot of good things, she saw from the hole that was struck, Kelsey was being entangled by two hunting spiders, her flames could burn off the spider's silk, and spiders - but with a wrath The Froe, the monster can only guarantee that he will not be fatally hurt. The disciples of the chief pastor surround them, but they are not trying to completely let Kelsey get rid of these demons, but to balance her and the devil. How to wait until their mentor gives silence again. Instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look here!" a pastor suddenly cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found the place where Kelsey first began to change, although they can’t confirm it now, but they can see the skin on the walls, they are miraculously Retained, as the scales were torn open, as Kelsey painfully pondered, they were glued to the walls with subtle bumps, some of which were already black and some were fresh, pastors Just take a taste and you will know that this is not human skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also shadows that are in the shadows, they come from the body of the snail, these wrecks can stay active for a long time, even if they can’t grow again The demon spider can also let a mortal die in an instant or injure a less cautious spellcaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are all carefully converge, and the chief pastor casts a retrospective spell to see if there are any clues left in the remaining instruments - in the hive It is strictly forbidden to summon demons or devils, but as a dagger inserted in a chest can also be considered as a place of natural death, there will always be people who need unscrupulous means, but Kelsey has stood at the highest point, her special identity It is even more difficult for people to make "normal" competitive behavior. She also lacks the enthusiasm for magic. This is what the warlocks in the Warlock Tower do. She often said so, so she would say that she would have a whim and want to summon a demon or a demon - the chief pastor is also I don't believe that Kelsey is a bit lacking in intelligence, but she still has at least the common sense of a Grinada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debris scattered on the ground gave the chief pastor some information, a slave, and Kelsey. "Where did the slave of Kelsey come from? She looked at her disciples and remembered that they had not left the altar for several days, like "Kyles' maid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "All are dead." A pastor said: "Due to the hand of the devil." Perhaps even the soul has been swallowed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief pastor sighed disgustedly, holding her wand in her hand, out of the devout faith in Red Dragon Greed and the Greedy The fear of the Red Dragon daughter, she decided that she could not give up Kelsey for the time being - she chose a position that would not look at the devils, broke the wand, and the magical energy screamed out and swept away to Flo. She heard the devil roaring loudly, and waited until the priests of the signal sang in unison. This is a magical technique that is extremely harmful to the abyss. If Flo is directly hit, it will be immediately sent back to the bottomless. abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
