Only the purple-eyed pheasant at Thunderbolt can There is such a long tail feather."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a lot of things here," Penny took out the box with feathers: "You can pick what you like, It doesn't matter if you take it all away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baroness smiled and shook her fan lazily - although the snow had come out outside, But the aristocratic women who are keen to emulate the Southern Kings’ courts will still carry fans with them, and at most they will change the silk into feathers: “You are so generous, my dearest friend,” she used to make men The tune of fever said: "Can this not hurt your husband's heart? Although Thunder and Wang are not far away, they can take several days - and we all know that it will soon I have to fight, but he still remembers sending so many wonderful gifts to you, the gods are on, I really love you, I think he definitely wants to see you dress up and wait for him to come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this Penny is deflated She grabbed a tail feather and inserted it into her own burdock hair. Although she was not hungry and frozen after becoming a Viscountess, she was seriously deprived of nutrition during her childhood and teenage years. The resulting sequelae could not be recovered. Her hair and the straw straw impregnated with muddy water were a color and thin and boring. Her skin was yellow and her chest and hips were as flat as a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked into the mirror, the woman in the mirror wearing silk clothes, wearing gold and gemstone jewelry, inserted in the merchants would like to use a configuration The full carriage is in exchange for the beautiful feathers, but she seems to be a serf that is incompatible with the king. Everything in her body is like a theft. She will be taken back at any time. I am hanged after cutting my limbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." She shook her head in disdain: "I am not suitable... these." She is too ordinary, even ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled the feathers down and put them in the beautiful box. Before she closed the box, the baroness gently held her hand: "Trust me," she said softly. "Penny, you are beautiful, nothing is not suitable for you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't talk nonsense," Penny pulled back her hand. "I have eyes and can see what I look like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's just because you have never dressed yourself well," said the Baroness with confidence: "Do you think every lady in the kingdom is born with beauty? No, dear Penny, the big among them. Most of you are not half of you. The reason why people can't find their wrinkles, they can't see their pouts and big noses, they can't detect their black hair and yellow spots, and they can't smell sweat and stink. It’s all thanks to meteorites, cinnabars, lead whites, mercury, and **, myrrh, rose oil and rose water...” She paused, noting with satisfaction that Penny was focused and eager to listen: “ Oh, I should have told you earlier - poor Penny," she took closer to her when Penny became a little embarrassed and reached out to grab her thin shoulders. "Of course, in addition to these, there is a little trick that is not known, Penny, we occasionally seek the help of the pastor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Priest? "This can make Penny a big surprise. In her cognition, she only has to Sudden illness, suffered serious injuries and dying people will need pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baroness’s voice is very low: “Fro's pastor.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panni Gently took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Many ladies have asked for them," said the Baroness. "They can make you beautiful and young."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that is Fro's pastor." Penny whispered, tightening her hands. She had never heard of Fro at the time of staying with Birdwin in the mountains, but since she arrived at the kingdom, although she rarely communicated, every year the Temple of Fro held a celebration, and her cook had complained about each The streets were occupied by the hustle and bustle of the fun, and she was almost touched by the ass and lost half a pound of butter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is doing this," said the Baroness. "Even for my husband, a wife should maintain a beautiful posture and delicate face." She shook Penny's hand and said with sincerity: "No husband will not want to see his wife become more pleasing, this is also about his honor and pride, a beautiful wife Like a sly medal, it is worthy of being worn by a man. - Believe me, the viscount must be so hopeful, otherwise why should he send you so many precious clothes and accessories, Penny...he The love for you can make the whole Wang Ting and even the entire Highland Norman woman stunned. Shouldn't you do something to reward his sincere and deep feelings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I...I don't know what to do..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Penny, my poor Penny," the Baroness suddenly let go. Her hand, standing up and walking around the room, seemed to be hesitant to make a major decision about life and death: a peacock-like huge and gorgeous skirt sweeping through a carpet of white bear fur After repeated several times, she turned to the young woman who was at a loss as she started, and said solemnly: "So," she said: "My friend, my dear Penny, can I trust you?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," said Penny. "You can of course trust me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then you have to swear - to Fro," said the Baroness. "If you reveal the secret that I will tell you, you will lose your husband's love for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny was shocked: "What is it like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A secret little party," Baron People said: "Every participant is a noble and noble woman. You will be one of them under my introduction." She looked at Penny, this stupid girl does not seem to understand what she meant. So she had to make her words more clear: "We worship Fro."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods are on!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is for our husband, for our marriage, for our children!" The Baroness rebuked her: "Do you want your husband to fall in love with a despicable woman, and Is the hybrid that she is allowed to inherit to inherit him and your property, title and land?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing but," said the Baroness. "Penny, you should know that even if your husband is deeply trusted by the king, he is a lord and has a heavy responsibility, but as a stranger, you In the king are unaccompanied, it is difficult to move - no one wants to invite you, your invitation is not answered - dear Although you are smart and cute, kind and gentle, but no one wants to get in touch with you, how can they understand you and love you?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even me, dear If it is not my carriage that is over your door, and you are willing to help me kindly, I can't be friends with you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
