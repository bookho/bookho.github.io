			<div id="content">Readx();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the rocky plain to the west, they passed a ridiculous gravel, and if at least the green is found on the rocky plain, then There is nothing but gray and yellow gravel sand here - because of the relationship between rain and rain all year round, even moss and lichens are traces. As the sun gradually becomes thin and cold, the weight of sand also follows. Every step is aggravated. Before the dusk is completely replaced by the night, the caravan's guide sends a long, low-pitched call. The horses and the team stop here. The caravan must change the mount and the beast here.Fire????? w?w?w?. ?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people riding on the horses have come down, the horses dragging the carriages have been untied, the saddles on the horses, etc. have been unloaded. Down, leaving only the hoe, a strong businessman grabbed two or three horses at the same time, and together with his companions, pulled the hoofed horses into the depths of the night - the horses panicked and exchanged, shaking their heads, letting The iron iron's chewings opened the lips and did not want to follow people's orders. So people began to beat them with a whip, forcing them to be gathered in a low-pitched sand, the owner of the caravan. In the dialect of Grenada, what was said, those people leaned down and/or the body, tied the reins all together, and then quickly left the chaotic hoof - not all, leaving a few people to uncover the cloak Handed over to the companion, and then pulled out the long knife, the cold light of the blade is like snow and ice in the moonlight, and the horses seem to have felt the unfortunate, they screamed and tried to break free, but the reins of the reins will only make They are getting more and more entangled, one is the most After the young horse fell, the horses around him slid into the desert with the four hooves, and the humans did not seem to want to continue to wait. They squatted in front of the body, and the blade passed through the air. Leave a bright line<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few consecutive horses have been cut off the blood vessels that are bulging on the neck, because before they were struggling, the blood spurted out. It was like a torrent of hundreds of years of spurt, it spurted into the night sky, and even the moonlight seemed to have a layer of blood--the blood quickly flowed into the sand along the body of the horse, disappearing instantly— The lich closed his eyes slightly, he could feel the depths of the ground shaking, and the hunter was attracted by the smell of blood, rushing in.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner’s tone of the car sternly reminds that all humans have left their original position and retreated to a distance of 300 feet or more from the sand. Someone removed the wooden box from the compartment. When the wooden box was opened, there was a neat steel shackle. This slinged bow was about twice as big as the average sacral bow, and it was much heavier. The smashing arrows and slings they distributed were obviously It's a matching one, and the strange thing is that there is a hook at the end - and at this time, the edge of the sand has obvious fluctuations, what is sneaking like a fish in the sand, the sound of the horse shouting more and more fierce<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“七条The young warlock closed his eyes and murmured: "No, nine, or elevenDudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too muchThe caravan owner gestured, and his deputy nodded and conveyed to everyone the meaning of the caravan owner. If there is anything in the soul of the outside world that is not very clear, then the next moment jumps out of the sand. The thing has given it the answer - it is a snake, a very large snake, each of which can almost hang from the tip of a tower to the bottom of the tower. As soon as they jump out of the sand, they bite accurately. When I lived on the head of a horse, the body immediately entangled and tightened fiercely. Like other snakes, their upper and lower jaws also took off the switch, pulling the wide open kiss to the limit, in the new moon. Under the illumination of the Milky Way, people can clearly see the patterns of the translucent skin--they crawl on the muscles of the whole body as soon as they bite the prey. The horse is at least five to six feet high and three high. More than a few feet, the weight is hundreds or even thousands of pounds, but these snakes are swallowing them as if they are swallowing a sweet and smooth cheese strip. The number of horses in the caravan can be quite large. But they seem It does not take too much time<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people held their breath in this feast, and no birds flew through the air, even the wind lost the original mania, changed They are light and soft - they can hear the sensational sounds of snakes when they swallow. Some horses will fall into the coma and die because the snake's teeth penetrate the eyes, the brain, the ribs break, or suffocate. It’s a blessing. More horses are still alive when they slide into the esophagus. Their hooves lie inside the body of the snake, so that the outer skin protrudes from a small drum kit that is sometimes absent, but this does not cause any damage to the monster. Injury - and at this time, the reins that were tied to them caused obstacles to the diners, and a giant snake began to pull violently, and the companion who was disturbed by it did not hesitate to smack it with a tail.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humans wait patiently, the giant snakes are caught in internal struggles, they are not willing to give up the food that has swallowed the belly, and they want to get more from the other side. Much - they beat, and they use each other to pour each other, until the reins are accidentally eroded by the inadvertently dripped saliva. Several of the giant snakes have been injured, their blood is transparent, and they have a strong smell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the owner of the caravan raised his hand, a burning flame fell between the serpent and their food, and the frightened serpent suddenly rose From the body - their shadow is like a tower cast on the ground, any one can become their next target, but more flames and lightning are bursting out from the warlocks hired by the caravan It was like a wall of death. The giant snakes swayed their heads, the yellow eyes reflected the fire, the venom dripped from their teeth, they were looking for opportunities, but as the caravan owners threw them into the flames. After a bunch of herbs, the smell that resembles their natural enemies makes them further weaken the intent of the attack. After all, their abdomen has been inflated to affect the action.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other merchants who may also work part-time as thieves and assassins are running lightly in shadows and fires, and the piccolo in their mouth is even more disgusting to the giant snakes. The embarrassment, after a stalemate for a while, the serpents began to slide back, away from these noisy guys - they left as fast as they arrived, and they were not out of the human eye, they had a large body Entered the sandDudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s time for humans to get paid, the warlock makes a gesture, casts a spell, is hurt by the same kind and is thrown in. The last few giant snakes were suddenly stuck in the solidified sand. They frantically swayed the tail like a rock (as it is), pulling their heads out of the sand and trying to see what it was. One thing - but before that, those sharp and long arrows have run through its scales and skin, with barbed arrows grabbing its muscles, and the ropes hanging at the end of the arrow are firmly held by humans. Grab the ground, they pulled back quietly and silently, trying to pull the giant snake out of the sand - they succeeded, the fierce giant snake stood up and half-squatted, after a fierce battle, a fur Ablation, the fleshy adult horse was vomited, and even with a giant snake stomach that could fill a whole barrel, it opened its mouth to a person, but then someone pulled the rope violently, and the serpent roared silently. But when it wants to attack that person, it is The other part has been mercilessly torn<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, under the command of the owner of the caravan, they quickly controlled five giant snakes, although one of them also wanted only one big snake. Attack the person who first hurts it, but it hasn't been able to close the cheekbones, and it has been completely killed by the warlock's spells.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
