			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei Mai certainly won’t disagree with the thieves’ help. She doesn’t like Gülen, but this kind of dislike is more than the fear of the caster, then It’s a little sorrowful – but this time she’s not so easy to leave, the thief grabbed her arm, and the moment she wiped the bonfire, something on his face made Fro’s pastor heart-- But soon the faint wave of swaying was blown away by the cold wind between the mountains. The thieves shook a little, and violently pushed the plum to walk a few steps to the side, deeply sucking a few chilly air: "Damn! What did you put in the fire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a bad thing," Pastor Froer immediately argued: "Just some dried sylvestris." Brd/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin stood up, he was stationed in the cold and barren Thunderbolt for a long time, in order to survive the long and harsh winter, people used to use hard liquor as daily Drinking and drinking, as the lord, Baldwin’s drink is beyond the imagination of the average person, but he can feel his body. Surging hot and warm, just like drinking a whole bucket of winter wine or spoiled wine: "Mei honey," he tightened his thick, thick eyebrows: "You know we need to keep it all the time." "Wake up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The effect of dried longan is not so strong," Plum said nervously: "I originally wanted a little wine, but there was no wine - I swear it will only let you relax."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What we don't need most now is to relax," the thief said as he walked aside to pick up the water bladder. Unscrew the bottle cap and drink a few mouthfuls of cold spring water: "The endless abyss is down, I don't want to wake up and find myself on the execution platform of the Norman King."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a little longan!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can't be a little negligent now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"So the first thing we should do is to throw you in that dirty swamp!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H," the thief is low. Road: "Maybe I should throw you to those hungry lizards!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Enough!" Budwin shouted, "No next time!" He glanced at the two men in a majestic manner. He had no children, but he had already deeply felt the pain of the father of two children who were not right: "No matter which one, it is the same." He said, go between Gülen and Plum.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry has already picked up the dried sylvestris mixed with plum honey in the bonfire. Plum is right, dry sauerkraut is not toxic, but it will evaporate like a spirit when it is hot or burning. After a long time, people will feel like they have a good meal, although they don’t drink the wine. The bard and the priests of some gods will mix in the incense, and the Alva Master’s hookah ingredients often contain parts. Dried longan, but the weight is calculated in detail. Ensure that the casters do not fail to cast spells due to excessive intake of dry longan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Crimall with concern, only to find that the black-haired caster was sitting on the ground, holding his cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you feel?" The elf asked with concern: "Do you need some water?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Come on," Crimmar felt a little thirsty: "But why don't you dance?" He stood up steadily and looked calm. There is nothing wrong with it: "Fro is finished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin thinks he seems to have a third child: "Not Fro, yes The ceremonies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ceremonies are finished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said the thief: "Just. Someone did something very unpleasant, so I didn’t dance.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Jump,” said the soul of the alien world: “I like to dance.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf turned a blind eye, and the thief was praying sincerely to his god, hoping that the person who followed them would not join in the fun at this time - he It is very clear to see that among them, the most important force comes from Kremar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair caster did not make any embarrassing rude behavior, he just stared at the priest of Fro. Looked at Birdwin again, and then turned to Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is your problem," Gülen warned. Grab Jimmy's hand and kick her knees and let her move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bywin?" The soul of the opposite world said seriously: "And there is a card...Ripan?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is holding on to laugh: "Well, Byrdwe, let's dance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." The black-haired caster hesitated to say: "You are all male." He thought carefully: "It's too strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it's just normal, then maybe not very strange, but at the festival of Fro. It's a bit of a violation: "Then we rotate," said the elf. "Like the previous one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cremar looked at them, "I missed me." Can summon one..." he said, then he walked to the fire. In a state of disappointment, chanting a spell and reaching out, plunging into the flame in the short scream of Mei Mi, and taking it out before Kerry’s action – his hand did not suffer any damage, even the sleeves were the same, It just like a piece of air that is shaped like a flame. A hot flame followed him - wrapped around the caster's white, slender fingers, like a vine, but it didn't take long, and Kerry could see that it wasn't a vine. It is a hand formed by a flame, the caster retreats, the hand follows, the back of the palm is a slender wrist, followed by the upper arm and upper arm, shoulder, neck and chest, and the other side of the body, when it When he was completely out of flame and stood in front of everyone, even Kerry had temporarily stopped breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fire Elemental Creature?" Birdwin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The Elf Ranger said that among the casters, the Master of Plastics and the Warlocks who are good at Flame-like spells, and the god of fire elements The priest of Kashus often has access to the fire elemental creatures. Even the small pool of elemental fire creatures often appears in the pool of elements that the Alva Master connects to the fire element plane, but like this, it has the shape and size of human beings. Fire elemental creatures are the first to see Kerry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caster summoned the fire element creature he summoned and got a return, then, it’s jaw-dropping, they are so high I danced happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait," Birdwin said: "What should I say, does the fire elemental creature have sex?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," said the elf. "But it looks like it should be a girl." The fire elemental creature is not fruit, and its outline clearly shows that she has a long and ankle. The robes, as well as the brighter hairs of the length, are more than the former. When they gently sweep across the ground, the ground suddenly has only one piece of burnt black, and the dried sylvestris that were picked up by the elves are burned. The scorching air is filled with the smell of spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
