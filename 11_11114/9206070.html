A six-year-old child who had not been educated would not have thought of it. But after he became a disciple of Piccolomini, Bishop Piccoloni was detained by a heresy if he was unfortunately accused of heresy or a witch, even though the bishop could finally be forced by the power of the family and the money for atonement. Forgiveness, or declaring innocence, must also bear the last stain that cannot be rid of. Such a piece of chess will only be abandoned by his family and those who once valued him, and will never turn over, because as long as he slightly resists The meaning of today’s crimes will pour on his head like asphalt. Then, as his disciple, Julio will inevitably be placed in the dust, no matter how much Lorenzo loves and pity his brother. Son, Julio Medici's best result is to spend a boring life as a wave, and the worst result is the hostage that the Medici family is indispensable in some transactions, or Used by other families as a tool to mock and threaten other Medici. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The words of the lie will be extinct," the bishop's gaze became more and more sharp: "Children, only heretics will use the name of the Lord to speak the devil's words." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The moment..." The child leaned forward. "One of the twelve disciples became Judas Iscariot, and went to see the chief priest." Austria whispered: "He said, I will give him to you, how much you are willing to give me. They gave him thirty dollars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since then, he was looking for an opportunity to hand over Jesus to them." Bishop Piccolomini continued. Then he skipped the middle section: "Jesus said, get up, let's go, sell me. Nearly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Between the words, the twelve disciples of Judah came, and many people took knives and sticks, from the chief priests and the people. The elders came with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The one who sold Jesus gave them a secret number and said, 'Who I kiss, who is him, you can Live in him. 'Judas immediately went to Jesus and said, 'Please Rabian, 'just kiss him.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jesus said to him, 'Friend, you If you want to do something, just do it. 'So those people came forward and took Jesus.” After reading here, Bishop Piccoloni involuntarily picked up his lips. This is just a big omission in the needle tip, but It is born in the eyes - if you are betrayed and taken by unrighteous people. Although as a bishop, he will not be tortured and tortured, but the people behind him only need to prove that he is guilty - they are not destroying his body, but his spirit... At this time, the referee is still mild, even those Civilians who are found guilty of felony may also have the opportunity to repent, to repair and return to the church, and to talk about a Piccolo. But if he is determined to have been deliberately tempted by the devil and thus left the flock of God, even if he can return to the church, he will never be fortunate enough to be appointed as a priest again, or even become a priest. He can only become A bitter monk, this life is in a strange monastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who don’t want a Piccolo to wear a full white vest (Note 1) will not miss this opportunity, not only him, even him The family is also threatened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he looked at Julio, the child also looked up and looked at the old man who still had a hint of generosity, maybe not because of them. The close connection between him, he will also give warnings and reminders, after all, in this ignorant and absurd era, it is really rare to have a person who knows how to study and think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Bicroione suddenly turned away, his sight just fell behind the door, like every room in the monastery, where a pair of wood was hanging The prints depict the scenes of St. Francis's acceptance of the sacred marks, using ore pigments made from egg whites, and the colors are clear, but it looks more like the slick brushwork of Giotto di Bondona. Stereotype and childish, perhaps the work of a wealthy priest Linyi, but Saint Francis looked at the sky, flipped the palm of his hand, and bowed to the image of the angel with blue and red wings, still clearly discernible, falling on his hands, feet, The five streaks on the ribs are sharp as five black nails, piercing straight into the eyes of Bishop Bikinoi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so hoarse and incoherent for a moment, Julio’s eyes suddenly darkened, and he was so scared that he leaned back and found that Bishop Bicroioni suddenly fell in front of him because Little Medici sits on a Skalobe chair. The chair has no armrests. The back of the chair is a fan-shaped carved board with a small drawer under the seat. So Julio was taller than his majesty's bishop. The tender and rounded knees touched his chest, and the old man placed his hands on Julio's little hand and held it tightly. His hands are thin, his skin is wrinkled like a satin, he will make a rustling sound when he rubs, his fingers are slender, his palm is wide, and Julio's hand can be stored in his palm, his skin is like A piece of soldering iron is generally burned: "This is where the Lord is saving me," he said hoarsely. "It is like an angel who landed in front of Rhodes of Sodom and descended on the face of Yanab in Jebus. In the presence of Cornelius in Caesarea. (Note 2) "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and so on! Julio retracted her hand in a blank expression. The danger of taking the fire is to save a scholar who still has this will and ability to continue to study medical research in this dark and ignorant era, not for the Lord to be more devout. Servant! Anyway, the noble old man already has tens of millions of fans (and more will be in the future). You don’t have one, you are a lot less, but a real doctor (not just a sprinkle) Holy water, soldering iron and ****), do you know how precious it is in this era? What is a cure, child! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher..." Julio bowed his head and whispered that he wanted to jump off the chair, but the hands of Bishop Bikinoi did not He caught him with pain, but the stubbornness and unshakableness contained in it made him afraid to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Piccolo gaze at the shadows of the bursts, but it looks extraordinarily bright, like the flowing gold: "You are born." It’s spiritual, the child...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Julio is really creepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, just as he was stiff, there was a sudden kick in the doorstep, which was not common in the Franciscan monastery. Because most of the monks were wearing simple thin-soled shoes or barefoot, Bishop Bicroimini stood up straight, like a tiny bird in front of a six-year-old child. Nothing like it, his look calmly passed and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't disturb anything." Bishop Perugia came out from behind the door, just at the same level as the angel on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you wear Venetian shoes," Bishop Piccolo sternly blamed: "Only the devil will put hooves on his feet, you are Want to go straight to hell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julio glanced at it, and sure enough, a little parcel appeared under the robes of the bishop of Perugia With the wooden bottom of the leather, "This is not a Venetian shoe," Bishop Perugia said softly. "It came from Florence, and it will only go to the woman's heart."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bishop of Piccoloni’s answer is to take a slap in the face, push him out of the door, and then go out with him. At the time of the evening prayer, the annoying pedaling sound disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Bishop Bicroimini and his entourage left the Franciscan Monastery in the misty silky streak. When I was on the stone road of Assisi, the people who saw them were deeply envious, and the bishops and monks would also praise and marry when they saw the portraits and holy names of Saint Francis and other Assisi saints. After the more lengthy team left the shelters of the high and low, spires or square roofs, the fog dissipated, and while they felt warm, they also saw a more magnificent and brighter sky than in the past few days. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes them more firmly believe that they have been blessed by the Lord and the saints, not only the monks, but even the guards who guard them can not help but smile, scorpion and The horses were light-footed and came to the sub-Saba Xiu Mountain before the morning light was completely replaced by the hot gold wire. The emerald-coloured Suba Xiu Mountain is large and soothing, like a breast-loving Assisi with a rosy rose, and it is reflected in the milky white mountain range from the bottom to the middle citrus and apricot sky. And the feathery clouds of the calamus in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the Asahi's white light pours down from the gaps in the clouds like water, shining on the shoulders of the travelers, bringing warmth to them, Piccolomini In the heart of the bishop, Julio looked up and breathed deeply. In the clean, cold air, there was a stream of grass and grass. They marched to the sides of the road, covered with countless wild beauty, these colorful Flowers, like humans, fall asleep at night, and the white waking up, accompanied by the hooves that bring the sun here, they bloom in a row. The goldsmith monk who walked behind Bishop Piccolo immediately took a hand and gave it to Julio to let him play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
