			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the pastors still have no knowledge of this house that has swallowed so many lives, it’s unfair, and Ilmot is stuck here. Although the priests of Crawford could not leave the multi-spirit, the outsiders could still send the message they needed - almost all followers of the gods were alarmed, and the white robes almost read through all the temples and churches. According to the records of the Grand Library, in addition to Ilmot, Cranvo, Rosada, and Tyre, the followers of Ranger and the followers of the god of knowledge, Ogmar, have extended their own A helping hand, some rangers and knights want to enter the multi-spirit, but were rejected. Any extra person may become a hidden sin before the epidemic has been cleaned up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant records they found, and then the well-preserved documents in the multilingual ruling bureau, they have almost been able to speculate on this seemingly ordinary mansion Selected as the starting point of this terrible plague - this mansion was originally an adventurer. From the perspective of mortals, he is not a mediocre person, but his companions are too good, so that he is often Buried in the dazzling brilliance of friends, the bard will only mention him when he sings the name of each individual at the end of each chapter of the Psalms, so although he and his companions have established a remarkable achievement Numerous nobles know that in the end only his companions won the title and territory, and he just got a considerable amount for the average person, but for a prominent warrior, it is a bit meager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more than 300 years ago, the adventurer was not angry because of the unfair treatment he encountered, he returned to him The hometown of the town, a town called Doring, built a house with fifteen rooms for himself and his family, so he spent the rest of his life peacefully and peacefully - his child did not inherit him. The courage and wisdom, but they have the manor and land that he bought, and they have a fixed income every year, so in the multi-spirit, they can also be regarded as decent figures with identity and body. as time flows. They, and many others in the Spirit, almost forgot that there is a hero who once dared to fight the devil, the giant and the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They forgot, the devil did not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests turned to the records, there are long poems written by the poets at the request of the king. And the rewards and written records they received from the temple and the sanctuary after they completed the task - the record is not as good as the bard's wonderful and interesting, and the victory is true, because the appearance is ugly, the origin is average, and the team is unfortunately Another companion with handsome looks and noble origins – they are all warriors. As a result, he was often ignored by the poets, and his companions gave him an extremely fair evaluation. In a record of the master's handwritten book by the team, they clearly stated that they are honest and simple. The companion, once personally sent a desire to return to the endless abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the lich hears this story, it has already speculated that the development of the future - the devil and the devil can not be completely killed by the mortal, if they are fatally hurt, they will only be sent back to the endless abyss, and the most in the endless abyss The bottom is subjected to cruel treatment like a bad demon, and he will have a hundred years to return to the main material. In addition, if he is a middle or high-level demon, there may be other devils or demons who actually kill him when he is weak, in order to gain his magical energy, wealth and status; or his The superior, the higher-order devil will punished him for the downgrade. For the devil, these two endings are unbearable and worthy of cursing and planning revenge for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the former, then the man who sent him back to the endless abyss can be said to be lucky, but if it is the latter. Then that human being is the best goal of revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe someone will have doubts, for a hundred years, except for some followers who are deeply loved and cared for by God, as long as they are human. I am afraid that it is impossible to escape, how can the devil retaliate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil will pour his hatred and anger on the descendants of this person, and all things related to this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The catastrophe of Doring is likely to be a devil's handwriting, full of patience and malice, and in revenge, while not forgetting to benefit from it, the lich does not know How many people have heard the devil's induction in the intimidation of the disease and the weakness of the body. Deliberately or unintentionally going to evil, but certainly a lot, it will be a very exciting wealth - every soul that has fallen because of a devil's plan will leave the devil's mark, There are related devils in the endless abyss to do statistics - those who are sharper, smarter, and brighter than the human beings who are the most savvy and must-have in the main material world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those pastors, the devil’s favorite souls are pure and innocent, and as long as they are casters, the magical energy contained in their souls will be greatly More than mortal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mansion has nearly twenty people living here before the catastrophe, seven masters and twelve servants, now they are already mourning The wilderness wanders aimlessly, and the devil's means will inevitably allow them to sign a contract or do evil things before they die. This survivor provides a bit of intelligence - a woman who is used to making troubles and playing with tongues. People told the pastors that there are three brothers among these people. The eldest son has been married with a good girl for about ten years. He has a lovely child. The youngest child is only thirteen years old, but he is obsessed with a foreign wife. They quarreled and beat each other more than once, and rushed to take out all the money in their homes in exchange for the favor of the beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their parents were worried, and the eldest son’s wife was in tears, day and night, but they were like what was confusing until they were infected with a terrible plague and pain, and their eldest son struggled to The house is given to the woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that woman, actually at the invitation of the master, the light has stepped into the gate of the mansion. From the second day onwards, one body after another was carried out from the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what about the woman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They didn't see her out." The priest said Looking at the open door, the door is made of dark brown carbonized oak, inlaid with a black iron fixed strip, the hinge has fallen off one, so half of it is pulled, and the onion ball hanging on the door rots Exhausted, it is a strange rot, as if all the water has been drained and the bulbs are white. Dry shrinking, the insect bites out big and small, black caves on it, and glances at it. It's like hanging a myriad of atrophied skulls on this door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't leave me too far." He warned his younger brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to enter the gate is the priest of Clanwo, who are extremely sensitive to both the living and the dead, and the special spells given to them by the god of death. They can also make them stronger than other pastors, and then Kerry Ben, the priest of Ilmot. Thieves and Cremal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you wouldn't want to join them," the Lich said softly: "You are just a mortal, a thief."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what should I do? They, and you, will you provide a scroll for me to leave? Maybe, but I know that Dylan Donkley brought his Masters," The thief sarcastically said: "Or go to watch Beewin with Mei Mei? Forget it, I would rather face a dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Rest assured, "The once undead person looked at the thief with a meaningful look: "You won't face a dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry is a Highlander Mann's, like other cities in this vast country. All of its houses are tall and mostly built into a hollow square body, which is a house on all sides, with a small courtyard in the middle, and the house facing the street is the foyer, kitchen, dining room and meeting area. The two wings are the rooms, and the innermost one is where the owner and his children sit and sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candle on the chandelier is gone, no one will change the candle and light it. They can only observe the situation in the room by the faint light from the door and window. It’s hard to imagine, just here. Short ten days. The dust in the house has accumulated a thick layer, just like it has been abandoned for several years, the thieves bowed their heads and looked at the ground: "There is no footprint," he said in a fine voice (this is also the skill of the thief). A): "When did the former pastors enter here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before six days." Kerry Ben answered him. His voice sounded like it came from a long distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Do you feel that the soul of the opposite world said that he had just swam from the bottom of the sea, at the request of the lich, he pressed Under curiosity, I slept beautifully, and now he feels very comfortable - do you think? He continued to ask, I always feel that there is something wrong with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Where? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It seems that there is a layer of what, the soul of the outside world said that he used to float up and look at the witch when he was in control of the body. The eyes of the demon, the things he saw were not real enough, but the color and clarity did not change much, but this time he saw that everything, stairs, parquet stones, thresholds, domes, and elves, pastors and The thieves are all like a layer of transparent black film. He divides his memory into a part of the lich, although he knows that his cohabitants may have seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——And, the soul of the opposite world said, is this hall so big? We haven’t been able to walk to the stairs until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former clerk of Klanwo suddenly stopped and turned around, he hurriedly counted the number with his eyes, and then stern Commanded: "Everyone immediately pulls his hand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others don’t understand, except for the Lich and Kerry, but they still follow Pastor Lanwo's command - the pastor is second only to the chief pastor in the followers of the god of death. He has traveled for fifteen years and has extensive experience in fighting abyss creatures such as the undead and the devil. The lich is pouting, so in this temporary team, he has a position similar to the leader and command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gavin!" Ilmot’s young pastor suddenly panicked and shouted: "Gavin is gone, he is still with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold the hands of your companions!" Pastor Klough had to use his tongue again. "We are standing in the shadow plane!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold My hand," Kerry Ben said. "Don't panic, your brother may still be able to come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young pastor of Ilmot ran over, Holding the hand of the elf, "Really?" he asked hopefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Ranger doesn't know how to answer it. At this time, the thief just raised his question. “What is the shadow plane?” he asked, and Gülen had a good position in his union, but he had not yet reached the point where a spellcaster could say nothing to him. In fact, there are many apprentices and even him. I don't know anything about the shadow plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A plane that tends to be evil." The elf said briefly: "You can think of it as the shadow of the main material plane, here, everything." They are all distorted, the distance will be lengthened from time to time, and we may have crossed a few dozen feet in one step, so please hold the hand of the person around you, otherwise we will be forced to disperse in a blink of an eye. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But both hands were caught and how do we counterattack when we are in danger?" Gülen said, and then he whispered a little: " Of course, I don't want to oppose you, the respectable ranger - I just want to ask, is there a better way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to use this The Lich said, and the string that the thief was familiar with was as happy as a flexible snake and climbed onto Gülen's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." The thief said that while turning a blind eye, he should not forget that there is always a Kremar around Kerry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s only temporary," said the elf. "Make sure you and the people around you are still there, try to get closer to each other. This spell is not by some of us." Otherwise, we just have to make sure that the caster is still in our sights and can guarantee that we won't lose contact - now we can only do this, but fortunately here is only the starting point of the shadow plane, the dangerous hunters are almost lurking in the darker ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a shadow plane." The Lich said: "Just someone - no, right, I can almost certainly be sure this is A devil, he may not be so strong, but he still drags a part of the essence of the shadow plane into the main material plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please simply say, respected Master." Gülen said: "Is it better or worse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately," the Lich said: “The nature of this damage is more confusing than the real shadow plane, and it is difficult to speculate.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&#& &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona originally wanted to guard her lover who was afflicted by the disease, if not there is someone who needs her more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the priest of Ilmot confirmed her honor, the dead people are like after hundreds of long dark winters Finally, I saw the beautiful sunshine again. They whispered and shouted, looking at Leona with hope, looking at the red hair and Leona’s hands, clothes and brooch. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona’s short robe was pulled again, she lowered her head, and the little girl who asked her name cheerfully asked: “You are the princess. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said Leona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So." The little girl’s mother said, "We will not be burned, right?"
