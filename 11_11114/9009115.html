Gülen asked, as he glared at the cave where the smog was constantly emerging, perhaps because the flame burned all violently. What can be ignited, the disgusting stench seems to have dissipated a lot. The black caster's little spider climbed out of the cave and smugly tapped his cheeks, making a sound that humans could not hear. Kreima listened for a while and told them: "There is nothing in the passage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin said: "We have to figure out which sheep to Where to go - more than a hundred sheep, even those who have the appetite of the goblin, can not eat them in a few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do they sell sheep to traders?" Liona asked, her eyes flashing, although the smell made her feel uncomfortable, but she was trying to get involved in the past. The story heard in the poet's songs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is such a stupid trader who wants to get close to the goblin, he will only be attacked, goods and money will be taken away, and he will be stripped. It was grilled on the fire," Gülen said, and habitually made a gesture of the next, and he grinned and snorted exaggeratedly as Baldwin glared at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glan, I and Kremar into the cave," said Kerry Ben, "Bedwin and the two ladies stayed outside."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the Master stay outside," Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can't be done," Kerry said softly. "Look at that channel, I can only advance by Kreima and Gülen." And you may have to kneel on the ground to get through, Bywin, and I am afraid that you will get stuck somewhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona laughs, And Birdwin had to shake his head and accept the arrangement of the Ranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thieves really hope that their adventure story can start from the goblin, but he doesn’t care anyway I couldn't think of what would be a bad dirty start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being burned by the flame, the narrow, low passage does not restore the first muddy dampness, but instead is the thin, hot air and the hot ground and wall until The caster gestures and the wind passes between his fingers. Bringing fresh air from outside, the thief feels slightly better. The problem is that he quickly smells a fresher stench—the air that begins to circulate again brings a smell elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are other caves," said the Elf Ranger. The caster's fire element stalked in front of them, illuminating and warming the gloomy passage, and Kerry carefully observed the surrounding situation, and the soil that was blown by the flame showed a blackened The color, but still can be seen that they are as big and small as the inside of the bread of yeast. An elliptical void that is difficult to count, his slender fingers stick out one of them and dig it up, and some reddish-brown pieces fall out inside, and the elves hold them in their hands, rubbing them, and the skin is smashed and exposed. The transparent gray-white interior, the soul of the opposite world turned curiously to see it, and it felt like a solidified silica gel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The termite's saliva." The Ranger said: "This used to belong to a group of yellow-breasted giant termites, which are often used by gnomes. They are used to plunder rather than create." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"喔噢," said the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really don't want to know how big these termites will be." Gülen screamed like a channel that could never go to the head. "The endless abyss is down. I am all over the body." Itchy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The length of an adult male's arm is so long," Kerry said: "Don't worry, since the goblin has become the owner of this cave, they These nutrient-rich and succulent foods will not be spared, especially in the queens. Once the queens are killed, the remaining termites will die in a short period of time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gnomes eat them?" The soul of the outside world curiously said: "How to eat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bite directly in the mouth "Kerry said, "But I have heard that dwarves or gnomes will put them on the fire, if they have the conditions, they can be fried in whale oil. They say it tastes like peanuts and chicken. It’s wonderful to match the taste of light wine.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ah...” comes from the soul of another plane Deeply said: "Have you tasted it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately," the elf said: "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief who walked in front of them made a face, he can only think of the feces: "Even the little goblin in the port of Mind has a better smell than here," he complained. You know, those little goblins feed on all kinds of corpses, and they have pustules full of swelling and decay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gnomes like smell." Kerry said: "I saw it in the books of Alva Master. The goblins sprinkle the droppings on their bodies like human ladies who sprinkle spices on their bodies. They even shine in the sun. The manure on the stem is then wrapped in a layer and repeated several times. But only their collars are qualified to mix blood into the feces. When a male is destined to ask for a female goblin, it will dig a mud pit. Store all kinds of meat and internal organs in the mud pit, wait for them to smell and then take them to court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evil." Gülen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire element in front of the servant suddenly stopped, and slammed two cheating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We seem to have finished this paragraph." Gülen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it doesn't," said the black caster, who pulled a piece of fluff from the pocket and released the fluff instead of falling vertically to the ground. It is skewed at an angle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The nest of the yellow-breasted giant termite is not so small." The elf raised his brooch and let the fluorite illuminate the wall. "In general, their nests will There are dozens of layers, and we only go through three layers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We Going in?” Gülen asked, as he glared at the cave where the smog was constantly emerging, perhaps because the flame violently burned everything that could be ignited, and the disgusting stench seemed to have dissipated. Quite a few, the black spider's little spider climbed out of the cave, smugly knocked on his cheeks, and heard the sounds that humans couldn't hear. Kremar listened for a while and told them: "What is in the passage? No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin said: "We have to figure out where the sheep are going - more than a hundred sheep, even those with a goblin The appetite is not likely to eat them all in a few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They may sell sheep to Li Naina asked, her eyes flashed, although the smell made her feel uncomfortable, but she was trying to participate in the story that she could only hear from the bard's songs. Go inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is such a stupid trader who wants to get close to the goblin, he will only be attacked, goods and money will be taken away, and he will be stripped. Rack on the fire," Gülen said, and habitually made a gesture of the next. He grinned as he glared at him in Bywin, and bowed exaggeratedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glan, I and Kremar into the cave," Kerry said. "Bedwin and the two ladies stayed outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the Master stay outside," Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can't be done," Kerry said softly.

The problem was that he quickly smelled a fresher stench—a re-circulating airflow that brought a smell elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are other caves." The Elf Ranger said that the fireman's fire elements are stalking in front of them, illuminating and warming up. This gloomy passage, Kerry has carefully observed the surrounding situation, and the mud that has been smashed by the flames has a blackish color, but it can still be seen that they are as big as the inside of the bread. Small, hard-to-count oval gap, his slender fingers sticking out one of them to dig and dig out some reddish-brown pieces. The elves pinched them in their hands and licked them. The skin was smashed and revealed a translucent gray-white interior. The soul of the opposite world turned curiously to see. Think it is like a piece of solidified silica gel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The termite's saliva."

Especially after the queen, once the queen is killed, the remaining termites will die in a short time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gnomes eat them?" The soul curiously said: "How to eat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But directly in your mouth," Kerry said: "But I have heard of dwarves or The gnomes will put them on the fire and roast them. If they are qualified, they can be fried in whale oil. They say that they taste like peanuts and chicken.

The soul from another plane said profoundly: "Have you tasted it?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately," said the elf: "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief walking in front of them He made a face, he can only think of the feces: "Even the little goblin in the port of Mind has a better smell than here." He complained, know that the little goblins feed on all kinds of bodies. And with a puffy bag full of swollen and rotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gnomes love stinks." Kerry Ben said: "I saw in the books of Alva Master, the goblins are pouring feces on their bodies like The human lady spills spices on her body. They even dry the manure in the sun and then wrap it up. This is repeated several times, but only their collars are qualified to mix blood into the feces, when a male When the goblin wants to ask for the favor of a female goblin, it will dig a mud pit, store all kinds of meat and internal organs in the mud pit, wait for them to smell and then take it to the court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Evil." Gülen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire element in front of the servant suddenly stopped, and slammed two cheating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We seem to have finished this paragraph." Gülen said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it didn't." The black caster said that he pulled a piece of fluff from the pocket of the dime, and the fluff did not fall vertically to the ground but was skewed at an angle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The nest of the yellow-breasted giant termite is not so small." The elf raised his brooch and let the fluorite illuminate the wall.
