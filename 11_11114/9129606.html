The new king of Grenada said that he seems to be in a consistent In the melancholy, but his eyes are hidden from the anxiety and troubles that others can't see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After all, he has been away from Grenada for some time, and the impact of others has to be counted," Mitt said, he What I didn’t say is that many people think that this is because Cremari’s body has half the blood of the Eya spirits—the Eya spirits are the enemies of the red dragons. They are superb in martial arts, agile, and incapable of magic. The power of neglect, but most of the Grenada people are still very scornful of them - because all the kindness and gentleness of the elves are weak and incompetent for the Grenada people, they whisper in the shadows, think The new king made a wrong decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is the dragon tooth now?" asked the new king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly fluctuating, but everything is still under control." Mitt replied, he kneels on his father's feet. When he looked up, he could see that his father was playing with a piece of fine gold, and the hard gold that was harder than the black iron and steel was like a soft clay in the dragon's fingers. He just pinched it into this shape and made it into shape from this shape. "Some of the less well-meaning guys are just about to move - father, do you think I should handle them on their behalf, or wait for Cremar to personally investigate? These locusts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New King’s fingers paused, a terrible pressure poured down, and Mittite lowered his head deeply, warm Water dripping from his hair, flowing from the hairline to his forehead, then blocked by thick eyebrows, and finally dripping down, quickly condensing a small dark trace on the ground: "You have resentment "When the new king asks, there is no dangerous temptation in the voice, more is good. : "I take away from you the Aralia, and then handed over to a person as you seem completely." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; resentment before? Mitt is also a dragon, even though his mother is a personal, a powerful and evil human, he has ambitions, and never feels that he will be humbler than Kelmen and Kelsey, the smallest brother, "Dragon tooth is never mine," he said frankly: "Everyone knows that there is only one real master of dragon tooth, that is you, my majesty, my master, my father, I am only fortunate to work for you - - I have to say that I can't make a dissatisfaction for something that has never existed before. That's ridiculous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So doubt?" New King encourages Said: "I know that you will have a lot of problems, let's talk, my dear Mitt, my son, I am in a good mood today, whatever questions you can ask, if you can answer, I will give you The answer, if not, I will not be angry, dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or hurt you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mite is hesitating, he really has a puzzled place. If the new king does not say so, he will never say it, even reveal it, but since the new king has come up, he thinks that if he can understand his father’s intentions more thoroughly, he may be able to complete it more perfectly. The task that the father delivered...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new king waited quietly, he was always very tolerant of his eldest son, just like the recent return To the nephew around him, as for Kelmen and Kelsey, he is not like their father, they are not like his children, but since they are proud of the children of the red dragon, let them go Sometimes, the new king will laugh because of their childishness. For many years, a mortal family can continue to breed for ten generations or more, and they are still blindly pursuing the tail of the red dragon mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows better than the new king. Red dragons are extremely selfish creatures. They do everything for themselves, for them. Even the descendants are enemies. The reason why Grei will allow children to build nests around their own, is just to use their power - this is still based on the fact that they are powerful and terrible dragons. As for the dragons, isn’t there enough Grenada now? ? Why is Greddy so fond of Austal? It is because this dragon has shown a different ability to bring her inexhaustible gold coins and intelligence. Otherwise, is it because Austal has a beautiful face? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he thought he was going to get the eldest son’s response, Mittitch shook his back with vigilance and put his hand on his dagger. on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is it?" It seems that another opportunity has to be found, and the new king is awkwardly hitting the arm of the chair with his fingers. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
