Let the lich go to worry about this thing, no, the soul of the outside world thinks, he may be happy, it is a bit curious, but this curiosity is not enough to let it try to share the bed with a succubus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I can't wait, my master," said the succubus, her sharp little teeth rubbing against the agitated blood vessels: "I have already waited for you." It’s been a long time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-But before she didn’t let her go hungry, the Lich said she seemed to have found a very good victim, of course There may be many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it?" Under the hint of the Lich, the soul of the outside world asked: "Your other lover, I smelled his smell." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you in a hurry?" Ferry Hill said: "I am very happy that you will be jealous for me, or you are just worried about whether I am ruined. "Your plan," she shook her head. "So the Master is always not very cute, because they always consider this and think about it. There is not much time left for us and ourselves, but you can feel at ease, cute, lucky. It is neither your subordinate nor your friend, but your enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-haired dragon has raised an eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that your message is not so well-informed," the succubus's tail gently smacked his calf and evacuated from there, Ferry Kehir walked gracefully around the soul of the outside world. "Your brother may be having a headache for his first team leader."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You killed him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A stubborn guy," said Felix Hill. "But it's not that hard."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Hey, I think you should thank her once, the Lich said that she did a good job, I just suspect that she has fallen in love with you - remember me Have you said anything about the components of the Dragon Tooth Legion? The first team leader is the commander's tongue and arm. The other team leaders are looking at him. When the commander can't lead them personally, he can be said to be the strongest of the Dragon Legion, and the man whom the commander believes most can believe. His life and honor are closely linked to the commander - in order to let them retreat and betray, we may have to pay a heavy price that is unimaginable, but now, let us not let Mittitch notice us. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——But Mitt should know that we summoned Ferry Hill...dudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Evidence, evidence, evidence, I believe that Ferry Hill will handle it perfectly. And he is still our brother. He should love us and believe in us, not unwarranted suspicion, which is not suitable for his long-standing image and the laws of Grenada. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world shook his head. He guessed that what Ferry Hill wanted was this. She handled a tricky trouble for them for free. But obviously, she is not prepared to put the whole process out, this may be left to her next dawn, after she is full - but not. At least the soul of the opposite world does not, anyway, it has a lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——How was the first team leader selected? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Selected in the first detachment, the lich answers, he also knows that this is only a unique soul of the outside world, the way to escape the childish, but He also doesn't want a fool who hasn't tasted it and loves it to appease a succubus. It will ruin everything, irritate a succubus, and irritate Graz's daughter. She has already shown her strength, and Mitt's first guard is not so easy to crown this title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--They will do whatever they can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- That is certain, obituary, trap, assassination, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Then he will bear the brunt, maybe the next day he will die silently in his bed. I know that Mittite spent a lot of thought on the dragon, that is, he did not want him to easily lose in the internal struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does my invitation make you so embarrassed?" Ferry Hill interrupted the conversation in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing to give in to your body and wisdom, <!--the middle of the desktop content 2--><br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;style="display:inline-block;width:336px;height:280px"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The soul of the alien world follows the instructions of the Lich Says: "But I used almost all the spells before I came back... The desert is full of danger, and I brought it back." He used his eyes to signal that Ferry Hill went to see the huge black figure. . "In order to make him fall, I almost died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" said Felix Hill, her fingers swaying, and the robes were on the robes. A tight row of small buttons, one after the other, loosened, revealing the long underwear tied with a tie, she pulled them with the tip of her tongue, and then watched for a long time the traces left on the dragon's chest - those The scars leave traces even after the treatment of the potion, and these traces may not disappear until the next day, indicating that they are indeed very serious. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should let me treat you for it." The succubus said that the devil also has a way to treat others, the simplest is from others The body extracts magical energy into the body they care about, not just spells. They also create weapons with the same effect. Once a famous thief had such a dagger, he gained a long time for non-human creatures. The vitality, which made him live for a long time and young, and finally he did not know what to end. Some people said that he had followed the dagger to the endless abyss, where he directly became a terrible demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it's your spell," the soul of the alien world said: "So I think it's used elsewhere."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem is that you can't do it today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We still have a lot of time," said the soul of the opposite world. I feel that my cheeks are numb: "Unless you are tired of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferke Hill laughed, the skin different from ordinary people was shocked by fierce It's like hiding a volcano that is about to erupt, and the breath she blows in the air is like a sulphur steam flowing in the air before the volcanic eruption. "Okay," said the succubus, "but remember, you promise I have to compensate me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One million sorry," said the soul of the opposite world: "Please forgive my weakness, I don't want to let you down." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You won't let me down, in fact," said Ferry Hill: "I have never seen a life like you, your body. Hidden Secrets and contradictions, I hope that one day I can pull them out one by one with my own fingers to see if they are as bloody and luscious as I imagined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————————————————————————————————— —————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferke Hill falls in the courtyard without regret As soon as she appeared, other human beings could not continue to stay here. Keou lazily glanced at her and turned her head to lick her own messy fur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the mount of Kremar?" asked the succubus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you change another person, Keou will definitely growl and shout: We are companions, partners, friends, etc., but since this is Succubus - um, "Yes," he said with a squint: "Yes, Kreima is my master, I am his mount baby."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he expected, Ferry Hill walked away with a scorn. Keou breathed a sigh of relief behind her. Fortunately, he heard some bad things about the succubus from the bard. They have almost no picky for men, but there are also kinds of dishes that are not theirs. - It is like Keou at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will be laughed at by all the lions and beasts who know this thing for more than 100 years, but compared with the succubus and the egg, this treatment has become extremely beautiful and rare - Ke Oke does not want to look A succubus uses his own children to cook eggs, omelettes and egg rolls every morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Tooth Legion soon became a clue, this time, in addition to the gift, Crema New guest guests are also welcome in the mansion. They are the captains of the Dragon Tooth Legion. They promise to give loyalty to Kremar, provided that Kremar can designate them to be the first team leader. - Of course, the first team leader should choose from the first team, but now the commander of the dragon tooth is Kreima instead of Mitt, if the first team leader of Mitt is not suddenly dead, then 慑Because of his cruelty and strength, the other team leaders can only bury their ambitions in the deepest part of their hearts, but he is already dead, and there is no one in the first squad that is worthy of their fear of retreating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This important transaction is certainly not possible to negotiate overnight, but when the fourth detachment left, it seems that the situation of the desert barbarian was unintentionally raised. "The worms seem to smell the smell in the air," he said. "They are scattered and divided, what information do you have about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I once had a secret agreement with one of them," the soul of the outside world said calmly. "The shellac and venom of the eater are still of some value. Before we bury them all in the sand, I want to see me. Can I get some slaves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth squad leader smiled. "I also feel a little pity, Your Highness," he said. "Your thoughts are very correct. If possible, I am willing to serve you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the soul of the opposite world said: "No, my knight, don't need that much trouble, we only I need to wait. If he has such a little wisdom, he will come to me on my own feet. "There was no doubt," he said, "no doubt," he bowed. "I believe you will get what you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it is because of this "blessing", the night of the night, the whale wax candle beside the soul of the alien world jumped out of a flame, the flame fell to the ground, illuminate The surrounding walls, but not meant to be extinguished at all. Then from the flame, Musa's face was revealed. He looked at Kremar. His eyes were full of horror, resentment, and inevitable despair. If there is anything, it is very strange, there is still some hope and pray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came to see you," he looked exhausted, his hair was unkempt, and the clothes tied up on his shoulders showed blood stains: "You, you, Your Highness, Do you still need us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You talked to your family," the soul of the alien world can almost say something ruthlessly: "How is the result? ?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are not willing to migrate. Moussa said: "They think that I was deceived by you." Although he put all the information he could get in front of the elders, they still didn't believe it. They even accused Moussa because they were timid. Small and want to sell the tribe to the Grenada, he wants to be a slave, but they don't want to, most of the people in the family are cursing him, others just think that he is alarmist, (www.uukansuom nonsense) Moussa recalled the situation at the rally and felt a burst of heart-wrenching pain - no one knew that he had been paying close attention to the grid. The changes of the three legions of Rinada have also been looking for another desert. The desert barbarian often claims to be a poisonous insect in the desert. This is a kind of pride, but who will allow a group of poisonous insects around? Elders And his elders believe that even if the Grenada people once again dispatched the army to encircle them, the result will only be the same as before. They can take the eater and take the wind like a wind, no one can find them. Trace They can survive by eating the honey and secretions of the spider beasts, while the big birds and the dragons are going to eat meat. The Greinada people can't find them in the desert for a long time, and in the end they can only do nothing. Going home - as Moussa said, the masters and warlocks of Grenada can control the sandstorm, they are even less convinced, the barbarian survives in the desert for a longer time than the Grenada, who can Manipulating sandstorms, are they gods? Even if the gods are not possible, the sandstorms have never been arbitrary, and their appearance and disappearance have no sign, even if they are moving, they will suddenly change direction. And if Grenada People can really do this, why do they let their caravans be swallowed up by sandstorms again and again?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
