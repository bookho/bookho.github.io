			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caubert and the guests from the mainland have found it a bit difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We said earlier that Longhuo Island is a small but closed world, although merchants are always rushing, but not everyone can get deals with them. Opportunities and status – the eunuchs who deal with the lords’ dealings have been cautiously horrible, and because the goods they trade contain humans and human slaves, their choices are even narrower. After all, not everyone knows how to get a slave (sometimes according to the requirements of the eunuchs, such as young and strong men and women, beautiful young children, a bard, a thief or a The orcs are able to transport them safely to the Dragon Fire Island. In any case, the distance between the Beitburg and the Longhuo Islands is not so far away, and the slave trade is legal in the Longhuo Islands. Bibi Dyke is not, merchants can not follow the usual chart, because the routes indicated by the sea are usually through the seas owned by Beitburg, each with the dragon Islands lord or lord wants to deal with businessmen must be another way to get a chart or sailing at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are only a few people who can interact with the eunuchs of Longhuo Island. They have their own business group, have designated ports, and are in the dragon. The Fire Island has built huge houses, and several of them have even been given certain rights by the eunuchs—they can take the “tobacco” out and mix them in the food of the slaves to let them eat, so fresh” Once the cattle and horses were transported to Longhuo Island, they could immediately invest in the hard work. For example, the tourists who sent Yadel to the side island can only say that they occasionally try their luck. They are It’s not the ability to get the goods you want, but the eunuchs who control the port are satisfied with the gifts they send. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the East Crown retired the army and the eunuch after giving the side island to Kremar, so the three ports can be said to be in a group of dragons without heads. State, if Cobbert is a big businessman in the above, of course, you can find the port and the berth without thinking, but we know that he is a believer in Su Lun. I have never been afraid to inform Bibi Tibao of the movement of the slave ship, so he appears here, and it is already very lucky to be killed by people who have been consistently hostile to them, but if his ship wants to enter the port ◎style_txt; Almost impossible, not to mention that he also carried two hundred fully armed fighters. If it wasn’t for the Fort Lauder’s mage, Gavin’s decisive decision, he seized a major hostage from the crowd – a business owner. The son - he climbed out of a sly's arms and wanted to see the excitement, so he got a chance to negotiate. They probably stupidly swayed in the neighboring waters of the side island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Cooper also promised a full three-beet beet sugar on behalf of Kreima as a reward for business people. Originally he also wanted to bargain. See if you can get one or two guides from the merchants. This request was just rejected by the merchants. They claimed that their refusal was not caused by guard or anger, but they did not have the qualification to enter. To the hinterland of the side island - where it belongs to the lord, anyone who enters the land without permission will be cut off and exposed to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their words are not sincere, more perfunctory and shoving, but Cobbert has no time to temper with them, and they are not coming with businessmen. Mercenary mercenaries fighting - If the spellcasting materials are available, Master Gavin can try to summon a wandering soul to ask where Cramerar is now. But he just missed an important gemstone powder. When Gavin wanted to force it, he was stopped by Cobbert. He and Alvara were friends for many years, and it was clear about the consequences of the failure of the spell. They really don't need too many surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caubert tried to pray to the moon goddess Su Lun, although he is not a pastor, but his loyalty and love for the goddess is unquestionable - he does not Know if the sound passing over the ear is a response from the goddess, but without guidance and magic. They still walked in the direction of the voice. They were still uneasy when they passed through the jungle. They were relieved when they saw the sugarcane field and the sugar beet. The Norman soldiers in the Highlands went up to ask the slaves who were busy harvesting sugar cane and cooking beets to ask if there were people they were not familiar with. They had to say that as a soldier, they were quite polite, but the slaves could not. It’s polite, at least in their opinion, the slaves can even be rude – they keep working all the time, even one eye and one syllable are paying, and the soldiers are violently caught for it. I lived in one of them and dragged him away from the beet to make them stunned. Even if the soldiers took away his tools (which were actually woody), he was constantly and mechanically waving his arms like It was the air that was filled with the beets he had been serving, and the other slaves just continued to work for the beet, and their companions and soldiers failed to attract their attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people they meet next are all the horrible appearance of this curse, even the soldiers who can face the tens of thousands of orcs Unconsciously a little cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on?" Cavalier asked: "Is it magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably, but it is said to be a drug." Cobbert said: "They will make the slaves very docile, but I am also seeing for the first time... such a person..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repaired his thick brows. Like most Normans in the Highlands, he had eyelids and eyebrows close together, his eyebrows were prominent, his eye sockets were deep, and the eyebrows covering the brow bones naturally formed above the eyes. A deep shadow: "Krimal... The Master may not be suitable for this place." The soldiers and residents of Thunder Castle know that the black-haired wizard is a sweet person outside the battle. He will not only use the spell. Change the flames of the man running around to make the children happy, and cast a rough and tasteless wheat porridge to be as sweet as honey, or let the snow and ice bloom in the girl's hair As long as you ask for it, and he has time and leisure, he is always willing to satisfy anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if they used to be the master of the lord and the lord Bydwin, they would not make them feel more violating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe." Cobbert said: "But his mentor is the son of the lord of this place. His disciples are the first ones when the mentor has no children. An heir, there is such a law in every place, including the Longhuo Islands. What's more for you. This thing can be said to be profitable and harmless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same is true for Betty Dyke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caubert smiled so unexpectedly at Longhuo Island A nail in the middle is of course something that Alvara and the governor of Bitumburg are willing to see. Otherwise, how can there be so many weapons on his ship? Only in preparation for them, Alva thought that they had to recruit some mercenaries who used these weapons for Kremar. What they did not expect was that the god of destiny would be so ignorant of the young black hair caster - nearly three Thousands of experienced and blood-stained soldiers, if not their sensitive identity and amazing numbers, have probably been intercepted by a lord or king, and now they all belong to Kreima. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caubert even felt that he should try to thank Dylan Don Cray, who is thousands of miles away. It should be called this name, he probably will never know what he has lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but let the captain of the "Little Bird" worry and even anxious that they haven’t found Cremaar, what shouldn’t happen if they arrived It’s already happening. The older Ranger can be sure that it will be a tragic joke that has never been seen before. They have gone through half a dozen sugar cane fields and beet fields, but all they have met are slaves. The appearance of Dada is almost Like the gift of Su Lun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will take you to my master." Dada said, then quickly turned to give orders to slaves who were always behind him: "You stay here." He said, they don't need to be tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing these slaves, they gave them a look. "Shantou" and other slaves have always maintained a salute, no matter which part of the body has ever surpassed the soldiers' knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slave who was stripped of hair and beard (oh, maybe he didn’t have it) took Chapel and Highland Norman soldiers through the palm forest They no longer need guidance because they have seen the light of magic and torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the spell, three slender snakes spit out of her mouth, their tails sticking to her tongue, and they felt everything could be transferred from the body of the snake to the senses of Reyote - the snake in the air A groaning sound, the constantly elongating body twitching wildly. Like a whip like a whip - a living whip, the golden eyes flashed the same cold and evil as the female warlock, and the pink tongue spit into the air. Two teeth containing venom shine like a pearl in the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rushed to the black-spotcaster, but the serpent's tiny teeth couldn't bite through the white robe on his body, and the attacked caster was ready. The next spell is prepared, but the female warlock in the red robe does not seem to be frightened. She spins her body and reveals a distorted smile while avoiding the spell. The soul of the outside world hears the warning of the Lich. However, it is too late, Ruiyite has already changed her target. The life she wants to capture is not Kremar but stands on the side of the Master, holding a longbow double knife, blocking the swords of the pirates for the Master. Dagger's Elf Ranger Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry is aware of the invasion of the viper, he sneaks agilely, but the snake directly passes the fangs that are folded out when there is no possibility of biting him. Spraying venom on him, the venom fell on the cheeks and eyes of the elf, and immediately a terrible cyan smog appeared. The skin suddenly burst into a blood-red foam and began to fester and swell. Plum was rushed up and ready. The healing was thrown on Kerry itself, but the healing effect was not that great, and at the moment the Ranger was hit by the venom, there were pirates cheering loudly, and they couldn’t wait to rush. Want to catch or kill the elf that made them lose a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crumar's spell immediately turned to the pirate and Kerry Ben, the dark spherical cyclone fell into the pirate group, throwing them high, some fell into the sea, while others fell Their companions are on the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the spirit of Reyant arrived immediately, it hit the black hair caster, if not the white robe from Tyre Perhaps this will completely destroy the half body of Kremar. Perhaps it was such a moment that the situation on the battlefield suddenly changed. First, the toxins on the wound hit by Leona that were hit by the arrow finally extended to her arm. Her hammer fell on the sand, the sea magic Even Bianwen knocked on Baldwin's shoulder and lost an arm. He couldn't take care of this. Birdwin shouted loudly. He rushed to Leona and grabbed her to get rid of the scope of several pirate swords. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sea Devil paused for a moment, out of the orc’s greed, she was not in a hurry to chase Leona and Birdwin, but to pick it up first. Leona's hammer, as she imagined, engraved in the hammer, mysterious and delicate patterns and runes attached magic to the heavy weapon, so that the hammer that should have weighed about a hundred pounds became like The toy wooden hammer is as light as it is, but it doesn't make people feel too light and can't find the center of gravity. In addition, the sea magic does not feel relaxed when accepting its beating. She cracked openly and screamed at the mouth and smiled with satisfaction. I hang my hammer in my waist. The spoils are still collected as early as possible. She said to herself that even the Seahawk’s crew would risk being turned into a dinner by the sea magic when they encountered a considerable trophy. Danger is privately hidden, let alone the crew of the Golden Lady is now mixed with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come a favor." Drake, who will become quite sharp at this time, yelled: "Do you think that a hammer can be better than a hammer? Is the reward more valuable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can be said." Haimo said, she ordered her crew to continue besieging Liona and Birdwin because It's best to let them live. The pirates' offenses have become like cats and mice. They brought in fishing nets, which is the best equipment to capture the live. Drake is not so willing to ask for help from the sea monster. The problem is that Gülen is obviously a thief who is extremely good at assassination, hiding and running. His people can’t say nothing. Few can not form a threatening noose again, Drake understands Gülen, this thief is not the kind of good-hearted person, now Sea Devil and Ruiyite have already prevailed, he may abandon his companion at any time to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
