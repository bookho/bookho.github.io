			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the female lords of the hills and the white towers are in a frenzy, the successor of another broader, more fertile and important territory can almost say It is exactly the same thing that others seem to be unwise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should understand," after three kings, standing on the exquisite tapestry of the King of the Norman in the Highlands, the name of the ancestors, marking the surname, ten One of the owners of the Second Tower, who controls the finances of the largest country in the North, and his guild and merchants throughout the Big Six, Fukai Constance, sincerely said: "Respected Princess Leona, you used to be Norman The daughter of the king; now, you are the niece of King Norman, you are still the first heir to Norman in the Highlands, before your uncle can give you a cousin."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The women of Norman Norman have no inheritance rights." Leona flipped her own hunting knife and did not lift her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess’s little temper could not shake the barrier of Fukai compared to the suspicious predecessor and the unreasonable king. His sight fell. On the hunting knife, the fine gold hunting knife was given to the heir by the former king, inlaid with gold and ruby, but it is not the most precious place, its scabbard and handshake part are wrapped with the skin of the flame lizard, that Lizards are generally only visible in lava and volcanoes, and many times their caves, together with the caves of the red dragons, want to get them, both dangerous and difficult. Another is its blade, the light of gold is like moonlight, the elves The gift, "As long as you like," he said slyly: "The women of Highland Norman can get the inheritance rights. This is also your father's wish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Oona suddenly raised her head, her eyes were so sharp, and her expression was so cold: "Isn't that what you want to veto?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Fukai smiled a little, time seemed to never be in his body. Resident, he Bi Daian Princess more older, and Duke John the same year, but both have already revealed the signs of aging, has been bedridden. The weak Duke is not going to say him for a while, and Princess Ang Principal and any woman in the vulgar are obsessed with maintaining long-lasting youth and beauty, and she has the wealth and power that most men do not have. Even so, she Not so willing to stand side by side with Fukai. The Chancellor of the Treasury looks like the brother of his son Dylan Donkre. It’s not the rumors of the kings who are a few years old. About his age. There are several legends: Some people say that he got a magic needle that will keep him in his youth. He puts it on his shirt every day, where others can't see it; some people say that his master has summoned him to endless. The devil in the abyss, he made a deal with the devil; others said that because he inherited her blood from his mother, Fukai's mother is not a native. And she has always been ignorant of her family and surnames, which should have caused doubts, but what makes Wangdu people convinced is her extraordinary wealth and beauty, Fukai’s green eyes are brought by her, and she until Her husband, who was originally on the same appearance, did not have a decaying smell until she died. Her eyes were as bright as emeralds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you like," he said in a voice that could sway the heart of the stone: "There will be this law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fu Kai.Kang Steb..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to your instructions at any time." He bent down humbly and whispered: "As long as you are willing to give your order No, as long as your fiber points a little. We will satisfy all your wishes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Including Bardwin. Don Clay is innocent?" Oona pulled out the hunting knife, and the micro-light of the blade illumined her face that looked like a former king, a daunting face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, please don't mention that mean and dirty name." Fukai said unchanged: "That is insulting your identity..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have only one wish," Leona said. "Or can you let my father return to the world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the realm of the gods," Fukai said. There is a slight subtle dissatisfaction in the tone: "Although I am willing to satisfy your wishes, if you really want to forgive Baldwin, well, since you like it," he raised a hand and gestured to Leona. Don't interrupt his words: "Clarification of his sins can only be done by gods, but secular crimes can be washed with worldly rights and gold coins are very vulgar, but this is true, you can see and do As long as you become the ruler of Highland Norman, your scepter army and mouthpiece can help you do this. You will not be more difficult than folding a lilac flower. You can do whatever you want, even if it is You want to get married with Birdwin... It’s not impossible.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“So,” Li Ona said calmly: “ Where are you going to put my uncle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My dear friend John will be a good king," Fukai said bluntly: "But He is too weak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He had a ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fu Kai laughed: "No, in fact, he always suspects that this boy is not his blood, because his mother is He was born after being repatriated to her husband's residence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Dylan, is it not good to be the father of the king?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dylan is a caster," Fukai said: "A caster is not suitable. Be a ruler to get rid of the elves, but their king and the king of the common customs seem to be two different concepts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lie," Liona sharp Refutation: "As far as I know, there are more than two countries or regions ruled by the casters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't mention those red robes and gray robes, Fu Kai complained: "They don't call the country, that is, a group of mentors. Think about it. 30 percent of the people in a country are intensive in the caster and let me vomit." He sighed long: "In short, don't mention Dylan, I know him well, knowing what temper he is, he won't be the king of Norman in the Highlands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is the turn of Princess Leona’s turn: “Don’t you because you don’t want your only son to step into the trap you set?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp; "I am blunt," Fukai said softly. "I don't think that the throne of Norman in the Highlands will be a trap. Even if it is a trap, His Highness, there will be thousands of people who will not kill them." Parents and children are only trying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that is not me," Liona said: "I don't believe you, yes, Fukai. Kang Steb. My father believes in you, he once said to me, Fu Kai is a sly fox, but he is trustworthy, because you are Constable, he pointed to the tapestry and let me see your ancestors The surname, Constable, is one of the royal courts in the Norman language. You are loyal to the king and only loyal to the king until you. Fukai, you are not loyal to my father, but you are not Loyal to my uncle John, I don't know what you are thinking, because you seem to be more happy to see that this country is in chaos. I won't accept you, no matter how wonderful and correct your suggestions and ideas sound, I know that I Not a smart person, but I know at least one thing, that is . I will not be at your disposal "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; She paused. "I will also tell my uncle about this. Maybe he will blindly believe your lies like my father, or think that I am deliberate, but I will say that you can start thinking about how to explain."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fu Kai looked at her. Like seeing her for the first time, he finally sighed long: "Since you think so... I can only say that I am sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"You can leave, Fukai."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chancellor of the Treasury took a deep bow to Leona and stepped back two steps. Open the door and go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky outside is no longer bright, the princess's maid came in with a candlestick and served her to finish the grooming before going to bed. A strangely-looking maid presented a box to the princess. After the princess's personal maid opened, it was a gold comb inlaid with pearls. Norman Norman had no territorial waters, and only a few of the 6 lakes could occasionally find a small dim. The lake beads, like this, are big and round, and the lustrous sea pearls are expensive. "It’s the reward of the King’s Majesty,” the maid said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please express my gratitude to your majesty." Li Oona said that, in order to express his kindness, the new king sent every night since he was enthroned. A variety of fine jewelry, Leona did not know what to say about this behavior, but since she made the decision, I think this is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiters all left the room, and Leona quietly jumped out of bed and found a small fluorspar from under the pillow, which provided The light is only a candle, but it is enough. With the help of the princess, a black pocket is taken from the carved compartment on the bed side. The bag is not as small as she expected, but it can hold two What the horse could shake, Leona dumped the things inside on the bed and almost drowned her entire land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food drinking clothing, armor weapons, etc., as well as gold coins, if necessary, can replace the gems used by gold coins; Mithril gold ornaments and weapons in the last part of life On the top, the Norman of Norman in the Highlands really cares about Leona; the magic wand, the scroll and the rune, the first two can only be used by the caster, but Leona remembers to help Birdwin escape from the king. The black young man is a mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sorted them up again, making sure that they didn’t leave anything that shouldn’t be left; then wrote a new king’s faint light The letter has practiced his promise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is her decision. She wants to leave the kingdom, leave Highland Norman, leave her home and her country, but she will come back one day, Together with Baldwin, he joined hands again in the sunshine cloves and cheers of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are going south," said Kerry Ben. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave Highland Norman first." Elf Ranger Open the map, this is a map that can't help the thieves in the heart to see what the elves want to do. At the very least, the outline and size of the Yar Island familiar to the thieves must be more complete than the reserves in the guild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The silver crown jungle has been excluded," Mei Mei interjected: "How about Luzer’s grandfather? That is the guy worth 500,000 gold coins. His territory is also quite vast, and he has his own army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan squinted his lips: "That is a grandfather, little cute, He said: "A ruler, for these people, nothing can not be sold. If we go, he will greet us with ecstasy and give us the VIP treatment of the old king like Norman." Then look at the Highlands Norman would like to have a price that would satisfy him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin supported the thief’s claim without facing Penny or His thoughts were quite clear when he was old, "White Tower?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The White Tower may not be so peaceful recently," said Kerry Ben. Let's go to Bibi Dibao."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bibi Dibao..." Gülen repeated happily. When a thief like him enters the Bibi dike, he will be caught and hanged, and the thieves who are still able to hide themselves after repeated cleaning will not be happy. Many companions will be afraid of newcomers. The arrogant people caught the attention of the governor of the Betty Dyke, and called them to the disaster, for which they might preempt the outsiders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Betty Dyke is only temporary," said Kerry Ben. "We will eventually go to the Dragonfire Islands."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks at Crimall: "It’s also the home of your mentor’s hometown. The islands of the Dragonfire Islands are as dense as stars, and almost every island has a lord who has their own laws. With different beliefs, and far enough away from Norman Norman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds good." Gülen first said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
