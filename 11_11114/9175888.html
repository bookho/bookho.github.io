The texture is soft and there is no dripping smoke. After burning, only a white ash is left. The best is that the fire is quite hot. It takes only half an hour to warm my house of 100 cubic meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then put a gold hand stove into your arms, smoked all over the body, sit down in front of the huge black frame glass window, take out I have recently got an egg and clean it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This egg is about 25 cm high, and the surface is densely covered with the slender rice of the golden stem. The grain is a myriad of brilliant diamond particles, from the pigeon blood ruby The curved cross is traversing directly in front of it, under the cross, the elegant and beautiful Platinum of the Virgin Mary is grief-stricken to the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I almost hold my breath to clean it, and every time I touch it, I have to sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, I felt a little cold, carefully put down the eggs, stood up, prepared to add some fossils to the smoker, and then found the glass window. I actually set up a person before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to have been standing for a long time, and the vulgar headscarf piled up miniature snow mountains. The high brow bones, casting a sharp shadow, is not a feature of the locals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I opened the door and went out and greeted me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was shocked and explained quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to see, I want to see..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled softly Laughing, noticed that her sleeves have worn out plush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So come in and look at it, it's cold outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I opened the door and the 岫玉青鱼 immediately Lynn sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you came out, there was no noise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...you said this Are they snobbish? They will only make a noise when the guests come. I will ignore them when I come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my answer She couldn't help but smile. She sorted out her clothes and took the snow, and the lady walked into the store like a dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I entertained her to sit down across from me and asked her to drink my beloved spire tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, kind lady."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No thanks, you are my in-store guest It should be diligent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked around, and the face of the premature aging was bitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guest?...Miss..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please call me time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time...Miss...you are here, I am afraid that there is not one I bought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;I sat down and turned the gemstone egg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The tsar of the Romanov dynasty, what is the luxury and honor of Nicholas II, and the deep feelings of the queen Alexandra, live and beautiful The three women and two sons, who is not praised? But in the cold morning, he and his queen, and their prince and princess were gathered in the dark basement, one did not stay all killed by the gun... It’s raining, no one knows what will happen after a minute.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it yours, is this Faberge egg?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said lowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded with a smile, and took the direction of the cross sacred, and then clicked on the small wheat spikes protruding from the gemstone egg, and the eggshell slammed open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inner shell is studded with rice-sized round pink pearls, which rotates and sounds a bell, which is the simplest Easter melody melody, then shell Inside, he raised a crystal-clear jade egg. After the music was finished, it slowly opened like a flower. There was still a small and ivory sculpture hidden in it. The angel fluttered with the hands of the Virgin and thanked God, the believers. The resurrected Jesus embraced and slowly turned, and the music began again, "Jesus is coming." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her who is too surprised to control herself, I smile slightly . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the last work of Fabergé. On the eve of the Great Revolution, the king broke up the royal jewels he owned, and asked Faberge to use them to make this egg. When the Great Revolution broke out, Faberge’s property was confiscated, and I was in exile in Switzerland. He worked hard for three years and finally completed his commitment to Nicholas II.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I close the gemstone egg a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was silent for a long time before she started talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a little daughter who is only 5 years old. She didn't go to school this morning because the school is holding a 'Looking for Eggs' event today, and each person needs to pay $8. If I let her go, then we have no bread to eat for a whole week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened quietly to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She doesn't know why some children can have a lot of chocolate, ceramics, metal, and even beautiful eggs with gold inlays and gemstones, but she even I don’t have a plastic egg... I don’t understand... I work hard day and night to help people clean, wash clothes, and move goods, but the money I get is never enough for my daughter’s rent and meals...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her fingers grabbed the surface of the Louis XIV-style writing desk, and the blunt and flat nails made a faint white mark on the hard mahogany, and the sound was low and hoarse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I named her Victoria, the name of the princess, but she can only eat fish, dry bread, live with thieves and prostitutes... God, we have rotted here, why my daughter will continue this poor life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can't you be as comfortable as others? "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anything in the status quo? No, Miss Time, I hope my daughter can be a little princess, just like the white horse carriage parade in those festivals Like the little princess, waving with a diamond smile... even a minute, a half minute!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oak bell on the wall is ringing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to be suddenly awakened and stood up awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry... I should go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said in front of a stranger Many of these words made her embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This gemstone egg, I will keep it for you for 90 days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss time, what are you kidding?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New York’s heavy snow stopped for seven days, and the dark economy The Great Depression still enveloped the entire United States. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep my promise and kept the gemstone for 88 days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jadeite in front of the door eagerly rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked in with a child. There are still a few young gentlemen behind him. One of the gentlemen is especially expensive, but his face is pale, his eyes are vaguely indignant, and he does not live to see other people, apparently under coercion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been coming to me, Gray's eyes are staring at me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss time, you said you can keep it for 90 days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took out the gemstone egg and put it on the little one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people are amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She brought the child in her arms close to the egg, and the cold touch made the groggy child open his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue eyes, the pure gold curls, are indeed children like angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child looked at the egg and had a naive smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mummy... Mommy, is this the egg you said to me? Oh, it’s beautiful, than Wendy’s, no, than Sydney. The egg of Asia is beautiful, and it is more beautiful than any egg I have ever seen. It must be the egg of the princess..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded to me . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will open the agency intentionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, layers of gems reflect the pale face of the child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Child is alive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman who came under pressure could not help but blurt out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I bought it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She insisted that she ignored the person behind her The pale face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I use a check."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took out a signed name from her pocket Blank check, fill in the number I submitted (naturally expensive) and hand it to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You call the bank to cash it now, Miss Time, thank you for keeping this egg for me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone behind her, who took the hat down, took the time to hand in the business card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took a look at the name on the business card, and then looked at the faces of those people, how obvious they came from the same place - the business card does not belong The young man in front of me, it comes from a "good guy" who is unknown to everyone. He is hidden in the darkness, like an octopus, reaching out in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the gentleman who is passionate about helping his fellow countrymen, a poor woman with only hands and faith, I’m afraid I won’t get this kind of “justice”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe in you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I flipped the check and the business card all over and placed it in the heart Wooden writing desk drawers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mummy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mummy... Mommy, I... can I touch it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course. It's yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked up the jewel egg and stuffed it into her daughter's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child’s slender little hand clasped tightly, his cheeks rubbed, the blood-slip lips kissed the egg, and the over-excited action made the coat on the child’s body Falling down,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrible broken body is impressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skin that the child is exposed to is as clean as snow, but still emits a disgusting smell, not because of blood or carrion - the person who will die must have this A smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately wraps her clothes back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mummy, have you really bought it for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes It belongs to you. It is your egg."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She replied affirmatively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin golden beams are cast between the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Easter Egg is a shining light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child at this time is a little princess who is extremely beautiful and extremely proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although only a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child’s smile has a twist. This strange expression is left on her little face, her hand is hanging down weakly, and the egg falls on the table. A crisp sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young gentleman came forward to hold the child's wrist and shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quietly held the child tight and asked me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss time, can you lend me a hammer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took a solid copper hammer on the back shelf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a look at the fine pattern on the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are all precious things here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I owe my debt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This property is a gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thanked her, then waved her hammer and licked the egg that was still open! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fine ivory statue, the emerald egg is turned into pieces in seconds, and the pink pearls on the inner shell are scattered everywhere, hidden in it. The machine was torn and destroyed, and the thin platinum shell was distorted by the strong external force, and the golden wheat silk was peeled off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She used all her strength to beat, break, and destroy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the little prototype of this precious rare gemstone egg no longer exists in this world, she slowly puts down the hammer and holds it again and never The child who will wake up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahead the head, the queen, out of my store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(End)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;———————————————— ———————————————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Water ghost<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; year after year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
