Hey, this name is not in the Grenadine. What is full of warm blessings, it has heard of some things, it is obvious that both its mortal master and the warlock are in great trouble.However, when Asmodeos was left by Gülen, it did not have any nostalgia. Now the Jianjian Port is in a strange calm. The little devil has nothing but to fight the flies with his tail. Can't do itIn addition to this, there is a pair of lovers who are sweet to the little devil. To be honest, the inhabitants of the bottomless abyss are not optimistic about their future. It has countless times to think about laughing at them when the disaster comes, but Aspen Modeos always felt that if he continued to be with them, it might have to find a needle-snake to give it a pair of Mithril eyes or fine gold eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wild cat, perhaps a wild cat, has too many deformed creatures in Grenada, sometimes they are created by warlocks to clean up the remaining small goblins Eat it, but sometimes, like now, the little devil is in front of a black-gray striped cat with two heads, one head forward and one head backwards, so that they can see both directions at the same time. Something, then its ribs position also extended a few tentacles, which can be firmly fixed to the beam together with the claws, perhaps for this reason it was not caught - it curved the back, two heads At the same time, the intimidating whistling sound, the little devil stepped back two steps, hiding himself better, the deformed poor worm mistakenly thought that his threat had worked, and its tentacles were pulled out from the surface of the decaying greasy wooden beams. Dancing slowly in the air - the little devil knows that they are not slow at all, it has seen how they huntPerhaps he was mistaken for a fat house mouse, Asmodeos thought, it continued to step back, the cat was tempted to take a step forward, another step, did not notice that it had From the shadow of the beam to the place where there is light<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A smashing arrow passes through the air without warning, and then the deformed raccoon cat is nailed to the beam, it turns to the side at the last moment, but Still not able to get it, the arrow did not hit its heart and head but it brought more pain to it. Its bright eyes looked at the void, as if it could find its final destination there, and the little devil has been jealous. Where is the slumber of its despair, or the sorcerer of a affair that gives the cat extra wisdom, or simply fills a furry body with a human soul, anyway, it has Humanity makes its taste rich and diverseDudu1();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenary who shot the arrow took the bet from his companion, it was just a silver coin, but the winner was proud, and the loser The face is not happy - the cat is no one to care, including the owner of the pub, it will rot quietly on the wooden beams, the decayed fur and mites will fall from the beams on the people's glasses, but that It doesn't matter, maybe it can add a strange flavor to their blood wine – this pub is dirty and cheap but cheap, but people who are in this category can't take care of these little things, the little devil gently gasps , blowing your breath into the air<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fine dust falls on the mercenaries’ wine glasses, on the plates, with their hair and beards, and falls with their movements Their faces were then inhaled by the nose or unconsciously involved in the tongue. They didn't notice that there were so many people drunk today. No, maybe the pub owner noticed, but his reaction was to beat the wine. The slave of the water - because he did not work well, and was busy mixing more water into the wine. In the end, the transparent liquid was not so much water as the wine, he tasted the first floor, then he was full of Suspiciously fell down<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only income of the mercenaries is the occasional charity of the knights, and the search for some valuable things from the feces of the Deinonychus. After all, in the battle, the Deinonychus will eat some people, and they will not take those people in advance. The jewellery and money sacks on the body are solved - there is also the availability of cheap drinks and food, they often gather together to discuss how to get the green eyes of a dragon claw knight, the dragon claws are also from the battle, in some battles In the meantime, these shackles will appear as auxiliary forces to clean up the battlefield, and they will undoubtedly get much more than cleaning the Daggers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil uses his tail to smack a small blood-sucking worm that gathers on the side of the cat. The Dragon Legion has an unusually harsh law, and the harshest servants will be careful to close their mouths, but this is a powder from the bottomless abyss. This dust collected at the foot of the Devil will Tempting people to lose their minds and become crazy... They began to talk nonsensely, arbitrarily venting their depression and dissatisfaction, vying to tell every secret they know - these secrets are hidden in their hearts I hope that I can exchange some considerable benefits for myself in the near future - they remember this firmly, even the softest arms or the fiercest spirits may not be able to reveal them, but now They said desperately, shouting, as if they had no longer had no chance to wave their tongue. The little devil listens intently in the dark, and many people will ignore these dregs, but this is not the case. Because these bugs are ubiquitous, they obviously know more than the average person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of this information is wrong, some of it is half-truth, and some of it is real, it’s fake, but these don’t need Asmo Deos thinks, it just needs to bring them back. Dudu2();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Asmodeos returned to the short-term owner, he was ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My honourable master," the little devil hurriedly shouted: "Where you want to go, please bring me, please believe me, I can give You have a lot of help, a lot, I swear, in the name of the bottomless abyss, you will need me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outside world looks at the transpiration of the air The scenes seen through them are twisted and distorted, and the little devil's hairy body seems to ignite at any time. Although it knows that this is impossible, it is absolutely impossible to bring any devil, demon, today's itinerary. Or someone standing in the evil camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at who is talking," unexpectedly, it was Ferry Hill that solved this little trouble for him. The succubus leaned on the cold stone pillar. On the top, only one hand stretched out, ignoring the distance of several tens of feet and grasping Asmodeos, who was flapping his wings with excitement, the dazzling sunlight of the outside made her frown - the devil and the devil are not afraid of the sun, but this kind of The ultimate light is really not what they like. She nodded to Kremar and casually kneaded Asmodeos: "Ah," she said scornfully. "It turned out to be just a little devil." - How? What made you think you could share with me or even grab the owner? Or you should come to see my teeth and throat," said the female demon. "Maybe they will make you smarter." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I swear I have no intention!" Asmodeos screamed, thinking that it could cause the attention of Cremal, but it When I tried my best to find my head from the palm of Ferry Hill’s palm, I was hurt. To find that its owner would have disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freak Hill certainly won’t really swallow Asmodeos, she knows that this little devil has a little bit for Kremar Useful, but this does not prevent her from cramming the little devil into a glass bottle. Asmodeos is frustrated in all senses - it also thinks that he can get a rich reward. As a result, it can only huddle in a glass bottle and watch a demon licking, eating the stewed keel from the tail of the dragon, then eating the fried dragon scales from the stewed keel, and eating the dragon blood pudding from the fried dragon scales. You can also chew one or two soul gems as a dessert. Dudu3();<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She still so brazenly asked Asmodeos to hand over the information it got, the little devil was silent, but he The enemy, Felix Hill, will never care about this, and she is also willing to play some interesting games after the lame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil’s scream can almost pierce the sky, if not able to get the permission of Ferry Hill - anyway, it poured out all without a pause Something, when it was discovered that this succubus seemed more like an assassin, her understanding of torture was a little deeper than her understanding of men, but it really confuses why Ferry Hill knows this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
