			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author's words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very sorry, I was led by a leader, I just came back today, tired Again... apologize again! ! ! Now I can only send a chapter first, and there is still a chapter in the evening. After that, there will be three or four consecutive days to make up for it. WwW.XsHuotXT.com<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and: There are a lot of adults who misunderstand the book review. Kerry’s moral bottom line is very high, and it’s not going to take Crimdale. Don't pay attention to the sac and the pockets - the epoch bag can't be turned over at all. The wizard usually attaches spells to it. The genie is sensitive to magic. It becomes faster and stronger than the human being, but Kerry is not a mage. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write a short explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This is not a good habit, the Lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I mean, just like the thing you are doing now, the former undead said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the outer world sits on the ground with his feet on the floor. The floor of the "empty house" is covered with large whale skins, which will not be eroded by water vapor. Rotten, smooth and elastic, whale skin is black, so the things placed on it become more conspicuous - crystal, fluorite, candles, pearls, bird feathers, fine sand, rose petals, Mercury, silver, gold and ruby, rice, sulfur, various blood and skin in small bottles, meat, etc... and so on... Habit, it likes to take everything out, sort it, count it, then put it back in the same way, instead of sorting it directly in a drawer or a box – just like a naughty child playing and showing off him. Secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If you happen to have a caster around you, the Lich explains, then you can guess the spell you want to remember by looking at the spellcasting material you prepared. Even if you can't, you can find out what you can remember but not what you remember; if not, then as long as his memory is still able to pass, and he has a tongue that can speak and a hand that can write, then his threat to you is only Smaller than the former - they are your cards, you can't always open them so clearly for everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- That is Kerry Ben, the soul of the outside world does not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The lich gives a sharp sneer – I really want to see how you eat at a certain moment. He said as if he was talking to himself, if it weren't for me, this shackle, I would laugh when you were crossed by Kerry's arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The soul of the alien world is silent, he can't even refute the words of the lich. Because he is very clear, the most abhorrent of the elves who believe in the god of life, Angris, is the gray robes that play life and soul on the palm of the hand. The lich is even worse. They are the natural enemies that never compromise. If it is exposed to the identity of the lich, Kerry would never be hesitant... the elves never fear death. I don't think that death is a punishment and torture, maybe not, but who knows, anyway, it shouldn't be a mixed ball in the world of the living. In the concept of the Elf Ranger, this is not a betrayal, but a difficult but Kindness and good deeds - his arrows will shoot through their bodies, freeing the souls of the imprisonment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that whether it is a lich or an outside world The soul does not want to face this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Do you have any questions? The lich said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——I am only wondering why your reminder will come so late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I need to make the suspicious elf see that we don’t have the damn dragon grammar book in hand, the lich is awkward. That dragon grammar book may make any warlock or even a wizard with a dragon's blood ecstatic, but for him now it can only be said that it is a pity of food and tastelessness - half of his time is It belongs to a thief from another plane. For some mysterious reason, it will be affected by the blood but cannot read the dragon correctly. Maybe the Lich will guide him to learn the dragon language and other languages ​​in the future. Sexually, it can't be interpreted as a proper thing. What's more, the undead has captured the true mystery of this spell book, not the spells copied inside, not the runes on the cover - those baits that are only placed on the bright surface, the casters probably only pay attention Both. Instead of the caster taking up the pure gold and gems that are decorated on the cover of the book, probably no one will immediately notice the black gap between the pure gold characters, such as the lich. If it is the previous lich, it may not Noticed, but he saw a lot of things in the broken memories of outsiders. There is something called a QR code that, after being scanned and parsed, becomes any kind of message you want to express. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a few nights, the Lich cracked the mystery, although it was only a part, but this spell book was of no use to him. And there is a secret person who can hire and hide the little devil Asmodeos. Asmodeos was once the devil of the undead, and his ability and appetite are well known. It is not a good guy to deal with, except that it is only powerful except the high-level devil. The caster, so the Lich from the good deeds let the little devil "steal" away his pocket to clean up the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course he will not let people other than himself know about it, especially sharing another body with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It’s my fault, the lich replied with sarcasm and indifference, because I didn’t expect anyone to be slow to this point, we also have a section with Kerry’s Time is up, you didn't find out that he would consciously stay in the tent or room until the last two days? The dragons are all evil, and there is a Fenway in the former Grey Ridge. He can't be vigilant and prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer suddenly closed his mouth, and the soul of the outside world stunned his hand and took the remaining casting material into the pocket, leaving only a small piece in the palm of his hand. gum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"empty house" is like a ball that has been cut off at the bottom, perhaps because of the creation of the spell, it has only two sizes, one has a bottom Ten steps wide and ten steps long, single accommodation, and the other is chosen by the adventurers, twenty steps and twenty steps wide, with a low edge in the middle of the sleeping area, the height is only human male The waist is only six feet in length. The top is hung on the dragon fire island. The large-leaf banana woven mat can cover the sight of both sides. Of course, it is not strong and not close enough, at least the outside world. The soul can see that Kerry has changed from a meditation posture to a half-squat gesture. The elf lowered his head slightly, and the little scorpion covering his ears had been untied, as the moonlight-like smooth and bright pale blond hair was licking his shoulders and back, and one of his hands was pressed to the ground. The other hand holds the longbow, and the quiver is in his reach. The "silver crown" and the "starlight" are hung on both sides of his belt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair caster nodded to him and then disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wide Dolphins are being driven by a whip, like a donkey or a horse . The person who waved the whip had no guilty conscience, and the "wide dolphins" did not want to escape or rebel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She kept her head down, so I can see that these adults are wearing shoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the person who has been asking questions and giving orders, wearing a pair of whale skin boots on his feet, the boots and the boots are densely holed, each The holes are the same size, the bottom of the boot is wood, so high that the sand doesn't get into the boots - but she doesn't pay much attention to it anymore. She always runs on her own feet before she turns fifteen. go with. So a pair of feet ran wide and long, like a long beggar, but after she had a slave, she had less chance of working her own feet. The fat was born on her, and her legs and feet were not as flexible and powerful as before. Running breathlessly, the throat seemed to be stuffed with a piece of charcoal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she didn’t dare not run. These people had a whip and a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the "empty house" and the dock are not very far away, they are finally there before the "wide dolphin" spits out their lungs. "It's just... there." "Wide Dolphin" said eagerly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is this 'empty house'?" asked the headed person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 23rd son of the Nanzhao Lord is here to manage." His entourage answered with respect and respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I know that guy." Their leader scornfully said, then he made a gesture, and one took the "wide dolphins" away. And he led some people to take a few steps forward, from the shadow of the palm trees to the bright moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me," he said with a gentle voice: "Is the only and only disciple of the respected Beavis adults here?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak your intentions." The elf said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I need to see the grown-up person," said the leader. "But I can guarantee that we are not malicious." He paused for a moment: "Maybe As you know, the distinguished Davis is the only and only son of the East Crown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona exchanges a look with Birdwin As the king of Norman and the Sir Alex Ferguson. Of course they would not know nothing about the other royals and those in power. The Longhuo Islands have no kings, and the four lords, as the four largest islands, rule the territory floating in the deep blue sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Beavis has stepped into mourning the wilderness for several years," said Kerry Ben. He has only been with Beavis once or twice. Although Beavis' wife is a half-elf, I don't know why he and his wife are not willing to be too close to the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have got this sad news from the Master Alva Master of Bituminburg." The leader said: "It is because of this, we I hope to find his descendants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I know, Kreima is just a disciple of Beavis." Mei Mi whispered, as a Fu Pastor Luo, she used to be indifferent to these things, but now it sounds like their companions will be very good - she thinks that if Kreima really can be involved with the lord of a dragon fire island, then She may be able to enter a certain Temple of Fro in one fell swoop: "or be born out of wedlock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the caster does not leave his blood, His disciples can inherit all his possessions.” The thieves said that because they often received some assassination and framed tasks, he had a deep understanding of this, so that the charges were too low: “even if he has his own son or Daughter, if the latter is not a caster, then they only Take away those things that have nothing to do with magic, or some casters will leave a document in the temple of Cranovo, affirming that all of hiss are inherited by his disciples - in addition, the difference between the Longhuo Islands and the unmarried children "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei also wants to ask, but the thief is more than a gesture, she immediately quieted down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first person in the crowd suddenly turned around As he went, the caster was falling from the sky, his hands were caged in long sleeves, and he couldn't see whether he was holding the casting material or making a gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respectable and powerful caster, respected adult," said the first person calmly: "If you are a disciple of Beavis..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first person briefly and repeatedly considered it for a while, then He relaxed his shoulders, stepped back two steps, and bowed respectfully - like the "wide dolphins" on his knees, first put down the left knee, then the right knee, bend the waist, hands on the forehead Below, the head and buttocks do not exceed the knees of the erect, but his posture is much more beautiful than the "wide dolphins". Although he is a young man, he is like this when he starts this humble movement. Elegant dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
