The fat cat hesitated, Holding the butter lamp in her hand, she took a little warmth from the glass cover. I don't know why, she felt colder and colder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t say anything stupid," her hostess said bluntly: "You should know that there is nothing in it. Besides my jewelry," she Say, "Clay stone, ruby, emerald, tourmaline, the gems you imagined, you can't imagine, just take it out and you can get a full line for a knight, as well as horses and From the velvet and satin of a whole box, I know that you like to embroider lace by hand. Unfortunately, you can't afford even a handkerchief. You and your child, you are going to let him be like you. Hungry for a few months, can't even eat a piece of honey cheese? Open it, child, I won't say nothing, open it, so you have everything."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why didn't you take it out before?" The maid asked, their embarrassment lasted for more than a day or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I always wanted to give it to the Thieves Guild to avenge my child," said the lady. "But I just got the news that he is dead." I don't need them anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat cats don't know if they should believe in their hostess, there is an ominous premonition that always hovers in her heart.

Her mistress was so rash, so arrogantly So many treasures are randomly stacked on a piece of black velvet.

In her hands, she was desperately surrounded by her chest. She heard the sound of gold and gold, the treaches of gems and gems. Ah, this is a wonderful sound. It is more touching than the voice of the nightingale. With this rich dowry, she Not only can you become a daughter of the knight, it is not impossible to be a princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her mistress stepped back a few steps as she pushed the lid, and she retreated to a place where the butter lamps could not be illuminated, her indifference Watching her maid tempted by the phantom, she completely lost her sense and control, constantly inhaling the dangerous gas volatilized by the mandala's potion, which can paralyze a majestic bull in an instant.
