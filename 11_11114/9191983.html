This is a kind of courteous self-control. It is a pity that the deceased did not have a voice. After he was buried for a few years, he dug out from the hills that were renamed the mountain of heaven. He was reburied in the lower church of the Franciscan Church. It was a magnificent hall. From the wall to the top, there are beautiful murals. Above the sage's tomb, stands a jeweled gold-colored lodge - and underground, according to the conventions, beliefs and laws of the time, has a promenade-like mausoleum. In the semi-circular white marble arch is a shackled tomb with a sarcophagus carved with saints, angels and flowers. The sarcophagus is mostly empty, but some people have been gloriously and sacred forever. Sleeping in a place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, very few people are allowed, or willing to come in, although some will clean it regularly, but in such late nights, even if it is called "death" The "Sister" of the Franciscans of the Franciscans will not be happy to come here with the dark ears of darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Lard Skin” is a mercenary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, twenty-six years ago, when he was strong and young, ambitious, as a bohemian, he was not willing Caring for the fields, and not willing to look after the cattle and sheep, the Hungarian king Hungarian Jane Mashash I decided to recruit a standing army that was independent of the great aristocracy (people called them because of the Knights and soldiers of the Legion wearing black armor) When he was a black army, he did not hesitate to sign up and became a soldier. Think about how proud and happy he was at that time, even if he could not wear the black armor like a knight. But as a leader among the soldiers, he not only has a pair of steel shackles, a large shield, and a arquebus. It is a pity that the good times are not long. In a fierce battle, he was pierced by a spear on his left shoulder, and then he could not return to the "Black Army." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the injury healed, he also worked for other mercenaries. The nickname "Lard Skin" was from that time, with a bit of ridicule. It means that “lard skin” knows that some stupid people think that they are not brave enough, but where is the brave person, they have long been a meal for wild dogs; then he was occasionally hired by a bishop, but this adult does not need The soldier was an assassin. After completing a few jobs, the "luck skin" was surprised to find that the assassin was the best career for him - he liked to quietly put the silk rope on the neck of the prey and grab the wooden ball. Look down and listen to the last snoring from the teeth. In the process of working, he will cling to the victim's body and feel the last powerful but futile struggle, just like being able to taste from their body. Take precious anger. He knows that this kind of thought and behavior is almost similar to the devil, so carefully not let anyone know about this unique little hobby<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks at the cross behind him," In the name of God." He whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assassin waited less than a quarter of the time for the candle, and a slight snoring came from above, like "Lard Skin". The people took off their shoes. After all, whether it was the bottom of the wood or the bottom of the cowhide, it would make a very loud sound on the stone floor. He held his breath and waited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ————————————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua is very cold, chill tonight It seems to be extraordinarily strong. The cold is like an awl. It is placed on the sole of his foot. He puts a lantern on his chest and blocks it with a cloak. It is like the holy lady holding a lantern when the Virgin worships the baby. His mood is the same. It’s anxious, like a thirsty traveler who can’t wait to go to Ganquan. At the moment of entering the mausoleum, the oncoming darkness makes the child shudder and shudders. He walks down, the ladder is missing. The corner cut his toes, but he still walked down unconsciously. The lantern could only illuminate less than a foot beside him. He was like walking into a big mouth opened by a giant beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua raised the lantern and he began to be alert after seeing the face of the "luck skin". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came from the orders of adults." "Lard skin" said that while lifting the waist robes, let the children see the coat of arms drawn on the long underwear. : "I will visit you on his behalf, and your mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to Joao?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you talking about my predecessor?" "Lard skin" said: "He broke his leg, and he is not called Joao, he is Bart."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua’s eyes are less nervous. “How is the situation of adults?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A little tired, but apart from these He is like a bull." "Lard skin" replied, recalling that before he left Rome, he heard that his master had a banquet with fifty deer and twice as many shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joshua’s description of the “luck skin” was slightly sympathetic, but his desire for his father quickly made him move this little thing aside: “ Does the adult have a letter to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I officially came for this." "Lard skin" said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua put down the lantern and hurriedly took the brass cylinder. He unscrewed the cylinder and poured out a roll of parchment. The frills of the parchment curled up with a bright red lacquer on it, a unique seal on it. When Joshua saw the familiar seal, he finally put down the last trace of doubts - in his concentrated and hungry reading of the letters. When the words came, "Lard Skin" went behind him: "It’s too dark," the Assassin seemed to inadvertently say, "Let another candle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the very beginning, Joshua didn't even understand what he was saying. He heard the sound of a flint tapping, and then the light in front of him suddenly swayed. It was entirely instinct. He raised his hand and grabbed his throat. Even before the letter was dropped, the silk thread passed over the boy's nose, slipped down his jaw, and tightened at the position of the knot that had not yet been raised. The child's feet slammed violently, and the lantern on the floor rolled over and extinguished in a crisp squeak. The assassin arched his back and covered him with his own body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua’s ears creaked, and the eyes were covered with a gray haze. He heard the murderer recite a poem in the Bible. His voice is greasy and calm: "God, please bless me, because I trust you," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My heart, you said to the Lord, You are my Lord. My advantage is not outside of you.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the saints of the world, they are beautiful and good, and I am most pleased..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lard skin" The clucking sound he is familiar with, hey, whether it is a child or an old man, always seems to have endless strength in the face of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With the other gods replacing the Lord, their sorrows will increase. I will not offer the blood that they have poured, and my lips will not mention the name of other gods." No..<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord is my inheritance, the part of my cup. I am holding you for me.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the amount of rope given to me, it is located in the beautiful place. My industry is really beautiful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will praise the Lord who taught me My heart is also alerting me at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, this is his only prayer that can be coherently reconciled. Funnyly, this is not for the sake of Praise or confession, but to determine how long it will take to complete the work on hand - this is one of the tricks that the assassin who taught him how to use the wire noose to give him a slap in the face of a child should be prayed continuously. More than two times, strangling a woman with a full chest, it takes four times, a strong man, five times, the old man needs six times or seven , Although they are aging, weak flavor, but compared to the young but requires less air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will put the Lord in front of me. Because he is on my right, I will not shake.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So my heart is happy, my spirit is happy. My body is also to live in peace.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will show me the path of life, the joy of satisfaction in front of you, and the eternal happiness in your right hand. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lard skin" continually recited three prayers before putting down his hands, untiring the silk rope, letting the boy lie flat and cold like a sleep On the rocky ground. He pulled the dagger out and moved it under the child's nose. There was no fog that symbolized life. He wanted to open the boy's mask to see his dead face, but his fingers were still in the mask. The edge stopped. "Lard skin" picked up the boy, put him in an empty stone sarcophagus he had observed and selected before, and then moved the heavy sash.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He lights up the lantern again, extinguishes the candle, picks up the fallen letters, and the parchment wrinkles are very powerful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————— ———————————————————————————————————————————————— —————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Valencia, also known as Caesar of Borgia, firmly following Julio’s Fortunately, the impulse of Little Medici was fleeting. They slowed down and hid themselves in the shadow of the colonnade. When the assassin took hold of Joshua Bo himself, the black shadow of the candle was stretched away from them. Less than a foot, they are shaking, like the devil is about to crawl out of hell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They listened silently, just as the priest of Valencia wanted When he went out, Julio suddenly took him, and then they heard a dangerous breathing sound - the assassin went back and forth, he stood between the columns, quietly, beheading on his side Reflecting the faint light.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may have been a hundred years old - at least teenagers and boys think so, just like the last time Silently left.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Julio first ran out of hiding place, Caesar hesitated and followed, but what surprised him was Zhu Leo did not flee in panic, but rushed to the stone sarcophagus and began to push the lid hard. <b r /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is dead! Caesar whispered, the Borgia family also supported the assassin. He also saw the punishment with his own eyes. Men and women have it. An adult who has been stranded for so long will certainly not escape, let alone Shuya is just a child.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me! fast! Julio panted and said that he was only six years old. Although he was very healthy, the height of the cover had already passed over his head. He couldn't use his strength even if he was kicking his feet.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caesar sighed in a short sigh, just as Julio thought he was still rejecting, Caesar pulled a flat iron bar from the back of the altar and inserted it into the coffin. The gap, exhausted the force to push it up, and then pushed back, rubbing the lid and rubbing against the stone, giving a squeaky squeak, but in the next moment, a terrible bang swayed the entire mausoleum, covered Falling on the ground, it is torn apart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then let Caesar’s more stunned things happen, Medici’s Julio is like a cut off tail The rabbit jumped into the sarcophagus like a fiercely, and made some movements that Caesar could not understand, but could understand: "I said he was dead! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Give me some light! Julio hurriedly ordered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caesar paused for a moment, or ran over to light the candle, he turned the candle to the sarcophagus and saw that Julio had Joshua’s mask was opened, although it was known that Joshua had always used a linen mask to hide his face because his face had major shortcomings, but Caesar was the first to see his face so clearly. - What a terrible face this is. If you paint this face on a mural or in a relief picture, people will see that they will scream at the devil and run away - it is made up of countless reds. The lumps of the colored tumors crowded together, occupying the entire forehead and the left face. Because of their encroachment, even the intact right face was pulled to the deformation, making Joshua’s face look like a semi-melting Wax head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julio has no time to think too much, thanks to the tradition of the monks not wearing any underwear and buttons, a thin and loose The robe is very suitable for first aid.<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows why Caesar insists that Joshua is dead. If it weren’t the parchment that was stuck between the silk rope and Joshua’s neck, Joshua did die, but Because the light was dim, and the Assassin put Joshua on his chest, he couldn't notice the slight gap. When he put down the rope, the parchment fell. Julio couldn't confirm. Does Booka really have a chance to be saved, but before he became Julio di Giuliano de Medici...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
