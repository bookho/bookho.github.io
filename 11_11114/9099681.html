( . .)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;818 My best peers<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to say is that I am... ...a necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People’s impressions of us are always full of fear and boring – if they are not seeing a gray robes, they can walk and talk immediately Clever escapes - sometimes they can't, and sometimes they don't want to, have to say, I can't understand the latter, they always feel that they can trade with a lich and get considerable benefits from it. I must really say (although my respectable master is such a cursed bone shelf), as a mortal with a life span of only one hundred years without external interference, what makes them think that they can with at least one The undead who were born by their high-grandfather bargained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the devil in the endless abyss will try to avoid dealing with a lich. Camila, an unfortunate one, and the female succubus that worked for me under the same master complained endlessly about her own bad luck. As a lich, he must first be a mage, and the mage It is inevitable to be proficient in all kinds of spoken and written and their derivatives - like records, instruments, contracts, etc... In short, you want to play some tricks in the text or wording in front of a caster. It is self-deprecating; secondly, he must be an undead person. This sentence sounds superfluous, but I still have to make a special statement. You, the undead are not synonymous with the living. On the contrary, they run counter to each other. Far away, no matter which lich can only be said to be a bone shelf (after being a half lich, it is some bone shelf), they have no tongue, no nose, no stomach, no important organ you know, so I don’t need delicious little cakes, I’m not interested in fragrant wines, and my beautiful beauty is meaningless to them. No, I can bother. We are out of the lab and the study's only gold gems, rare magic materials, as well as your body, you and your offspring - the most essential soul. In other words, they may be looking for things that you don't want or can't lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or some people feel that losing a little property or even a child is not okay to achieve their goals. The problem is that you have to remember that a lich is always in lawful evil. Camp, yes, you can't just remember the order and forget the evil. The way he acts and the path of thinking are unpredictable. Many people do get what they want, but they immediately find that they are losing. More. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this is not the worst place. The worst thing is to trade with a leader who is not dead. It is not to buy a light wine from an occasional trader. You give him a copper. He gives you a bottle of light wine. The silver goods are two, and then you will naturally forget each other; the lich's memory is always very good, and there is no suitable word in their dictionary to stop the existence of this word. Understand, even if the transaction is completed, and you are fortunate enough to have your brain and soul, don't expect you to break with the most evil spellcasters on this plane – they will always have an entanglement with them. Humans are seen as an alternate tool for coins or food. Before you can grab the soul jewels, you can't imagine how much you haven't done yet on that damn contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if nothing else, as a non-dead person, their existence will last for many years, even your family has already cut off the blood, and they Still screaming in their underground palaces - your sins will continue to your children and grandchildren, as long as they are carrying your blood, I have read as a master of my master to the poor devil who is not to fight. They never know the content of the contract, which has to blame one of their ancestors, although they can be said to be completely innocent, but the repayment is still repaid, the lich’s interest is no more than the main material plane loan shark Lower, and his means are more sophisticated and faster than the latter - you don't want to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, wait, let me think, I seem to go too far, sorry. So let's go back to the beginning of the topic, yes, we are talking about people's mistakes about us<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this doesn't blame them because they can only The door leading to the endless darkness opens silently, with red eyes and a gray-white flame. The tall, like a unicorn's nightmare slowly steps out, their knights are always dressed to cover the whole body to the black. Armor, hand-held rifle, waist-hanging wide sword, whispering or simply staying silent from beginning to end, and we always work for the evil, so with their poor imagination, they think we will be ours when we don't have to complete the task The owner is in the box, or buried in the dirt, like a sword or a plant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is not only wrong but also very ridiculous. We are not lacking in wisdom. We can even say that we still have growth in this area, and we also keep it. As part of the emotions of the living, although they are distorted (in any case, we have become evil), so even if we have been transformed into a pile of black sputum filled with negative energy, it will still I hope that there will be a place that is not so narrow and dirty - in general, it will be a half-plane with a constant technique applied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This semi-plane is not close to the negative energy plane or close to the shadow plane. Our residence is in the shadow plane. The host has set up a permanent portal for us so that we can freely carry out the work that he delivers. Between the two planes, of course, this portal is generally limited, such as allowing only undead creatures to enter and exit, as this half-plane must have enhanced Necromancer spells, death fields, and rest areas. Related spells, or vice versa - simply put, if there is a white robe chasing us back here, then he will find himself like an insect stuck to the spider web, even without us, He will soon become weak and die--so as his body and soul can survive how many masters arrange the time of the place, but in order to reduce trouble, our time is condensed, like this eternal And the dead plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I say this is because there is a new person between our neighbors and my colleagues. Of course, we certainly have neighbors. What is worthwhile is that our master is a half lich (a half-devil lich, not a brain-destroyed lich who failed to convert), and his disciple is also a half lich. Shallow, but he also has his own Necromancer, and the half-plane, the two half-planes are very close, like a pair of pendulums hanging on the ends of the balance bar, they are irrelevant in peacetime, but Occasionally, the turbulent flow between the stars will push them closer and overlap, so that we can talk to the other half-plane of the Necromancer, hunting, or hunting together - I have two The shadow dog is used to hunt down the strangers and souls who have entered this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one and the half plane closest to us is a disciple of our master, and then his half plane is close to the half plane of his only disciple. So occasionally, there will be three masters of the Necrotic Knights gathered together, because the last plane is in the negative energy plane, we often gather to the negative energy plane to bully the corpse or the vampire - not to say There are no creatures in the shadow plane, but all creatures are as vacant as the projection of the main material plane. Hunting them not only brings fun, but it makes you feel depressed like a bad deception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you mean that the Necromancer will not be depressed, this is really a misunderstanding, any kind of intelligence and memory will be depressed, Devils, devils, dragons, undead creatures, of course, even our master's disciples, yes, the one that I mentioned before, the one who set the half-face in the negative energy plane, Rubbing the claws with the Mithril wall in the tower to solve the negative emotions is his masterpiece - he has already guessed who he is, indeed, this is quite famous in this plane - yes, that is the meaning, please don't misinterpret, Don't say his name, I am just an ordinary Necromancer, I don't want to touch any god's sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what I want to talk about today is not the one, but his disciple. It is more correct to say that he is not his disciple. It should be said that his disciples are all and only one of the dead knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brothers and I are very surprised why there is such a Necromancer, he is very strong, I admit, he has a tall and dangerous Nightmare, there is a set of armor crystals formed by the crystal of the negative energy plane. If you think these are the standard of a Necromancer, what about a soul weapon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people will misunderstand the so-called soul weapon is that you go to find an elf or a dwarf, or a gnome to create a fine gold that can be used to enchant Mithril weapons, then find a good gray robes to capture a soul for you, and then put this soul into the weapon, everything will be fine, wrong, dear, you are wrong, if the soul weapon can be made like this There will be grey robes and lichs who will equip themselves with such an army around the clock. No, if you want to cast a soul weapon, the first thing you need is a soul that is stubborn and tenacious and full of deep love for the user. The requirements may not be difficult to achieve, and the latter, who will produce an empty armor, or retain the original love? The most common feeling we feel is hatred is disgust. Even our parents will not admit that an undead is their son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I won’t feel sad, though we will still be angry or, as we said before, depression, but we know that we have been once again Wake up has become another kind of existence, we are completely different from the living, even with the soul walking on the mourning wilderness, and the devil and the devil are not the same, we can only hear the owner The call, not the god, no matter which god, our road is long and dark, only the way to go without a retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we just have a little bit, a little bit, a slight... envy, even though the bastard still complains that he can’t do it with his lover again, Of course, you and I know everything, and more than once, be beaten by his own weapons - every time the planes overlap, we can see this magnificent scenery, imagine, in the negative energy of the gloomy silence On the face, a knight who is struggling to hike in the dust and gravel with his head, does not know how many innocents are on the way. Let’s say so, at least they have not been able to sin for this. Maybe you will have questions, what is his nightmare? It's also a question that puzzles us but doesn't hinder us from being happy - his nightmare likes his weapon, um, the soul in the weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
