			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord, the consul, two representatives of the parliament, and two representatives of the people were taken by Antonio’s apprentices in a small room with no windows, and it was almost unadorned. Five chairs are placed on the icy stone floor, and the chair faces a smooth, flat wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A high back chair - for the lord, a slightly lower high back chair for the consul, then four simple and low styles Back chair, two people's representatives - a goldsmith, a tailor excitedly and screaming at their hands and clothes, since their great-grandparents, they are residents of the White Tower, but sitting in a room with the lord There is only one seat and a noble Sir Alex - this is something that has never happened in their most arrogant dreams! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watching a mage cast a spell, returning the soul of a dead man from the mourning plains back to the living world, and with her Dialogue is also the scene that has never appeared in their most terrible nightmare... There is a big lamp holder hanging from the top beam of the room, and the candles on the lamp stand are lit up. It stands to reason that this room should be Bored and hot, but these representatives still feel cold hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange young man came in, the apprentice of Antonio Master saluted him and called him Master Crimmar, his hair was black, The eyes are shining like stars - there is a face that is very fond of the girl, the tailor thinks that the white knee-length robes on the body are too simple, no embroidery, lace, edging, buttons are not gems Or pearls, it makes people suspect that they are not a mage but a devout monk - but he still stands up with the lawmakers. After all, it is a caster, and the wizard is only slightly to them. At the beginning of the jaw, he seemed a little less respectful when he bowed to the lord, but soon, they had no time to take care of these little things. This wizard, who seems to be not very reliable in terms of age, has stood in the empty space. In front of the wall, recite spells and make gestures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representatives of the parliament and the people looked intently and unconsciously opened their mouths - the thick walls made of stone were melting like the snow under the scorching sun. The special room with which they were separated by a wall was unobtrusively displayed in front of these mortals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many candles burning in that room, the heat distorts the air in the room, the light shines on their eyes, so they see everything Everything has lost its proper shape - Antonio Master stands on the outside of the ring of magic that is filled with various lines and patterns, surrounded by candles at the foot, along the ring of the magic ring for a whole week, each interval is about half a foot In the center of the ring, there is a burning brazier. The goldsmith’s line of sight is uncontrollably attracted to it. It’s a big, unremarkable large graphite basin. The price is only about its bracket. One in ten thousand - the multi-legged gold bracket wrapped in a vine shape presents a beautiful silver-blue luster, decorated with emerald leaves and obsidian fruit, which exudes seductive light under the illumination of the fire. The light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least 15,000 gold coins are needed. Goldsmiths estimate that it does not include manual expenses. Fine gold and Mithril products (appliance and armor) can only be produced by casters, elves and dwarves, while poor casters, elves and lovers. Almost no, and because of this, the prices they quoted are always beyond the rules of the guild, not too low, too high, but of course, they do not bother to join a mortal guild - He was thinking so seriously, almost forgetting where he was – until Demon made a different opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we only watch here?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also listen," said the black-haired caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon gave him a cold glimpse: "There is a spell separated," he walked over to touch the invisible barrier: "You can let us see and Hear what you want us to see and hear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The undead undead will carry the wind and ashes that mourn the wilderness," said the Lich: "It is harmful to the living."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For ordinary people," Demon said: "But I am a caster." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Summoning spells requires absolute concentration." The apprentice of Master Antonio said, "Your presence may cause spells to fail or call for greater danger." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, please note," Demon smiled. "You are insulting your mentor. I believe that the most powerful mage of the White Tower will not be blocked." There was more than one person in the ring and lost control of his spells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apprentice's face is whitish, but he still remembers Demon But the Master was still the White Tower's governor. He had previously quelled a terrible and huge riot. His family was saved, and the respect for the mentor, personal dignity, and gratitude and anger to Demon were intertwined. So that he couldn't speak for a while, he had to tighten his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody noticed when Kerry was going out and when he came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you like," Kerry, who came back, relayed the opinion of Antonio Master: "You can look and listen more closely, just your safety." He must be entrusted to himself, and he cannot extract more energy from the spell to ensure that the second person is not harmed or invaded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." Demon said arrogantly, turning to the door, the tailor quickly jumped from his low-back chair and moved a gap for Demon to pass through them, but he was too clumsy to be pulled by himself. The open chair stumbled, his foot hit Demon's cheekbones, and the mage involuntarily slammed and didn't fall. Even so, Demon glanced at him with extreme anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apprentice of Antonio Master opened the door for Demon, and the black-haired caster, the hybrid mage who also had half the blood of the elf stood by the door, with An unpleasant calm look, with his hands in the wide sleeves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demon checked himself with vigilance, but he did not find anything unusual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked into the special room used to cast the summoning spell, and the heat wave that made him feel a little difficult to breathe, but Demon did not pay attention to this at all. He greedily looked at everything he could see. As a caster, he saw much more than a goldsmith. It was a room with countless wisdom and power, every line, every pattern, every one. Decorations and patterns, spells are smelt in precious Mithril and gems, deeply embedded in the ebony floor and wall, forming a strong and strong prison, he has no doubt that this ring can be bundled Bound an abyss lord or a demon prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demon paused for a while and walked to the upper left corner of the room. From here he could clearly see the actions of Antonio Master standing in the upper right corner of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the mortal view, Antonio’s performance is unusually boring and flat, and he concentrates on the long spell and slowly gestures. The eyes were closed, shaking the body slightly, walking clockwise along the circle of the magic ring - the tailor did not take long to play with the lace on the shirt, analyzing its weave, the goldsmith’s sight from The brazier was removed, and the jewel pin of the Demon neckline and the amber amulet hanging by the lord on the chest were studied quietly. The two members completed a big deal in the sleeves with gestures and mutual enthusiasm, and the lord was stunned. sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a call from Antonio Master that awakened everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t see the process, but the results were already very impressive—the graphite pots were as tall as the giants, and the tips almost reached fifteen The roof of the ruler, then slammed into the ground, bursting open, the hot red flame swallowed the room, and fiercely rolled over to the outside world - representatives of parliamentarians and the public shouted involuntarily, Jumping out of the chair and trying to escape, Antonio's apprentices had to raise their hands and cast a spell that would help with emotional stability to calm them down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
