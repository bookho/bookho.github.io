If his reason has not returned, he will think he has met. The devil, it is said that adult monks often encounter such devils, they will take human energy, make them weak, tired, and eventually die - but he can also clearly feel that his lungs are re- The pain swelled quickly, and he gave a loud sigh first, then greedily absorbed the air that was always wet and chilly in the underground mausoleum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He..." Joshua heard a man asking, but the voice was too far away from him, and he couldn't tell who it belonged to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is alive." This is another voice, but Joshua can distinguish it because this is a child's voice, and in this monastery There are only two children, one is himself, and the other is Julio, Giulio di Giuliano de Medici, who just arrived here last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julio jumped from Joshua’s body, Caesar held a candle in one hand and grabbed his arm in one hand to prevent him from falling. This time he only It was discovered that the black hair on Julio's forehead was already close to the skin, and there was a little tiredness and uneasiness in the eyes, which in turn calmed the Valencian priest. In any case, it is obviously better than a devil. Dealing with more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, I heard the loud monk, the assistant, the priests have also rushed in, they are almost all naked, only a few A few bitter monks are wrapped in ramie-woven robes, hand-held sacred objects, crosses, and weapons. In this era, this collocation is not in violation. After all, robbers and lords sometimes do not care about their robbery. Whether the plunder is the residence of the Lord on the earth, which is why Bishop Bicromoni still needs to carry a strong servant on the road of pilgrimage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the appearance of a naked body that is extremely unsightly but can be described with great brilliance, is also inseparable from this era - in one Long underwear can be used by generations as a precious heritage. Whether it is hunger and cold, the civilians standing by the family, or the Duke who is arrogant and fat, they are used to enjoying the comfort of sleep. Take off all the clothes - yes, children, the elderly, men, women, this is also the relationship between the bugs and fleas can be crazy, after all, every day is very rich, unimpeded feast can enjoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop of Perugia and Bishop Bicroimini are late, but once they are in control, they control the entire chaos, only a moment, the saints The resting place restored the original calm, and several monks were left to clean and scrub, but look at the axe and dagger they held, obviously more than dust, more need to be removed should be hidden in the mausoleum only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua was placed in a sacred room, where a devout monk died here. Before he died, he asked to draw a white ash on the ground. The cross, then asked his monk brothers to put him on the cross - this is undoubtedly a noble act. There are already monks who are looking for white ash. If their little brothers die, they also hope that he will be fully redeemed and rested like the older brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are angels, there will be devils. Other monks insisted that Joshua did not need to go to heaven for the time being. They had sacred oil from the hands of a group of people, holy water and crosses, as well as strange all kinds of holy devices and amulets, white ash and hammer, candles And the awl... But in terms of how to treat, they started quarreling and shoving again - Julio listened for a while and found that they can be roughly divided into three categories, the first category is conservative, that is to say They wiped the holy oil and holy water for Joshua, and let him touch the holy things, preparing for the prayers and masses that stayed up all night, as for the bloody wounds, oh, wait until the saints pity, it will automatically Healing; the second is an activist. Although it cannot express disdain and dissent for the first approach, they agree that Franciscans are more willing to pay attention to those who are willing to work hard for themselves and others. It is necessary, and their treatment is - bloodletting. Seeing that Julio was almost unable to keep a smile on his face, but the monks said with conviction that the wound on the neck is bleeding, they should cut a hole in a more suitable place, let the bad The blood is flowing out. Just as Julio stared at them with an awl and a knife. Lord, he didn't understand why there was an awl here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearest monk from Joshua paused, and he immediately recited the name of Saint Francis three times in a serious and serious manner: "The devil took my hand." He said to the people around him, then he was kind. Gratefully nodded to Julio, and violently pushed away the pile or dry or plump flesh, and rushed out of the room - hope he didn't twist when he climbed the roof, Julio Not so heartfelt prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the devil apparently did not release his prey so easily, and several monks finally squeezed into the bed of Joshua, who took the bladder of the cow, The glass bottle and the funnel that looked like a long-handled horn, then they looked at the bleeding wound, and went straight to Joshua's ass. Oh, yes, this is the most popular form of medical and health care nowadays -**. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The potion is coming!" A high-altitude screaming, and the monks respectfully gave him a position, knowing that the syrup was also modulated. Not everyone can, this is also a craft that can be passed down, but Julio sees a large bucket of muddy potion with a stench and bitter smell, so much that an elephant can be full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Julio said in his heart, I can't save you, Joshua. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final end of the farce was Bishop Bicromini, when the servant of the skinny and tall God looked darkly toward the wounded, No one dares to show off his piety and knowledge in front of him. Bishop Perugia is behind him, waving his hands silently, as if driving a group of ducks, except Joshua and Piccolo Bishop. The man rushed out. Before leaving, the priest of Valencia heard that Bishop Bicroimini was telling his disciples to prepare the belladonna and the mandala. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously looked at the little Medici who was being taken away by the goldsmith priest, and the title of the wizard swept past his agile mind. He grabbed it and kept it in a hidden place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—————————————————————————————————— ——————————————————————————————————————————————<br颠<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The belladonna is a very dangerous purple-black fruit. Many of them are stepmothers. When they don’t want their ex-wife’s children to inherit his father’s territory or gold coins, they will give He has a plate of gooseberry, and only needs to mix a few belladonna to solve all the troubles. But if handled properly, they can also be life-saving drugs, such as the dried fruits of Bishop Bicronomics in the bag, because they are suffering from cold, drinking unclean water or eating expired food. At the time (this is a very normal thing), he will take a few of them in a hot soup and let the patient drink it, which can stop vomiting and diarrhea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he now uses belladonna to enhance the breathing of the injured and to produce anesthesia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Bishop Piccolo took out the needle and the thread, the eyes of Bishop Perugia grew wide, and he couldn’t help but chanting In the scripture, one hand gripped his cross tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to sew the wounds," Bishop Piccolo said impatiently. "It’s not to stir the stool or ride in the big pot. With a fire stick flying into the sky, why do you behave as if there is a demon to jump out and drag you down to hell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen relevant records in the book," Bishop Perugia said with a sigh of relief - on the one hand he was full of curiosity and wanted to see how the wound was stitched up, and on the other hand he could not contain it. The land wants to tremble: "Some wizards will sew the head of the thief who is beheaded on their shoulders, and then order the dead to stand up and do things according to their orders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "In college, I said that you should read less useful illustrator manuscripts." Bishop Bicroioni said without raising his head. "Or I immediately walked away, lest my dear little brother. Unfortunately died of fear brought by ignorance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not written in the holy book The silk thread sutures the human wounds." Bishop Perugia whispered, but he just moved the chair to the door, against the door, and took on the duties of the disciple - who is the bishop of Piccolo Here, the bishop of Perugia has never been clear - the brother of his teaching, although he is harsh and temperamental, is a noble and gentle good man, which is why he hopes that Bishop Bicroimini will return. For Roman reasons, he needs allies, especially not to sell or betray him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
