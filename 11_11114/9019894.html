			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Run!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Run! Hurry up, hurry up!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf opened the bowstring, the corner of the corner of the eye slammed to the other boat to the left, Kremar stood at the stern, and the wind pulled his robes straight. The caster gestures and casts a flame. The flame spreads out in the two-legged dwarf dragon group that is closely following them. It engulfs four or five dwarf dragons, and has turned over ten, but there are still hundreds. Still in the doldrums. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fourth day they spent in the swamp. This year's spring swamps were particularly dramatic, and some places are completely different from the elves' memories. And because it is not all the way to walk on the marsh that is enough to carry the reed boat, a certain distance needs apprentices and mercenaries to pull down with the lizard, but fortunately under the guidance of the elves The reed boat is stronger than the reed boat of the black-footed half-length, and there is no problem of water leakage or even partial disintegration after the vessel is pulled hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some water marshes that are vast, but many are not willing to step into it anyway, even if people are tempted with sour berries, they are used in their whip The elf sternly stopped - after a little investigation, as Kerry thought, the water marshes were extremely sinister traps - the surface of the marsh was calm and waveless, but it was white with fine fluff. The small flowers are covered with a huge whirlpool. Numerous viscous and delicate muds slowly rotate around one direction. As far as they go, no one knows. Once they fall into it, no matter what they are, they will be swallowed up quickly. It’s like a hungry giant – no one knows how these vortexes formed, it may be out of nature, for example, the collapse of the dark river; it may be magic, the one they met outside the village The hybrid of the semi-dragon and half-devil is the use of a spell to carry a swamp to block the entire village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also saw a strange sight of the formation of a marsh whirlpool, about a hundred feet from the caravan - it was originally a gentle grass The hills, the grassy hills are covered with rich moss, and there are hundreds of delicate gray trees, but it is just a moment. Without warning, the water surface suddenly rises, rises and rises. I haven’t had a quarter of the ground near the moss and the trunk (they later discovered that the water is not rising but the grass is sinking), and then more, the wonderful thing is that the trees are not dumped, but remain Straight until the turbid swamp water engulfs the verdant crown. The water around it was boiling like a boil, and the people on the reed boat were almost stopped to breathe, but soon, before they died unconsciously, the swamp seemed to have been vented, and the floating branches were silent. It was swallowed without interest, and the water surface returned to calm. Perhaps before the glory of Rosada left the land that suffered numerous human curses, the tiny white velvet flowers would once again cover the vacant water surface. Later, people will never know what dangers are hidden under this water marsh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this. The caravan's itinerary has been slowed down, but only two or three days. The elf's keen sense can capture the slightest wind, the reed boat's direction - if there is a Google map in this plane, then people can watch The line was almost straight after removing a few obvious circles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if you want to go completely in the snow cover swamp, even if it is a dragon, you may not be able to do it. Kerry has already taken the caravan. Avoiding the seclusion of several behemoths he knew, but removing the gunfish that did not cause any damage to the caravan except for two poor elementary schoolers, they only encountered some minor troubles, including scavenging birds. With a swamp crocodile group The only thing that is not so well handled is the combination of a cluster of fear vines and a few geniuses. It is fortunate that the vines of fear are not from a demon or a devil, or a mage. It is derived from blood, so it has no ability to cast spells. It’s not mixed with the inextricable trolls—if it’s not the mage with a fluffy age (you can’t even call it young) stupid to cast a lightning beam, their previous battles can end. Earlier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The current will only enhance the power of the vines and the vines of fear and heal their wounds," the lich hidden in the body of the living being throws a spell Let the elf and the mercenaries shoot the arrow with a burning flame and say, "Have your mentor taught you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His The sound was almost inaudible, but the Master was so cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other wizard came to look for Crimall that night. Apologize to him, indeed, the too young little master is just a raw hand - this is his first job after leaving the mentor. "I taught him not to use lightning when dealing with the vines and the vines of fear." Class-like spells," the old master who had to be white, said apologetically: "He is a bit too nervous, so he will forget." He blinked at Kremar: "I have ordered him to copy a hundred times." You can't use thunderbolt spells for vines and fear vines."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who used to think that this is a reason, he thinks this little mage Throwing into the vine of fear is the best way to teach, no matter who. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caravan lost nine more people in the vines and the phoenix of fear, three of which were dragged into the depths of the swamp, and even the bones could not be found. The other few were pulled up together in time to wrap them together, but their bodies have been penetrated by these greedy carnivorous plants, their hollow tentacles pierced the human body and rooted on the bones. With the flesh and blood and bone marrow, people can cut off the part that stays outside the body, but they can't help with the things in the body - they can't cut it and look it over - in this case, even if there is healing potion and magic It is also very difficult to save them, and it is shattered by the vine of fear. This vine of fear may originate from an orc, in which you can find some characteristics of the orc, such as its roots will produce 獠The barbs are generally barbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also a few injured people, including the older mage, but not for his own sake—the monster snarled silently and cast a vote on them before they were about to escape the radiation range of the vine of fear. The ghosts that are pinched into the ball, the target is the mages who are still suspended in the air, so the Lich is quite speechless, the youngest of them will only shout like a Fro priest waving his arms. Calling, and unable to make a strong counterattack or defense - and finally his mentor had to pay for an arm to take him out of the creepy tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the owners of the caravan very angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this loss is still within the tolerance of people, although they will feel sad, but they will not be depressed or fearful, and get rid of the action. After the slow vine monsters, they continued to move forward under the guidance of the elves, after spending the night of only a few gunfish harassment. They ran silently all morning—but several smuggled mercenaries alerted a group of bipedal phoenix dragons when they competed with a cracked squid under the water for a red-billed crane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This creature inhabits reeds or mosses and is the size of a strong male turkey, but by name it is known that they are not humans. Harmless little cute, let the soul from another plane look. This is probably the case after the raptors in the Jurassic Park have shrunk by about three times. Their saliva is poisonous, their claws are sharp, their mouths are covered with barbed teeth, and the dark green skin is covered with scales. Muscular, there are also cockroaches on the hind paws, but the most frightening thing is that they are not living alone. Elf Kerry says their words make the souls of the outside world think of you - when you see one Only when, then there are a thousand around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about two thousand phoenix dragons that were stunned by the mercenaries. Even if it is a turkey, two thousand is enough to make people feel awkward. Not to mention the fact that these turkeys have the habit and teeth of a hyena. They have no concept of territory. They will chase the prey across the swamp as long as physical strength permits. Similarly, they don't have the idea of ​​satiety and picky eaters, both feet of gnome dragons eat everything from healthy, wounded, dead to rotten, although their stomach capacity is worse than the little devil in the bottomless abyss. Some, but also have sulfuric acid-like gastric juice, even metal can be digested, while excreting while eating is not unacceptable to them. The worst thing is. They have human intelligence and know how to use tactics - when they encounter big prey that needs to be chased, only a part of them will chase after them, biting the feet or tentacles of the prey. The other part keeps a speed that is not lingering, so the rotation does not stop, only when the prey reveals a trace of flaws, they will swarm up, tear open the abdomen and drill into the anus. Eye sockets, nose or any weak place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their jumping ability is very strong. If they are now riding a reed boat with a black-footed half-length, then the gnome dragon can jump into the boat with a single glimpse. Now the reed boat has one person high, they can only be like It was a monkey with only a crocodile head, and the leader of the gnome dragon, a scale, was especially shiny. When standing, the height was about the same as the gnome of the human waist. Some gnomes began to turn. Bite the bottom of the reed boat, and some of the ropes that grabbed the front and tried to bite off the multi-legged raft to pull the reed boat - the reed boat that was about to fall apart was thrown like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The follow-up gnome dragon immediately surrounded, and the solitary ship looked like a chicken bowl surrounded by hundreds of turkeys - not to say Poor, for the gnome dragon, it is filled with delicious food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the caravan took a look at Kerry Ben, even if he couldn’t stop other boats to rescue them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people are there on the boat?" Kerry asked, shooting an arrow through three pygmy dragons who wanted to jump into the boat. The arrowhead was planted into the dirty swamp water<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"16 people." The owner of the caravan said that with a slight anxious color, the boat Almost all of them are apprentices - and they are all going to be useful soon. He has nurtured them for nearly a decade, not to add food to the bipedal gnome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired spellcaster that floated in the air at this time fell, "I am going," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is on that ship?" asked the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caravan owner briefly confuses, but he immediately understands what the caster is asking: "And there is a pyroxene," he said: "and part of the fur "His mind is spinning fast, and almost all can hear the sound of whistling: "You can discard, if you can... save those people, the goods don't matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"How many pyroxenes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A thousand pounds, and they are all gravel, not very valuable." The owner of the caravan said: " ... Also, I am not suspicious of you... But do you need a helper?" The Masters will also cooperate if conditions permit, especially when faced with many enemies, the two pairs of eyes are better than one pair of eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He? No!" The soul of the outside world said categorically that he knew that the owner of the caravan was referring to the young wizard. His mentor had to wait until tomorrow to cast a spell, and even if it was, it did not want multiple pig teammates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He re-flighted into the air after he finished, and when he passed the boat of Leona and Plum, he saw Baldwin because the ship lacked strong The powerful male relationship was the most dangerous at first, but now the people on board have almost been preserved. They are concentrated in the center of the ship, lacking an arm, but still able to make the wide sword like a feather. The wielding former paladin steadily guards the rear and left and right sides - several mercenaries cleverly pull up the tough fishing nets, so even if the gnome dragon climbs the ship for a while, it will not be able to break through their defense, but the mercenaries The swords can penetrate the abdomen through the nets; Leona stands at the bow and grabs a long bow - it comes from the hands of the Seris, the owner of the caravan, the enamel is fixed Copper, the bow body is made of trees that are said to shed blood. It is heavier than the average longbow. The strings are twisted by silk ropes. The arrows are decorated with triangular copper clusters and have obvious reverse thorns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Leona did was to ensure that the rope connecting the hull and the multi-legged scorpion would not be bitten by the squatting pygmy dragon, her Arrow skills may not be as good as the elves, but enough to convince most humans, and it is worth mentioning that she can open the bow around, this is not a technology that everyone can have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world dropped a spell and made the rope greasy. Several unfortunate gnome dragons immediately fell and danced, Leona laughed. He made a thank you gesture.
