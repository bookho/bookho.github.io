At the foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Leona talked to her about such a child, she thought that the child was seven or eight years old, or ten years old, she was worried If the child shows the characteristics of the male too early to want to disguise him as a girl, it is difficult for her to worry about this now, the child in front is only three years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked the businessman that she wanted several children between the ages of three and four, and the smile of the businessman made Fro’s chief pastor not comfortable. The place, the rare cold face of the beauty, drove a man out of his room. She only hoped that the businessman’s mouth would be stricter. Don’t invite her to the temple to attract more visitors with special hobbies. Not a good person, and sometimes even a jerk, but she also has a bottom line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Leona is very satisfied, Mei Mi let her see the children, there are actually two of them are light blue eyes "The color of the eye is the hardest to change," said Mei Mi, unless the child has the talent of the caster. Otherwise, whether it is with herbs or magic will cause some damage to her eyes: "But the hair color can be changed without problems. "Fro's chief pastor said that in order to enhance the appeal and freshness, Fro's pastor often used a variety of techniques to change his hair color, such as using a lead comb with acetic acid comb hair, using sheep fat and grass ash Or, using the leaves of the laurel leaves, the charred ants are soaked in water and soaked in water. In order to make the color of the hair lighter and turn into gold, the feces of the camel urine and the crocodile are exposed to the sun... In short, For many years, Pastor Fro has long collected hundreds of secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahn’s children are light blue eyes, pale blond hair, and plum honey has specially selected a child whose appearance is very similar. No one will ever find that they have already made peaches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, are you going to send this child there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona slightly paused For a moment, she didn't expect Mei Mi to care about the child's whereabouts: "Captain Cobbert will send her to Bitumburg, where she can be well cared for."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is fine," Meimi hesitated. "Maybe you should know," she said. "I don't know the truth. But according to the merchant, these children are from the Highlands. Man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona’s expression suddenly changed, and Mei Mi took a step back, because the way the king is now is a little dangerous. She did not spend her time on the Longhuo Island, since she hit the fine gold hammer. After the sea demon, she seems to have found her favorite weapon, the heavy hammer hanging on the waist belt of her waist at any time, opposite her wide sword. Mei Mei glanced at the hammer. If it was used to beat a Fro priest, it would be much simpler than dealing with a half-orc. Fortunately, Leona is not the kind of person who will anger, she just slams Kneeling down, grabbed her arm tightly as a child shrank back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She used the lingua franca when she spoke to Mei Mi, but she used Norman in her conversation with the child, Mei Mi in Norman Highlands Live a while, in order to be able to perform your duties better. I have been studying Norman for a while. Norman is not a subtle and complex language, after all, it is born out of the barbarian tribe. Even the words are rare, so Mei Mi can understand what Leona is saying. She is asking the child's name, the name of the parents, the name of the hometown, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time she should probably be grateful to the children of these children who are not large serfs or civilians, even if they are only a few years old. It must also be skinny and brown, with no nice apple face and fair skin, so they were almost the children of craftsmen or merchants who were protected as expensive goods. I haven't been too scared. I have been educated by my mother and my sister before, so there are a few who can clearly tell what Leona wants to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a hidden feeling in the depths of Mei Mi. When Leona leaves, her expression is not so pleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Highland Norman..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona and Birdwin said in unison, Then they stopped in time and smiled a little bit. Baldwin made a "you first" gesture, and Leona nodded and repeated what she knew at Meimi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The merchants have already given an echo." Bydwin said: "They didn't even go to the kingdom, they met the escape on the border of Norman in the highlands. Civilians and tenant farmers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The amendment bill of inheritance was forced to pass through and angered my uncle," said Leona. "He is frantically eradicating dissidents." ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it’s the Thundersburg thing that made them taste the sweetness," Birdwin said sharply. "The new king is preparing to hold a huge-scale contest, inviting everyone who he thinks is worth seeing. He The knights rushed to various places, just to hand over his invitations to the hands of each invitee. They were said to be asked to bring their knights and soldiers. The knight was ordered to bring all the equipment, like a beggar, Armor, long and short weapons, and horses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does he want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I listen He said that he had a strong and mysterious army, a military composed entirely of knights. They might defeat the knights in the contest and take away the equipment of the latter, thus weakening the power of the nobility." Birdwin Guess: "Maybe it is possible that he will keep the courtiers who he thinks are not loyal and loyal to him, and then use inheritance and marriage rights to control their territory and dependants."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is crazy," Li Na said bluntly: "Even my father will not do that, and Norman Norman has never been a king. It belongs to every Highland Norman without a lord, or without the power of the lords. What is he going to do? In the face of Norman’s enemies or orcs in the Highlands?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin pressed his eyebrows: “This is what I am most worried about... I am simply It's hard to imagine that if we lose the Thunderbolt, the orcs will flood the entire Highlands of Norman like the tides drowning the beach. Does he think that he can fight so many enemies with his own army?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, you have already ruined enough orcs in the last battle," Liona reached out. Gently licking Baldwin's forehead, Baldwin had a broad, flat forehead with almost no wrinkles, but his eyes were covered with the gullies of the years, and the Norman kings of the Highlands kissed them tenderly: " And we only need a few years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods are on," Baldwin said: "I only hope that we can hope for success."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will bring Leona into her arms. Let her curl up on his knees like a child. He once hugged a little Leona like this. Now she grows up, only a few inches less than Baldwin, and the women of Norman in the Highlands. The skeleton is also thicker and taller than the skeleton of the southern women, but when she is holding her like this, the former paladin will still have a honey-like sweetness from the bottom of her heart. This is the person he loyal to, he Lovers. Will become his wife in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, he even wanted to shout out Tyre’s name and pray for his care and care, but in the end he quietly closed his eyes, not anxious, he said to himself, don’t be anxious, everything will be fine... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to say. Let this boat sail on the sea?" The Lich said that he had lived in the seventies for decades. Seven Islands. There is seawater in addition to the archipelago. Of course, he knows how terrible the power and the temperament of the ocean. That is not the case with this small and delicate folding boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," McGee said. "This is used to walk on the sea of ​​the North." The gnome said: "It’s like the black of the snow covered marsh." The reed boat used by the foot worms, see, we only have to catch a monster or a beast, or use spells and sails. It can quickly slide on the ice."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, you not only plagiarized the idea of ​​black-footed half-length people but also laughed at them as a group of locusts. The once undead shrugged and walked to the other side, where there was a soft and peculiar fabric that touched. "This is...clothing," said the gnome. "I use the silk of the sea spider and the fluff of the albatross. There are others. Some of the materials are made."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is special?" asked the Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mckey took a cylindrical metal object with a very fine mouthwash, he looked and lifted the metal cylinder to a beautiful Around the sculpture, pressed a few times in a row, the sculpture was covered with a thick white object, and after a few heartbeats, they solidified. The lich touched it and found that they were just what he saw. Those fabrics that arrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked Master Gavin and the Cavaliers to repair, what if the people of Highland Norman fell into the river in the coldest season? They said they I have to take off all the heavy clothes for the first time. Otherwise, the absorbent clothes will drag the drowning person down. This fabric is more interesting. It is warmer and lighter than the fur of the same weight and thickness. It is more comfortable than cotton. More tough, but it will dissolve in the salty water," the gnome said proudly. "So if we fall into the water, we don't have to take off our clothes, they will dissolve themselves, and once we climb the shore, we don't have to Looking for dry clothes, I know we all have pockets, but then we can bring something more necessary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," the gnomes moved to the ground Say: "If you feel the need, you can still wear one or two underwear inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure that it will maintain the advantages you said at extreme low temperatures?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No doubt." The gnome said something unhappy: “Although the Dragonfire Islands have never experienced the nuisance of bitter cold, we have runes that can lower the temperature of a place to something unimaginable... but, his eyes look to the other side: “This is me I asked the Master Gavin to help me with the test. He said that this is very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich walked forward without saying: "What about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drilling." The gnome said: "We have to consider the problem of food. This drill can penetrate a few feet thick slab. After we use it to penetrate the ice, You can catch the fish with hooks and flash bait on the ropes that connect it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rethink it," said the Lich. The ice surface of the sea is harder than steel, and the thickness may be calculated in terms of the inside. In addition, I know that there are few fish, only Many white prawn, and each prawn is only as big as your hook."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnome raised his hand and looked at the hook, no humble recommendation Next: "There is this," he said. "The large angle can make a huge sound and scare the beast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich does not say a word, "Maybe I can bring it myself." The gnome said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is this." The gnome showed a thing to the Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"cloak?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s a fake wing," said the gnome. On the ship, it is used on us. I also specially prepared a rune for it. As long as the rune is activated, a strong wind can be blown up, and as long as we expand it, we can fly like a bird."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you notice that Bedwin’s weight may be ten times that of you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can also bring this myself." The gnome said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that we can still find you from the snowfield, the Lich said in my heart. -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
