			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day's banquet was grand, but simple, the peacock without feathers did not have the brain of a narwhal, or hidden in a huge pie. Birds who can only sing on the 24th; because there are too many people in the table, there are too few people who have to use a glass of wine, and a bowl of broth and vegetable soup. Only Birdwin and the elves have a plate to roast. Meat, others can only use hard dry bread; there is only one absent-minded bard, no harlequin, no mage who is willing to dedicate one or two tricks, once the undead person has a consistently mean temperament, named it a goblin The bonfire feast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if the orcs will dance around the bonfire, etc.," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the alien world had to bow his head, and by using the opportunity of sipping honey, he used his glass to cover himself and he was funny and helpless. Fortunately, the Lich did not say more, he still has a lot of information about the Thunderbolt and the need to sort out, and one for the caster. Very important meditation and rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third day of hunting was quietly and silently opened in the galaxy that traversed the Scorpio, with a leather cap and On the side of the leather cap, a brightly colored hunter with two feet of blue feathers set off about two hours ago. They had already surveyed the Thunder Fortress for hundreds of miles in the days before. The place, the size of the potential prey, the size of the potential prey, the size of the potential prey, the size of the potential prey, the size of the prey, the size, Age, height and quantity, look for their trails, speculate about their range of activities - today's exploration is the last and most crucial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three hundred knights led by Byrdwin and the one hundred keen led by Kerry Ben are waiting under an empty bare rock, eating bread that serves as breakfast. Drinking clear water, they are preparing for hunting today. They have a very sensitive sense of smell and are suspicious, so they can’t drink alcohol. The knights also took a shower in the moat one day in advance to get rid of the stinky wine that is unique to humans. Flavor and barbecue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knight picked up a cracked faeces and showed it to his companions, "Grassroots." He said that some of the slag was exposed in the crushed faeces. A solid summary that cannot be digested: "They have already eaten the grass here and have begun to dig their roots."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in Thunderbolt have no good feelings about argali, they are wild creatures that cannot be domesticated, except for bare and gravel grasses, which are also of great interest to human wheat and other crops, and among them Strong rams are extremely aggressive. If there are humans grazing on their sites, the rams will rush into the flocks or herds, use them to be thick, bend them to the side in a spiral shape, and sharply extend the tip of the corners. The stab wounds open the invader's abdomen, or step on it with hard, steel-like hooves - each ram can easily jump eight or nine feet, and imagine how much strength their legs have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they breed very quickly. When humans have not yet occupied the dragon ridge, the number of people controlling them is a giant wolf. After humans have come here, in order to ensure their own safety, They expelled the giant wolves. Correspondingly, they had to take on the responsibility of the giant wolf. Therefore, in the annual hunting activities, the argali is the first and best choice among the residents of Thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are ready, when the horn of the hunter is far away, the elves and humans immediately turn over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that comes to meet them is the blue swimmer of the hunter, which is different from the falcon used by the nobility to hunt. It is petite and has only one adult man. The blue fists of the big fists are basically used as birds and birds. They are very clever. Even if there is no bamboo tube with letters on the feet, they can use the flying position, the number of laps and the way of screaming and slamming. To pass some simpler messages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hovered over the top of the human head and shouted loudly. After receiving the silver piccolo response, it began to circle around the hunting team, headed by the scout knight. Always looking up and watching its flight, he gestured to people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A big flock." Birdwin said: "Three hundred or more strong rams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hounds of the hounds became clear and loud from the faintness, and Cremari could feel the shaking of the ground under the horseshoes by another huge force, and Birdwin raised a hand. The human knight slowed down and the front line changed from vertical to horizontal. With this change, the second source became more and more intense, and the elves could already see the gray torrent flowing from the top of the bare rock. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a flock of sheep, usually they are just a small group of young rams who lead the eleven ewes, only when winter comes. It will form such a large group, and the white crickets will eat together, compete for the site and resist the predators, and sleep together at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In running, strong and violent, a young ram with a pair of horns smashed the ewes and cubs in the middle, followed by aging and injured rams, and they changed from a little jumping point to a capable The big monster alongside a teenager is just a matter of breathing. Hundreds of hounds run on their outings. When a ram tries to lead his family to escape from the side, they are surrounded by fanaticism. The ground screams and bites, forcing them to return to the hunter’s predecessor’s path of death – but the flocks are not ready to sit still, and a body erects almost rushes to the ram that is flush with the horse’s head. The hounds who threatened their wives with their teeth and claws, provoked a black big dog with double horns before they could spread in the future, and stepped on the eagle with a pointed hoof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big black dog was smashed into the air, dragging the bloody belly, and it was dead when it fell to the ground, and the other hound was involved. Under the hard hoof of the flock, it was too late to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the hound, a hunter with a long handle, shouted, waving the flail in his hand, slamming the sheep trying to escape from the gap between the hounds of the hound Group - he is equipped with a bow, he can kill the ram, but the rest of the flock will immediately spread out, running everywhere, for a loyal hunter, this can be said It was an unforgivable mistake, so he only skillfully hit the ram's horn with a thorny iron ball in a row, forcing it to move forward with the flock - ahead is a gentle and ridiculous valley and self-successful The man turned to the fast-paced human knights, and they did not hesitate to greet the furious sheep. Their horses were shining brightly, not inferior to the master's armor, and the front of the breastplate was spiked with a knight. They are holding tight steel darts tightly - the sheep and the humans are as fast and short as the thunder, the knights are stumped by the rams, and more are the human darts piercing their throats. eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flock of sheep that suddenly lost their heads is in a state of chaos. They have no rules and left and right, and they yell, the knights rush into The flock, split them apart, and then join them with their companions in small encircles. The first rams were shot. If they were not killed, they would turn into second heads. Leading the flock to escape, and they have more experience and memory than the young ram; the second is the smaller ram and the ewe, the lamb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are mixed among the human knights, and the knights who fell into the flocks and were almost killed by the horns and hooves of the rams were pulled up by them. - Only the elves with extraordinary strength and agility can do this. Kreima not only pulled up a knight who had two hundred pounds even if he didn't wear the whole body armor, but also helped him to have three times the weight of the owner. The horse, for this reason, he connected several heavy rams that fell out of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans have not completely destroyed the entire flock. The pregnant ewes and the still-fed lambs will be left behind. The old rams must also leave two or three. Otherwise, this flock may not be able to find it. Water, grassland and rock salt are dead and wounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are about a thousand sheep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin said with satisfaction, while taking off The helmet, like a thick big dog, violently shakes his hair, his hair is soaked with hot sweat, and the wind blows into a cold, damp waterdrop that he gets everywhere - when he When I saw Kremar, I immediately showed a happy smile. The white teeth shone in the dark gray beard: "You are the most powerful of the wizards I have ever seen - I mean, your body. "He praised: "If you have expired in the service of Gray Ridge, I would like to welcome you to Thunderbolt - even if you are not a mage, you will be a good heavy knight."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Kreima did not wear his white robe, but the tight-fitting robes woven by the spider silk of the silver-bellied spider like the elves, and then put on the outside Mithril chain armor, then wear the shoulder armor and the chest plate armor. This way of combining part of the body armor with the chain armor can guarantee the important part. From fatal injuries, but also to ensure the rider's own light and flexible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich is checking his shoulders, and the ram’s horns are stabbing them, but they don’t cause anything other than leaving a few obvious scratches. The damage, but the steel knights worn by the human knight horses have left a lot of imprinted pits, some horses have been injured, but fortunately they can be cured in just a few days of rest, the same is true for the knights, the most injured The serious man lost his face helmet when he fell off the horse. He was stepped on by a fat ewed ewe. His half cheeks were horribly shattered, but after the treatment of the priest, he could say safe and sound. It’s just that these days he can’t chew hard or tough foods, or his teeth will grow up in the young gums and bones, but he won’t be a handsome guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you waited for sixty years," Kerry Ben said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedwin made a face that was completely out of proportion to his identity, "Elves..." he complained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author’s words, this is yesterday, that, fell asleep, forgot As a result, I have been busy at work until now and I am in the office. There is still a chapter in the evening...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
