			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have!" Monroe shouted, his voice full of empty arrogance and real weakness, and he knew that he had nothing, no power, There is no money, no strong body and beautiful looks. Even the most important symbol of men has become weak and weak in the first two decades of debauchery. His lover is actually just a business. Old and ugly, he often pinches the little worm, "praising" that he is the most loyal and servant servant of Rosada, because even if he wants to do it, he is a poor one. The old cock used, she advised him more than once to go to the south of the Dragonfire Islands to find a job, where the lords used to use the monks to manage their wives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you have," said Fro's pastor, who and she were hiding behind a huge laurel tree, Monroe sitting on the ground, and Eph Luo’s pastor lies between his legs. “Good guy,” she smirked, one hand plunged into the white robe of Rosada’s pastor: “I tasted it last night, it’s really It’s amazing, it makes me scared, but you know, I’m not talking about this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**The aroma makes his mind swell, he is dizzy He has, he must have, he thinks that there is a holy emblem in his room. Rosada’s holy emblem is pure gold, inlaid with sun stone, reflecting the light of the sun like the scorching sun. You can give this to her, then tell the chief pastor that he lost the holy emblem. He may be punished, but not very heavy. He has served Rosada for nearly forty years and he deserves some compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." He opened his mouth and found that the heat in his body caused the tongue and the mucous membrane of the upper jaw to stick tightly together. There was a slight tingling, but he couldn’t care so much: "Have you brought that... oil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pink oil can make him Repeatedly rejuvenating the oil of youthfulness, let the slut of the sluts of Froo madly stunned him. She stared at him with a burning gazing gaze, clutching his arm and shaking himself enchantingly on him. How many years have you been in the buttocks, four years, or five years? For the first time, he tasted the familiar, long-lasting, sweet and sweet taste. He cried, biting his soft chest, his ears filled with longing screams and pleadings - God, God, how to call him? Described, at that moment, he was the chief pastor, the lord, the king, the omnipotent god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro's priest twisted his waist and let him see the gold chain around his waist, which had a small skin besides the bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now!" Monroe grabbed Pastor Froe's waist, his fingers deep into her skin, and he sniffed the woman's neck. The smell in the nose, like a pig, greedily arched, squatting, wet tongue licking the smooth flesh, and constantly biting her with teeth, biting bleeding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain made Fro’s pastor instinctively tremble, and she took a deep breath and subtly hid disgust and impatience before opening her eyes. "Now not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to worship us Goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let your goddess roll the ball! Monroe almost roared, but as a pastor, he bit his tongue in time: "Don't devotion to love is not the best way to worship Fro?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The best is never the way, but the piety," Fro's priest forced him to open, and she stood up and pulled the silk gown that had countless wrinkles: " I will come to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight, She said, throwing a smile to Monroe: "You will open the door for me, are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s raining," said the Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Il said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain is silent, the seven-horned leaves of the cracked maple cover most of the sunlight, and also cover the changes in the clouds, they at first However, it is a slightly thicker mist, agglomerating on the surface of the leaves, and as the water vapor gradually becomes rich, the accumulated amount becomes heavier, so that fine water droplets fall from the leaves and penetrate into the cracks, roofs, and guardrails of the trees. Hanging bridges that undulate in the wind, the wings of birds and insects, the hair and clothes of elves and half-elves. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wind blows the leaves away, the squirrels look up and they see the gray clouds that are as low as they can reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich sits face to face with Ilva, with a table that can be folded up in the middle, and the table is a chessboard and pieces that belong only to the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human and orc also have similar board games - all humans like chess in the world of alien souls, kings, queens, castles and knights Sixty-four black and white squares, even the rules are very similar, only in the subtleties with the preferences of the country or the privilege; the orcs call them war chess, the pieces are fierce Beasts or birds, in their rules, killing the king is not the final end. Only one of the pieces is slaughtered to win. Some orc aristocrats will use the captives to play chess. The lost pieces will be killed. Die or eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the love of the elves, it seems to be a combination of Go and crap game, they use thirty-two. In the azimuth of the rose compass, the chess player turns the pointer once and turns, and the chess piece must fall in the direction pointed by the pointer - in the huge disc, there are 676 densely arranged, slightly concave dots. You can choose any position (as long as the direction is correct), the pieces that are occupied by the direction and cannot be dropped, and the pieces that are surrounded by the opponent's different color pieces will be proposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many ways to discriminate between winning and losing, the simplest of which is the number of pieces left on the board, the more ones win; the more complicated way to judge For the sake of change - the souls of the outside world do not want to repeat here, because he feels that they are to create intensive phobia patients and revenge society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich is quite happy. He is the same master as the elf. If he has failed, then most of it has to be attributed to fate. - Just as the soul of the opposite world has been secretly moved, fate seems to like to joke with him and find some fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the thirteenth northwestern micro-north." Il is touching his chin, although she has no beard, "If you are on a boat, and this Every day the ship sails in the direction you are going, you may have been around the entire continent for a week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ship has to travel thousands of miles OK." The lich said not very happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Il妲 stretched out his finger and turned the compass pointer, the pointer swung briskly, and finally stayed in the northwestern micro-grid, and Ilby looked at the witch sympathetically. At the glance, I happily dropped my piece on the last small point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich turns the pointer - the fourteenth time, northwestern Weibei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to say? Kremar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich what Prefer not to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try another compass?" said the soul of the opposite world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to eat some sugar?" I'm suggesting that I have a sharp glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be proud, elf," the lich said coldly: "The distance from the game is still very early."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, that's right." Il said, while reporting a sincere, heartfelt smile - Krimamar is very serious for most of the time, so when he is occasionally childish It would be extraordinarily cute - when it comes to childishness, the female elf can't help but think of another mage. She wants to restrain the urge to sigh, but she still fails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today's game is doomed to be able to win the game, just when there are only a few dozen in the blank spot, someone brought management The message and the command - they found the trace of the perpetrator, and an elf almost became the third victim of a laparotomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill is one of the most outstanding rangers in Gray Ridge, and she is an indispensable part of this crucial game as an important piece. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cast a double apology to Kremar, in addition to the game, and Fenway’s suspicion of Kremar, although it did not Was made public, but Kreima did hand over his spell book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The spell book is in Fenway," Il said. "I asked him to send it back to you." He also apologized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't Fenway Master left?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The previous spell made him feel very tired "Ill's took over the cloak and bow that the elf brought to her: "The manager asked him to stay in the Grey Ridge to rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenway did not come Shortly after Iil, the gray ridge was completely immersed in darkness and dampness. A half-elf brought a message from Fenway, because Fenway’s body could not be supported, if Kreima needed him. The spell book, he also asked him to go to the home of Fenway, he expressed his apology for 120,000 points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think we need this spell book very much?" The Lich said to the sleeping soul in the sleeping world that he did not get an echo and did not need to reply. "Please tell the distinguished Fenway Master," he will face his face. Hidden in the shadow of the eaves: "I will retrieve my spell book, but not tonight - tonight is neither suitable for memory spells nor for casting spells, nor for two casters to meet - if Yes, please wait until the magical star river shines again on the gray ridge, which is the most suitable moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever it is, the undead is Added in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want?" Monroe pleaded: "This The holy emblem is pure gold, bite it, see how soft it is, and it is also inlaid with the sun stone. You take it out, pick it up, smash the base of the gold, take it out and sell it. Fifty, no, one hundred gold coins, I promise! What more do you want? What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro's pastor smiles sweetly, Her fingers were stained with the brilliant pink sacred oil, dancing on Monroe's body, circling and letting him groan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a bad problem," she said in the ear of Monroe: "Not so good and bad - I am very curious," she said. : "Very curious, I have a strong curiosity about all mysterious things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about that? My good girl." Monroe consciousness Fuzzyly shouted: "Is there anything else you don't know about me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Fro's pastor said, fingertips Get a piece of loose fat: "Yes, Monroe, you have a key, and that key can open a door, behind the door is a dark passage leading to..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To the foot of Rosada." Monroe shuddered, as if to wake up. "Rosada is on... You can't, there is not you can go in." "The place!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I want to see it," said Fro's pastor, secretly pouring all the grease left in the bottle. She holds Monroe, relentlessly: "good guys, give me a look, I've been thinking, going crazy." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"No..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please, good man." She pleaded and kissed his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...just look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monroe hesitated, twirling in ** and responsibilities, but really, he felt like he was about to be burned to ashes - "If, if you are willing to Luo vowed...just look and be willing to keep a secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Swear to Fro," Fro’s priest panted and said, slyly The subject, but Monroe could not notice this at all, her fingers, oh, her fingers: "I just go in and see, and keep secrets. I will be satisfied," she bit the little dot: " You will also be satisfied, good people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look." Monroe said, as if to give himself a guarantee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menro sneaked out of his room with Fro's pastor, the rain became bigger, but Monroe became more thirsty - wet The silk gown is tightly attached to the plump cock, which is more attractive than the full cock. He stares at the scenery and falls down several times, but he doesn’t feel any pain at all. I didn't feel cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the door, the dark passage was illuminated by fluorite, the walls and the ground were polished very smoothly, and the cold wind blew in from the unseen cracks. Trembling, teeth fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro's priest caught the bell, perhaps her illusion, it stretched out a lot of cold thorns, stinging her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, this is the source of holy water." Monroe whispered, with pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot of the Rosada statue is an empty stone room, a pump driven by a rune plate that draws clean water from the dark, deep underground to the ground, Fro The priest noticed that there was a point in the water shining. She walked over. It was a fine gold hollow ball, smaller than her bell. The little light of the star leaked out of its gap and dissolved in the water. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gift of Rosada," Monroe said triumphantly: "There is a rock that has been blessed by Rosada, so the water that flows through it can invigorate the spirit and cure the disease." But every seven days, it will be changed. The exchanged stone needs purification and long prayers to get Rosada's blessing once again, but this one will not say to Fro's pastor: "You can keep secrets, are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already sworn," Fro's pastor grinned. "Don't you believe in a vow made by a pastor to his god?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...OK, okay," said Monroe. "I believe in you...we should go."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said Fro's pastor, "Sleep, Monroe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Fro's priest came out of the sanctuary in Rosada, he was shocked by the man who suddenly appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled up the hood that almost covered the entire face, reaching out to the priest, and the priest recognized the hand with the ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened the hollow bell and pulled out the gold ball that was replaced and placed in the man’s hand - with one bag heavy The gold coins were thrown at her feet, and she hurried to squat, and the man was gone when he straightened up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fro's pastor gave a sip, she felt a little uncomfortable, maybe stayed in the rain for too long, and mixed with Rosada's pastor too Long time - to make sure that this stupid pig has no impression of a short coma in the dark passage - she bowed her waist, lowered her head, opened the leather bag, there were gold coins, at least one hundred, or More, she threw Monroe into her holy emblem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day Monroe failed to get up on time to meet the morning, the chief pastor went After reading him, he found that he was ill, probably because of the rain, so he had a fever. Yadel gave him a little water that was blessed by the god of morning light. The poor guy screamed awkwardly. I slept again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are more people who come to the sanctuary to pray for Rosada to bless." Yadel’s teacher said: "The leaves of the laurel tree are almost gone. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are afraid of being infected with madness," said Yadel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a popular madness in the outer city?" the teacher asked: "Your father, and your brother, seem to be tracing the matter, with results. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not at the moment," Yadel sighed and said: "Only those who have committed madness are porters - fortunately these two There are no similar patients in the day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful," his teacher said: "I don't think things will end so easily." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author has something to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fat chapter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the adults for their reward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way for Fangxiong to be hot, and the book is good to have a reward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xiaotang246 rewarding the Nine Fish 100 starting point book This book is great!
