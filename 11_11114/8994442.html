			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 165th chapter of the Spirit (5)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, not only The distance of the house was inexplicably stretched. The light became even more dim before they noticed. The half-open door was gone, and the whole building was enveloped in a gray-black crystal dice. The elves and Kremar, as well as the thieves' eyes, can see things in a dark and gloomy environment, but now they see that everything seems to be covered with a layer of dirty yarn, nothing can be seen. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let people feel more clearly that the difference between the outside and the outside is the dust that accumulates under the feet. The dust that should be dry and light becomes damp and heavy. The unnatural coldness is like climbing up along their warm body, making them feel like they are burying in the harsh winter when the surface layer has frozen a thick layer of frost or thin ice. The air in the mud floats like silk, but when you want to catch them with your eyes or hands, they disappear like a torn haze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things they are familiar with, like the warriors on the ground, please craft craftsmen to make a subtle mosaic painting for themselves, cut into countless The two horses in the honeycomb-like piece of stone are as big as a real horse. It is like a white horse and a black horse. As the well-known, the god of battle, Tampas, is on the battlefield. When riding on such twins mounts. The barbarians in the north and many warriors, the knight's faith belong to this powerful god of birth and battle, but like other gods, only Tampas-recognized followers can use his holy emblem, while other reverence The person who looks at him usually uses a certain symbol closely related to him in costumes or decorations. Tampa's holy flower silver gladioli and his mount. The white horses and the black horses are the two symbols that warriors often choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the clerics of Klamo, see this symbol more than once in other places, but there has never been a darkness and evil that would have been so vivid. They were originally alive. The stonemason skillfully used the black hornblende to make their eyes, so that they would shine like the living horses with the wisdom of the light, and the mane behind their necks fluttered high in the wind that did not exist. Full of enthusiasm; but now. There are only two overlapping bones under their feet, the cheekbones are towering, the mane is like a dried worm, the eyes of the black hole are full of resentment, their mouths are slightly open, like black blood flowing out, but when people carefully When I went to see it, it was only the illusion caused by the missing hexagonal small stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real image, illusion. Pillars, walls, domes, stairs, they exist, and do not exist, when people move, they can hear children and women whispering. They stopped and they calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are now following the elves and the pastors of Cranford. The two are in parallel, and the distance between the front and rear companions is only the distance that can be touched by extending the arm. The position of Kerry Ben Glan and Kremar is changed again. They are no longer the companions of the past. When the priest Gülen wanted to raise an objection, the burly clerk of Ke Lanwo immediately gave him a look, and the thief immediately closed his mouth. He still remembers that he was carrying the curse of the god of death. Gülen didn't know if he already knew that he had killed a priest of death, but it was not difficult to guess. The god of death is a miser. He rarely gives blessings, and the curse is the same. He will not spend his mind on a mortal for no reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief does not know when he enters the church. The priest who was thrown out by the cleric, but was blocked by the mage, he only knew that he absolutely did not need to squat on it. He had enough "reward" from this group of dying people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He puts his foot on the light, moves forward cautiously, and gently touches his body, the thin silver string is securely Wrapped around his waist, hidden in the robe of the thief, when Ge Lan guessed whether this was a threat or a help, the Elf Ranger walking in front of him took a step forward, which was only a small step. But in a blink of an eye, his back was shrunk to only a third, and the thief's pupil tightened nervously. He rushed out without thinking, but it was too late, and the road ahead of him was like A piece of broken glass shattered, his feet suddenly lost his cuddling, and the whole person fell down uncontrollably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gullan gave a sharp shout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he saw the silver flashing, he was caught, his back hurts like an axe, but he is safe and sound, one end of the silver string It was a help to entangle him, hang the thief in the dark midair, and the other end to the unpredictable distance. Gülen confirmed, because he had seen him below, and he was only ten feet away. The sea of ​​worms, the white worms, and the wings that can be described by the vastness, look like dozens of times more termites, their eyes are shining, rubbing the typical chewing mouthparts, and there are bursts of The sound of the rhythm of the rhythm, surging in the waves of the feet of the Mask believers, is ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Termites should not include humans in their recipes, but Gram does not want to be the first page on their new recipes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief’s legs clasped the rope and tried to bring himself in. His approach seemed to provoke dissatisfaction with the strip that was subjected to eternal activation. It trembled fiercely and almost threw Gülen into the sea of ​​insects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, no, no..." The thief shouted: "Please don't, dear, please don't just want to relieve your burden... ...if you don't want me to do that, okay," he cautiously rushed back, "as you wish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rope squirmed, thieves I only felt wet on the back, he prayed to Mask (although Mask rarely ignored a loser), but Gülen never thought about testing the tolerance of the thief's god and even if he turned to Ma The enemies of Skeel prayed, and they really responded, poor Kramow, poor Ilmot, they could not save even their own believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan only hopes that the curse of the god of death will not come at this time, even if the mage’s rope can’t hold a bunch of powder. He didn't want to wait for him to get together again. When he opened his eyes, there were countless big bugs biting each part of his own.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Mask Occasionally, it would be so kind, the thief’s waist tightened, and then he was happy that he was being pulled up and he was pulled to the ground. Gülen turned around and looked around. He is now in a room like a small living room. It is like being abandoned by humans for hundreds of years. Carbonized silk and decaying wood are everywhere, and one of the thieves The foot is inserted in the hole in the floor. The hole doesn't look like it can accommodate a person like him. He puts his own feet, and the hole is healed in front of his eyes. Those are faintly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Gülen said seriously to the rope: "You are the most beautiful, toughest, smartest rope in the world." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a surprise for him. As the rope is gradually shortened, the other end of the rope appears in front of the thief and there is an Ilmot. Priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s almost better than Kreimar, but better than Kerry Ben or Cranford’s pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't say anything wrong," Gülen nodded to himself with satisfaction: "I am always right, are you right, rope?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&& <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich’s loss of contact with others is only a matter of moments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is inexplicable. The huge force was thrown into a courtyard. Before he got up, he broke a wand and stored a spell that could avoid the effect of the plane. The undead who had been attacked began to look around and see the situation. At his feet is a sticky, moist soil, mixed with dead branches and leaves, and surrounded by dense shrubs and vines, all shrubs are as tall as arbor, spikes like cockroaches if not the caster wears the white The short robe must be stabbed. The vines, which are as dense as curtains, sway slightly in the wind where they don't know where they are. The tip is tilted up and tentatively swaying like a snake and a noose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich lit a small flame. The vines retreated backwards, and even the thorns opened a narrow path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who used to think that they are so vulnerable, "an invitation." He whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked along this narrow path, the strange thing is that he gradually felt that the courtyard of the warrior is not so big, nor will it With so much luxury, he has seen dozens of expensive plants like gold or gems. They are not poisonous or some kind of magic material. He even saw a few clusters of devil fingers growing next to a small depression. White to mature crimson. Finally, he saw a statue of an obsidian statue of a dragon, a huge body covering nearly half of the lich's field of vision, wings folded on the side, hypertrophy The abdomen is covered with layers of bright scales. It has its head lowered, and the bifurcated bifurcations twist backwards and spurs into the sky. The fangs stick out from the mouth, and its eyes are rare golden yellow stones, scattered. Like the real dragon, there is no cruel light, and the thin diamond-shaped pupil is like a space gap that will completely devour everything in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead who once stood still suddenly, he remembered, here is his father’s royal palace, where he lived for 14 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baldwin woke up again, his throat tumbling violently, he wanted to vomit, but he knew that he would vomit only his internal organs and blood, he was rot, this could not be reversed, Il The therapeutic potions sent by Mort's priests can only slightly delay this disadvantage. He has learned from the pastor that his companions have gone to the source of the disease for him and other people in Dormy, who may succeed or fail. The priest of Ilmot had vaguely reminded him that if they failed, then it would only be possible to fight the fiery flames, no matter how stubborn the disease is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will succeed, Baldwin said to himself, he has an inexplicable confidence in Kerry, and he is not burdened with himself. He sinned humblely, and he redeemed his sins and re-engraved the name of Birdwin Don Clay on Tyre's balance pedestal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps only Bydwin, he thought, he never had this surname, but he can give himself a new surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still a person to visit you," said the priest of Ilmot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you tell me who he is?" Birdwin was a little surprised because he didn't remember how he had anything to do with Doring. He didn't know anyone. In the kingdom of Norman, it is in Thunderbolt, and perhaps there are several cities, like the White Tower. He went to complete the task assigned by the King, but he was not even trained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A distinguished person." Ilmot's pastor suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan? Birdwin first thought of his brother who had no blood relationship, but if it was Dylan, he would not enter the multi-spirit, and Baldwin had some understanding of him. He was a cautious person and would not make it. Such an impulsive thing is whether you want to kill him, catch him or save him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last one is obviously unlikely, and Birdwin sighs. Dylan can open a way for him to escape outside the city of Norman. It is already far from the surprise of the former owner of Thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A noble woman," Ilmot’s pastor encouraged to say: "The daughter of the Norman Pharaoh, the new king's niece," he In Baldwin's unbelievable eyes, he calmly said the name: "His Royal Princess Leona is here for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
