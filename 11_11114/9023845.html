			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After satiety, the men’s laughter quickly became a game-style contest. There were two thieves in the mercenary, a brother, a Nicknamed "long nails", and another nickname "fat hammer" - "long nails" is very in line with people's imagination of thieves, he is thin and tall, fingers are like spider's legs, face is yellow, hand-rough The leather is dirty and greasy, and there are some cracks caused by poor maintenance - and his brother "Pathammer" is completely different. He has three spikes so wide and only one-half of the spikes, if It is not that he has a thick beard. Some people may mistake him for being a halfling, but some people think of him as a dwarf. If he does not speak, what is contrary to his appearance is that the "pathammer" speaks sharply. Fine, like a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of "Pathammer" is destined to be difficult for someone to regard him as a good thief. This is an uncompromising weakness in the face of employers. But in the face of enemies and goals, this is a disguise that has never been better - he often pretends to be a trader, pilgrim or aristocrat, giving them a knife when people are unprepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, it’s just a very common show among mercenaries. Besides 娼妓, their only hobby is gambling. Of course, these are all year round. The desperate walking on the tip always loves to play with some bloody things when they are optional. They don’t use scorpions and cards when they gamble, but they smoke one person and open their palms to the wooden pier. On the plate or on the table, he or others use the dagger to puncture the gap of the palm without interruption. Others sing along with rhythmical songs (sometimes someone deliberately beats the beat to disturb him). Action), the bet is whether this person can poke a song stably; the more bad thing is to put a squirrel or a cockroach into the pants of a bad luck, and then tighten the belt, the bet is See how long he can hold on to be bitten; there is also one of the mercenary members who demonstrate his power or skill to others to deter, intimidate others and ensure their position in the team is not shaken,<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "tossing a coin" is a common "hands-on" trick in thieves - each person takes out a number of copper or silver coins, and when they are closed together, they use a fingertip to play in the air and use The other hand catches, it doesn't matter how love is thrown or how to pick it up. But if a gold coin falls on the ground, others can split the gold coins he took out - this trick can train the thieves' fingers and eyes well, not so boring, and get a small extra income. In the guild where Gülen once stayed, it is often seen that formal members force the apprentices to compete with themselves—that is, extortion in disguise, and throwing the money they have drawn from others into their pockets. I really have a little guy who knows how to win in this game. The next day he will unknowingly cut his fingers and dig his eyes in the middle of the night; some will become weak because of old age. Less thieves will also play this with ordinary people. Many people see that they are trying to compare with them. They are just old eyes with sulky eyes and trembling fingers. They will feel that they will win a lot of pens. In fact, they can still leave a pair of trousers to be regarded as thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spike" is a good player. He can play up to twelve silver coins at most when he is at most. But when he took out the silver coins, he was stopped by their leader. "This is too slow for our guests." He smiled Then, he took out a bag of gold coins and counted twelve pieces in the hands of the "long nails". The "long nails" reversed them, and the gold coins were engraved with the side heads of the old Norman Pharaoh. On the back is a roaring male bear. Baldwin is familiar with this. This gold coin was cast when the king was enthroned. He also received a hundred gifts and prizes, each weighing five. About one ounce, and one silver coin at the same time, but the value is ten times the former - it is smaller than the latter (probably the female index finger and the circle formed by the thumb bending), it is more difficult Capture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Gülen, Gülen only drank a little bit of wine, his eyes were almost as bright as gold coins. So the former paladin threw out his small skin, and the heavy money bag fell to the ground and made a whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan is a bit surprised, he knows that Baldwin doesn't like him. But Gülen was never a fool, he soon understood. In any case, he is a companion to Birdwin, and a worst companion is also worthy of a best enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you think something is wrong," Birdwin grabbed the iron hook and dialed the charcoal fire: "That is what I lend to you, you can Give me interest according to the eleventh law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is too high." The thief said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief perceives the "skin" The muscles trembled slightly, and he turned to smile at the "nale nail." "Who is the first? Or is it necessary to take the length?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The length is long." The leader said that he put a fisted hand in front of Gülen, two The fresh straw stem emerged from his fist and looked like the length of the outside. Gülen pulled out one, the leader opened his palm, and the remaining straw was longer than Grenada’s hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be your first." The leader said to the "long nail", "the spike" nodded and stood in the open space that the mercenaries gave him. In the face of the lush reeds and the bright new moon, so as not to be disturbed by the black shadows, the first gold coin is bounced high, it flips in the air, reflecting more dazzling light than the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leona sat next to Kerry Ben, holding a copper cup filled with water filled with reeds. Before this, the king of Norman in the Highlands had never had this drink. She took a sip of it carefully. Its taste is completely strange, but it is not inferior to honey water or rose tea, although it inevitably carries the plant itself. The unique slight astringency is more representative of the pure sweetness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drink," said Kerry Ben. "It is good for humans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is it a herb?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said the elf: "But I only know that black-footed half-length people will be hot." Chew it, or you can also be a kind of food, but Kreima tells me that it can also relieve the symptoms of body heat and vomiting caused by excessive meat." He looked at Leona, they are more When the spirit is full, the food is abundant, but there are few fresh fruits and vegetables. After the plague has blocked the city, no one dares to approach it. They only eat meat and cheese, and Wine; and although some people were planted with radishes and cabbages in the villages that were ruled by the grotesque, they did not know why. They all appear strangely in a semi-rotating state, and the villagers can carelessly eat them, but for the adventurers, even Baldwin and Gülen have no courage to smear the group. The bad things are put in your mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karyben can certainly ask the plants to help out a little fruit in advance. But they have six people, those little fruits can only be said to be some of the embellishment between the hard bread and the dried meat. In terms of vitamin supplements, it is simply a drop in the bucket - before encountering the caravan, except for Kerry Ben and Kreima, everyone else began to appear unevenly with dry eyes and bleeding gums. The lips are cracked, restless and other symptoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said Leona. "He is a caster and the caster is always knowledgeable."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has a good mentor." Kerry Ben said that the shadow cast on his side suddenly swayed. He turned his eyes slightly and noticed that Mei Mei was walking away. I thought she just didn't want to stay with Leona too much, but he immediately saw the young mage who had been wrong in the previous battle. He showed Fro's pastor a gold chain adorned with three gold coins. And after she came over, she hung it directly on her neck - the elf looked back a little, and there was never a follower of Fro in his previous team. Mei Mi’s practice was in line with Fro The doctrine of the doctrine, he does not have the power to interfere with and block their transactions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage who came to find Mei Mi is not handsome, but it is very clean. When she laughs, she has a kind of innocence that is very appealing to women. We said that he is very young, between teenagers and youth, but for Woman does not seem to be as strange to his spell book. He gently pinched the plum, and Fro's priest pouted, but did not refuse, and the heavy weight on his neck seemed to be directly in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now?" Mei Mi asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." The young mage said, "When my tutor is asleep, I will come to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can't be done," Mei Mi said. "I and Liona sleep in a tent. She is a vigilant warrior. Maybe you just jumped into the tent and she will jump up and use her. The flame-shaped sword cuts your little neck," she said, stroking the caster's neck scornfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too wet outside.” Young Master frowns: "I will cast a spell to let her fall asleep, even if the feet of the gnome dragon bite her chest." She won't wake up," he smiled awkwardly. "And, don't you think that would be more interesting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then I will fix it," said the young mage. "I also have a gemstone ring. The ruby ​​on it is as big as a smashed egg. It will be a copy." Small gifts - if you can really do better than your sisters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei picked up slender eyebrows: "Undoubtedly, I The little bread," she said sweetly: "I will let you climb the peak of bliss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking forward deeply," Young Master Then he paused: "Yes," he said. "Are your ships and tents not being subjected to any protective spells? Or scrolls and runes? I don't want to be small." Everyone is alarmed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially your mentor, Mei Mi said in his heart: "No," she said: "Nothing."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the mercenary suddenly heard a wave of repressed shouts. The young mage and Mei Mi turned around and looked at them. They saw the thief Gülen standing. Under the moonlight and the stars, his hands are like a dexterous bird that flips in the air, so that people can't see their movements. The gold coins that he throws into the air are almost in a line. "One dozen! Fight! The mercenaries are screaming. The previous "spike" score is more than ten, but now that Gülan has surpassed him, he can stop, but more mercenaries are down. Note that he is believed to be able to throw twelve gold coins in a row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he can, then the winner is to take one-third of his bet to him - the leader takes a step forward and is blocked by Birdwin when he wants to throw the last gold coin. As a hunter, Bird Of course, Wen knows that the interval between the two gold coins may not even be inserted into a cocked palm. It is not so easy to find the silk gap to put gold coins into the palm of Gülen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader spread his hands and let out the position. The eyes of the former Paladin and the eyes of the thief briefly looked at each other for a moment, and the height of the gold coin was suddenly raised. A few inches, just as the last gold coin was able to leave Gülen’s right hand, a gold coin thrown by Birdwin had already reached the hands of Gülen, and the thief did not hesitate to pop it up when it was added to the loop. Immediately shouted loudly: "One dozen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A dozen!" The mercenaries echoed and shouted, and Gülen immediately waved his hands. With the crisp sound of Ding Zang, a dozen gold coins were picked up into the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This trick is really good." The young mage said scornfully: When he was ready to leave, he noticed that Mei Mi still stood still: "You are not prepared Returning to the boat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will wait." Mei Mi stroked the gold chain: "Reassured, I will return to the tent before the Galaxy crosses the middle of the sky." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan saw Meimi, she stood in the shadow of the reed boat. There was a gold chain on the neck, and the thief went back. His show has been performed. Now he is the mercenary leader and Birdwin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior’s previous fights were not as fancy as the thieves’ tricks, they just tried to test each other’s strengths – although Baldwin had one less hand. But his power can still compete with the leader, but this situation has not been maintained for too long. After the leader gained a slight advantage, the leader took the lead in releasing the former Paladin and vigorously tapping his shoulder in an extremely rude manner. And straightforward language praised him as a brave and strong good man - only they know that the advantage of the leader is not their own, but why should Badwin compete with such a mercenary, he does not want Become the leader of the mercenaries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you, hey, man. Come together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan raised his head He doesn't think there is anything else that needs to be done by himself. Then he smells a rich wine, not the smell of blood and red wine with a suffocating and metallic taste, but a more clear and bright one. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Winter wine?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," said the leader. "It’s my possession. Today is a good day. I am willing to take it out and share it with my friends." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can't drink more wine," Birdwin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How much winter wine do you think I will bring," said the leader. "A bottle! Come on, don't twist like a woman. Drink." When we are finished, we can have a good night's sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thieves saw the pyroxene powder that had not been evaporated and was evenly spread by the mercenaries. On the moss, they laid a dry reed on top and built a leather tent on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you not going back to the boat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have been staying inside "A mercenary said that the two-footed gnome dragon ruined a boat. The calm of the casters is not allowed to be disturbed, Leona and Plum are women, and Birdwin, Gülen, and Carreben and the owners of the caravan share a boat, the remaining mercenaries, businessmen and apprentices. Can only be squeezed again. They almost have to sleep together and overlap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan was released after drinking a cup, and he shared a tent with the "Pathammer" and two other mercenaries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last bit of calories from the pyroxene powder came from below, the tent was dark and warm, and the leader could say that it was immediately screaming loudly, Bird closed Got on the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&&;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magical Star River traverses the Scorpio, the young mage gently falls on the plum and Leona shared the reed boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again observed the ship of Kremar, the ship was dark and the tent was closed - he smiled invisibly, and the plum had already opened. At the corner of the cowhide tent, he made a urging gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young wizard sneaked into her tent dexterously and silently, without any clumsiness between the movements, he swept across the tent, a corner of the tent There is a neat wooden box with a fluorite-plated brooch for illumination, and a sac in the other corner (probably the priest’s, he thinks), with a gap between the tents Rolling a beautiful silk carpet, he could hear a slight breath on the other end of the silk carpet. Plum put his finger on his lips to indicate that he was quiet, then climbed to the side of the silk carpet and slowly opened a small corner. The young mage saw a red-red hair slipping out of the braided blanket. He immediately raised his hands and sang a spell in a low voice. Some rose petals fell from his hand - the cockroach seemed to move, but It was too late, the spells worked, and the young mage listened, and the breathing became heavy and long, indicating that the person being cast had fallen asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Maymi asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s easier than you think." The young mage said easily: "Okay..." He turned back and said with a bad heart, "Now There is only you left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We." Mei Mi said that she didn't even notice anything wrong. She stood up and uncovered her body. The cloak - she only wears such a cloak, and the smooth skin exudes light like a moon or pearls in the fluorite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young wizard is indeed attracted. But he still stood in the same place, but his eyes were uncertain, as if he couldn't make a decision right away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good guy," Mei Mi raised her arm. A beautiful gesture of yawning: "What are you waiting for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wonderful, trembling part lets the caster give up the original plan, using It didn't take long for him to think that he had not been happy with Fro's pastor for some time. Even if she found out what could be done, everyone knows that Fro's pastor is only good at the lowest level of healing, and many of them can't even smoke a smog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked toward Mei Mei and grabbed her arms and neck rudely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While walking away from the belt, it was like responding to the natural call, but because of his sleep on the inside of Gülen, his right foot seemed to be kicked towards the thief's abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quietly waited for the strange and comfortable feeling that the blade penetrated into the fabric, skin, and muscles and conveyed to his toes. But before he had felt the unbearable pain in his ankle, he shouted out, his fingers swiped his waist and pulled out his dagger - he was still thinking about the dagger when he fell to the ground. Can play this role, what method should he use to escape and plead. He had already thought about it before the action, he would urinate on his body, tears flowed, helplessly trembled with a fat, rich sweat infiltrated his hair and clothes, and was smouldered by the hot body to make a scent - There are many people who underestimate and despise him because of his ugly intention. The result is not that he escaped or lost his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also - "I just want to get back the money!" he shouted, and this is where he can't help but feel complacent. Most people will hesitate because of this. Gold coins and money are two completely different concepts. A person who is in the face of an assassin who wants to take his life will be merciless, but it is another story for a person who only wants gold coins - but what he did not think is that the eccentric thief who walked with the paladin Silently, his hard gold dagger broke into the belly of the "pat hammer" and then slipped upwards, cutting open the soft abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pathammer" widened his eyes. The light in the tent was weak. He saw Gülen pounce on a mercenary in the dark. He didn't ask for an inquiry, and he didn't need to answer it. He pierced his chest directly, and the mercenary didn't even have time to pull out his knife. The second mercenary waved his flail in time, but his night vision ability was much worse than that of the thief. The thief raised the mercenary who was smashing and dying to block his attack. Then the corpse fell, and then the thief's fine gold dagger gently bypassed his neck when he wanted to see the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a matter of breathing. When Gülen opened the tent and went out, the "pump hammer" was still alive. He was so hard to breathe, he wanted Grab your own wounds, but he is too fat, how can he not catch it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&&<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It's amazing," Kerry said softly. "I remember that Alva did not mention that he has a guest who is a businessman and a mage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "I am also surprised," the owner of the caravan replied in the same peaceful tone: "It seems that you are not unprepared." He glanced at the rune imprint on the elf and looked away. Transferred to the Ranger's longbow, the arrow that is facing him shines with magical light, and the arrow depicts the rune. He didn't find the elf and the magic arrow in the arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar conversation also appeared between Kremar and the older mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Kreima’s reed boat burned at the feet of the two casters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing strange," said the black-haired caster: "The new king of Norman and the princess of Grand Ante have given an amazing reward. - Even if I feel that the road is too calm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
