			<div id="content"><!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last struggle of Naga was fierce and long, and she almost broke free from the secret silver short sword. Like a snake eager to get rid of the hook, but the soul of the outside world clasped her waist tightly, hugging her in her arms like a close lover, her claws behind the black hair caster The back of the back left a deep visible bone scar, the lich knows that their body has a lot of blood, but now they are in the rushing and muddy water, no one will find those little secrets of the sparkling - Naga's body It was finally completely relaxed, but the black hair caster did not discard it in the rapids. He cast a spell that allowed him to walk on the water, but it was a bit difficult - if it was a calm water, this spell allowed the spell to be cast. It is like walking on a solid earth, but if the water is not calm enough or is in a state of turbulence as it is now, then walking on it is like walking on quicksand or smooth mirrored ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple of the East Crown is located on the west side of the volcano, facing the sea. As we said, the lowest part of the entire building is the trestle and the pillar hall. Upward is the lord's son and close friends, and the court where he hired the mages and knights. The outer court and the inner court are separated by a double wall, both to defend the enemy and to avoid those beautiful and young female slaves being rude. In the dark, the temple of Talos is hidden deep in the inner court, and the lord has no fixed dormitory. He has 120 rooms, connected by slender corridors, each room is decorated with grandeur, brightly lit, and There are three to four female slaves who are only wrapped in tulle, and each night the lord sits on the soft sedan chaired by the eunuchs, quietly marching in the deep corridor, and choose any one of them if they want, if there is a thief. Or if the Ranger intends to assassinate him, then he must first find the latter in this hundred and twenty rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to say whether this has played its due role, but for centuries, no lord was killed in his bedroom, not to say They will be dead, even if there are no tricky enemies. Their sons will also grow up. Of course, the current lords don't have to think about it. Everything is destroyed by the anger of Talos. The tsunami reached a maximum of one thousand feet. This height is almost flush with the towers on the double walls. They push open the delicate windows and doors, split the walls and open the roof. Countless gold and silver vessels, tapestries and ornaments, as well as eunuchs and slaves, were crushed in the gray-blue tides - they ravaged the human temple and roared away. The wreckage, the body and the sand, and some things that should not appear here, for example, the airship that was hurriedly opened by the gnomes, the leather surface filled with hot air has long disappeared, and the wooden hull is only half of it. But miraculously, it remained basically intact. It quietly squatted over the temple built by the priest of Talos on the first building of the Dragon Fire Island, and the hull was skewed. The gnomes, which were wrapped around the hands and feet by ropes that did not know what to do, were hung outside the boat. They were dead and pale, but the silk on the body became deep and bright because of the soaking of water. When the hurricane whizzed past They swayed violently, and it looked like a child with a bad temperament, a painted doll hanging out of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most indispensable here is the corpse, human, fish, slave, master. From the inner court to the outer court, and from the outer court to the pillar hall, a person who was pressed under the half stone pillar suddenly screamed softly, and he was the second son of the lord. He and his brothers are wearing a rune seal, although they can't be sent out, but at least they can guarantee that they are not hurt by the giant stone rubble wrapped in the tide, or they are killed alive, just stored in The power in the rune is also limited, especially the rune seals created by the caster are not that much. Some of them were swept away by the tide at the beginning, so whether they can be rescued in the end depends on whether the god of destiny is willing to cast a smile that symbolizes life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second son has been patient, he does not know whether this disaster is man-made or God’s will, if it is artificial, then it is better not to be one of his brothers, otherwise His ending may not be better than that of Dada - the big eunuch around his father was alone and carrying three times to walk past him and he couldn't help but cry for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you here?” said the eunuch, while laying down his knees, the water left behind and left about three inches of water in the room. His knees were completely submerged, but the eunuch didn't seem to mind, his head was lower than his knees, and he could almost wash his face with sea water. His attitude is not subtle, even with a little humble, not to the lord's son, but to the lord, the second child's heart suddenly flashed a thought, the blood rushed to his face, Even the legs that were pressed under the stone pillars were not so painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the father?" he asked, as much as possible to prevent himself from being too eager and nervous: "What is my dearest master?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is dead," said the eunuch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second child did not count the rudeness of the eunuch. He would rather let him be so arrogant. Anyway, if his father, the owner of the East Crown is still alive, then the eunuch will never add an honor to the answer: "My long brother?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second child couldn’t help but smile: "What about my other brothers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is your seven brothers," the great official said earnestly: "They are all dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then say that my father's son is left with me?" The second child asked, of course, those brothers who were slaves were not in them. They were all castrated, and an eunuch could not become a lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't there just you left?" said the eunuch, who lifted his upper body slightly and stared at the face of the second son - this made the surviving The son of the lord felt a little unhappy, but he was not so angry when he thought that he would soon be able to send the old hyena to his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure?" The second child asked, this question is the most critical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm sure." The eunuch said, pulling the bag from behind, the bag was heavy, and the second child was squinting. In his time, a bunch of less decent heads rolled out from the inside, the first one was his eldest brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second son opened his mouth and he noticed that the head of the head was very flat (after the blood was washed away by the sea), he looked at the eunuch I found that I couldn't see a strange look from that face. He wanted to beg, but his throat was like being blocked by his tongue. A little sound could not be made. The eunuch grabbed his hair, and the dagger pierced the neck of the second son, and continued to descend after cutting the artery and trachea. Cut the cervical spine, turn the wrist, and cut off his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small bug flew out from behind the second son, and the eunuch grabbed it and stuffed it into the chest of the chest. This little insect is the creation of the red robe. It is used to find blood relatives. The more straight the line is, the more accurate it is. The warlocks often use it to remove the roots to ensure that their enemies will not resurrect. The eunuch does not have that power and identity to own it, but The lord has, like the rune seals used to protect against various injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The column hall and the trestle bridge no longer exist, and the thousands of wooden stakes that were originally fixed in the shallow sea have long since disappeared, and the people bound to it Jier and Dada are sitting in the sea in a dull manner. I don’t understand how I escaped from this catastrophe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a big sergeant." Dada said affirmatively: "He caught me, I remember I saw his face."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is firmly holding Jier, perhaps for this reason, Jier and he are alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do we want to escape?" Jier asked, she and Dada did not know what happened after the second tsunami, but in their thoughts, the lord should be able to survive, he wear so many Rune Jewelry, there are casters who can fly and transmit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one needs to escape," the eunuch said behind them. The two men shuddered and jumped up: "I am so glad that you are still full of energy," the eunuch said with a smile. "The things behind are quite laborious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;姬And Dada stared at him guardfully. If there were soldiers beside the eunuch, they would not run back without a head. If they are caught, there is only one death waiting for them, and it is a very painful and miserable death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eunuch did not have too much explanation. He raised the bag from behind and poured all the things inside on the ground. The volume of the heads of several adult males is not small. However, some of them were broken up, but they were still recognizable. The lord was the most deficient, but there is also a child who has been with the lord for several years, even if there are only wrinkles under the eyes or She can recognize the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dada counted his head, "all..." His voice said dryly, and the eunuch immediately helped him: "The lord, and the lord." Sons, almost all here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible? What?” The eunuch smiled. “I am just an eunuch. But I have been preparing, seeing, there is a saying that opportunities are always reserved for those who are prepared. I have seized this opportunity.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xi Xi? Or South..." Jier said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not that stupid," the eunuch interrupted her unceremoniously. "I want to live, and live comfortably, if there is The lords of other islands ruled the East Crown. Didn't he have his own eunuch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jier wants to say that the eunuch is deeply favored by the lord, but no one is better than She knows how terrible it is to be in control of life and freedom, so she keeps her silence wisely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the lord thinks he is good to me," said the eunuch: "And if he dies, the new lord who takes over will kill me directly, my Life and he can be said to be linked, like other eunuchs. Although we were all brothers and castrated by the guy, they and I just want to live - but there is always life. In many ways, if there is a better way to live, we will always choose the latter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You chose... my master?" Dada asked: "But he is a caster, and he is only a disciple of the son of the lord, Beavis, not a parent. If you want to support him in the position of the lord, Longhuo The lords of the islands may be able to raise objections."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not him," the eunuch said calmly: "He is not a dragon fire island, never a He is leaving, I know very well," he said with a strange and happy look: "I chose, Dada, it is you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Dada had thought for a while that she had an illusion: "Wait!" he cried. "You should know that I am an eunuch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah... ..." The eunuch said calmly: "What about that?" He looked through the pile of heads and looked for the ground to pick out the head of Amos, carrying it close to Dada's face, the face of Amos. Miraculously kept intact, it was two identical faces: "Is there anyone else, or can you test the body of a lord?" It has the same face as Amos, no, you are Amos, it is time for him to pay you back," he said, grinding the face of Amos into the sand and grinding it a few times. The flesh and blood are blurred. "You, our new lord, I believe that the owner of the side island will be very happy to hear this news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your partner is him." Dada, or Amos said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a good object," the eunuch said with a smile, his smile has never been so sincere: "He is kind and gentle, but needs to do When making a decision, I can also act decisively and be cautious. "There is extremely sharpness and sharpness. He only met with the eunuch once, but when they met for the second time, they almost reached a preliminary agreement, and the completion of this will be everyone. (The priest of Talos is also included) The plan to use it is only a few months. "What do you think? He is a good man, Amos, a kind person, the elf around him is a believer in Su Lun, There is a former paladin...Fro's pastor and thief may be neglected, but they are not quite like evil people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And his Soldiers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant nodded: "A pretty brave and powerful soldier," he said. "And the old man is dead, the new master is standing, Amos." Those soldiers and mages will obey your orders, and what they want is nothing but gold. Only, as is the hand pay in their hands, they do not care "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
