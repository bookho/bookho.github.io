			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very generous condition... Klein couldn’t believe his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the most valuable sequence 5 extraordinary features and effects of special and powerful seals belong to each other, but the rest is not bad! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong one of the sequence 5 cannot have only seals from the organization, while the "live corpse" of the sequence 6 and the "werewolf" of the sequence 7 can Leave one, but also a lot of money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned back and made a reflection, in order to suppress the greed that suddenly appeared in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your conditions are indeed satisfying." He responded with a sentence and asked, "Who is the Karaman Witch? His "Book of Secrets" What is the content of the document?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric has smashed his forehead:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Wu Wang can refer to a high-sequence occupation, and can also represent the outstanding person who controls the forces of darkness, moon, and strangeness. Beyond the strong of the same kind, Karaman is the latter and the former."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was active in the southern continent of the early fifth century and later completely lost his track. Perhaps he was killed by the Church of Death or our hidden organization, perhaps because of his age. Something that is unknown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His "Book of Secrets" includes secret deeds, ceremonies, alchemy, astrology, symbolism, natural interaction, etc. Knowledge, even if the average person gets it, can become an expert in the field of occultism, even relying on its own naturalness without taking the potion. Spirituality, accomplishing a small amount of extraordinary things, um, the price is gradually becoming a mentally ill person, which is a sequela of spiritual unbearable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds very good... ...that's exactly what I need...but this task is not only difficult in itself, but there is still some trouble afterwards. But there is a hidden organization with thousands of years of history... Klein has been indulging for a few seconds, or has chosen the will to obey the heart: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope to give me some time to consider."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a very significant Very dangerous thing, I can't be impulsive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will reply at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning, um, come to my house, you know the address." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the latter sentence that Sharon said, and suddenly he was a little embarrassed and nervous after he finished:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The other party revealed so many important secret messages, even involving their hidden dangers, if this is not the choice to agree on the spot, It will not be directly silenced? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, will they follow me step by step until I make a decision? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then how do I go to divination on the fog! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon wearing a black court dress looked at Klein quietly, no anger in the blue eyes, no doubt, no emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly took out a folded piece of paper from a pocket and unfolded into a rectangle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper is full of orange, with many symbolic symbols, including those that represent the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These symbols and logos enclose a blank area that makes people feel warm and stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw this paper, Klein remembered what it was and put down the hanging heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also from the "Master of Secrets" Rosago, this is a "notary certificate"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the magical thing that belongs to Sharon when the two men assigned the spoils! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale and exquisite Sharon handed the "Notary" to Klein and refined it with words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Promise not to leak the things I just heard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein breathed a sigh of relief, Zheng focused on:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the prompt, he took the "Notary" and pressed the palm of the hand to the blank area, then Discretion: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I promise not to tell others what I have just known from Miss Sharon and Mr. Maric."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he spits out a word and a word, the symbol and magic logo around the notary are lit one after another, all shining bright and warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of everything, the light became a seal-like image, pressed on Klein's palm, and penetrated the past, covering the blank area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warmth flashed away, and Kleinton felt a subtle but invisible connection between himself and the notary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the "eye of wisdom" Mr. Lao's ability to simulate really belongs to the "notary"... He suddenly thought of something in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am fine." Klein handed back the "notary certificate". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon calmly beheaded, no more to say, the indifferent figure quickly blurred, disappeared into the compartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric still suppressed the hidden malice in his eyes, and tapped the wall of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage suddenly stopped and the compartment door opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is driving with a living corpse, the shadow is a waiter... It’s really Maric’s style... Klein, who is open to the eye, has a stunned Take off the cap, press it on the chest, squat slightly, then jump off the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a secluded street around, and several gas lamps have been broken, but no one has repaired it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein first went to the one-room room in the Eastern District and then returned to No. 15 Minsk Street, pretending to do two divinations in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time is whether or not this commission should be taken, once is whether the commission is dangerous and the degree of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the answer to divination, he did not look at it at all, because the "rebel" of the heterogeneous path can be transformed into a spiritual body, directly in contact with the spiritual world, Gaining information, that is, they naturally possess the ability to divination and anti-Divination, so whether Sharon or Steve as the target can make Klein's revelation wrong and deviate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing the divination, he read the newspapers and books step by step, practiced extraordinary abilities in the living room, and then washed and slept, no abnormalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 4 in the morning, Klein suddenly woke up and rolled out of bed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finds the candle, creates a spiritual wall, and quietly holds his own ritual to summon himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he took four steps back and entered the fog, but did not rush to respond to the prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit on the high back chair belonging to the Fool, Klein stared at the surface of the bronze long table, saw the "all black eyes", saw Azick The copper whistle, saw the "Black Emperor" card, saw the image of Russell holding a scepter, a dark, majestic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth suddenly flicked, and Klein stretched out his right hand and flipped the "Big Card" into a face down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes are not seen as net! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the paper-out pen, he took off the citrine pendant and repeated the two previous divinations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the first divination is that the spirit swings in time, not fast or slow, that is, it should accept the commission, but it is not necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling... For a few seconds, Klein remembered a previous guess: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, maybe, any "magician" needs to perform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the name of the potion should be called "magician", not "magician." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to "not doing unprepared performances" is both to prepare and to perform... and this may not be purely in battle The two assumptions of "mobilizing the enemy's attention" and "letting the audience applaud" also require performance as a premise... As long as the method is right, the disguise is good, the hand and tail are handled without problems, and the rose school is hard to find on me. ... Kline’s mind flashed a lot of thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehensively the revelation gained from divination, he quickly made a decision, then leaned on the high chair of the "fool" and looked up at the ancient palace And the endless fog, revealing a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So let us have a grand performance."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, he took the "All Black Eyes" and the Aziz copper whistle, responding to his own prayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Thursday morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krynn who bought the ingredients early, made the homemade Fenerbonet face closer to the noodle sauce, and took it out of the door letter box today. Newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While eating and watching, he got information about extraordinary gatherings from the Beckland Morning Post. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, the tight situation eased, the party was held... Klein smiled and said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When at nine o'clock, he took out the gold-shelled pocket watch, glanced at it, then looked at the unmanned living room, facing the bulging window: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing to help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Conditions are those you said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the premise is, give me another few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused, including Laughing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need to do some preparation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside Klein, no In the living room of other people, a whimsical sound suddenly sounded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "After completing the preparation, you will go to the bar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the study of the Viscount of Greenlint, Audrey sat in a chair, reached out to help Susie sort the hair behind her head, and tasted the Ormill grapes. Fols and Quiet sit next to the rest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you in a hurry to let me come over?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she was the first time after seeing Fols and Hugh after the Lanerus incident, she had already paid her to the other party through Su Shi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, after joining our Tarot meeting, Fols seems to have changed nothing, still lazy, likes to fight, but some things hidden are completely Different, she occasionally appeared decadent, melancholy, and did not seem to have any hope for the future, but now, the performance in this aspect has completely disappeared... "Readers" Audrey smiled and looked calmly inside. The state of the magician "Miss." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falth drinks the rest of the wine road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, Olmer, Sure enough, it is the most well-known wine. It is much better than the one I used to drink. The level is very clear and each level has different feelings.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put down Wineglass Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
