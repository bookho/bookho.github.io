			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, a palace surrounded by pillars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik quickly reported his experience to "Footer". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Dark Angel" Sasrel... The names or titles of these angel kings seem to have been inundated by the long river of history and are almost no longer known. If it weren't for the little "sun", they found it in the land of God's abandonment. If it wasn't directly encountered the ancient evil spirit of the suspected "red angel" deity, I would not even know the king of an angel. At most, I heard that the Amon family But can't go deep into the "God of God"... Where is this "dark angel" now? Is it still alive? Is He still one of the top layers of the “Redemption Rose”? Klein felt a burst of emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afraid of the little "sun" in this regard, asked East to ask West and could not answer, Klein stopped thinking, resting leisurely on the chair: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your dilemma has been lifted, your companion is about to find it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not give the small "sun" a chance to cut off the contact directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the abnormality of the small "sun", if it is discovered how to explain the problem, Klein simply does not bother to remind the other party to make up the reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s strange to appear strangely after disappearing, and it’s not normal to have all sorts of strange situations? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Dairik is very grateful that Mr. "The Fool" did not ask himself more because he was afraid of escaping from the different afternoon town, he would Being exposed to deadly darkness or being hidden by a hidden monster, I urgently hope that I can grasp the current situation of the body as soon as possible in order to make the most effective response. However, if Mr. Fool really raises a question, he will also be serious. And patiently describe the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awareness returns to the body, and Dairik quickly recovers from the senses around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his eyes and saw a candle burning to the bottom. The candle was holding a small group of flames that were swayed by the wind. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, he found that the "chief" did not know when he was standing on his side, tall Heinham and Joshua wearing red gloves One step behind the guard is two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long have they been watching me like this... Although Dairik has already thought of good reasons on the fog, there is still some guilty conscience and tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin’s decree has no expression on his face, looking at Dairik Berg, the voice is as usual: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to you just now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric did not answer immediately, it would seem that he had long been woven He deliberately paused for a few seconds according to the tricks taught by the "downside down man", and he said intermittently as he recalled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Into the basement, I saw the altar, I suspect it was an altar, trying to distinguish the words and symbols left above, and recognized three names, including the "destination angel" Uluos... At this time, the light of the lantern was extinguished, waiting for me to turn back. Looking at the past, Heinham and Joshua were gone. I made the light source, walked out of the basement and found that it was the same in the afternoon, but there were candles in many houses, just like living still. Humans.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I dare not leave this house and return to the ground Room, try to do what I have done before, hehe, chief, in the afternoon town, the text on the altar is complete, there are three kinds, one is the giant language, the other is the dragon language, and I don't know, but the meaning of the first two expressions is the same, the title and name of the three angels, and the 'redemption rose'...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Later, I found myself back here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All he said was true, even complete, just concealing the details of how to return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek did not expect this to be able to survive the "chief", and he had intended to be vague about the other party’s questioning, pushing the reason to an anomaly that he did not understand. on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will definitely make the "chief" doubt, but the "just" man and the "audience" channel of the "audience" approach said that he is not on similar matters. I will ask, I will show an abnormality, but it will make him pay more attention to me, and regard me as a chess piece to balance the Rovirian elders... The world outside is really complicated, I can really understand their ideas recently... Dairik I couldn't help but sigh a few words in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In a harsh environment, there is rarely a similar thing in the past when there is less power in a silver city. Even if there is, it is basically concentrated inside the "six-member council." The first thing that the rest of the extraordinary people learn in patrolling and adventurous is cooperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin gently daggers, walks to the altar, and does all the attempts Delux described, but he did not disappear from the air, still standing in the original Ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the surviving power has fulfilled its mission." The "hunter" whispered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t want to make up my reasons... Dairik is a little shy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin thought for a moment and looked at Dairik:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Medic What is the title of Sasliel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red Angel and Dark Angel." Dairik did not hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin seems to nod and think lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In that few books, There is a mention of 'red angel', but there is no specific name. As for the 'dark angel' Saslier, it has completely disappeared into the long history."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dairik was trying to ask the rest of the king of angels, and suddenly saw the candlelight at the entrance to the basement faint, as if there was a shadow from the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Leave here first." "The Demon Hunter" Colin is also aware of it, cautiously said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek carrying the "Hurricane Axe" immediately approached Heinham and Joshua to form a battle formation with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when he took a step, he found that Heinham had retreated two meters to the side, and Joshua lifted the left palm of the red-red glove. The faces of the two men are unprepared defenses, and the eyes are full of meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick knows that their response is normal, because there are corresponding teachings in the relevant courses of exploration: more observations, less observations for companions who have just left the strange situation contact! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I still can’t figure out how it got out of that strange afternoon town... Dairik opened his mouth to explain, but closed his mouth silently . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was ashamed and aggrieved, clung to his lips, carrying the "Hurricane Axe", turned to follow the "Chief" side, and left the basement step by step. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of four quickly came to the door and prepared to go out, but suddenly saw the dark afternoon of the building outside the town seems to have become a bit darker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost instantaneously, different windows in different houses, one after another, reflected in a candlelight, dim light or interval or connected, quiet And silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not stay on the fog for too long, returning quickly In the bathroom, the corresponding items were put away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that there will be no more accidents in the small 'sun', or else it is not very good to go into the bathroom frequently. People who know it understand that this is hiding. Secrets, if you don't know, you might think that there is a problem with the German Sparrow prostate. This is simply ruin!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although I have thoroughly digested it 'No Face Man' potion, but 'Secret Master' Rosago is also a sequence of a sequence of upgrades, and his extraordinary features must also contain a 'no face' potion... with this extraordinary feature As the master material, I am equivalent to drinking a bottle of 'no face', a bottle of 'magician', a bottle of 'clown', a bottle of 'divination', and even more...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, the various rules that were summarized before are still to be observed as much as possible to digest these extra ingredients." Klein made the water, washed his face, and walked out of the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just thought about whether he was going to dinner time, and he was planning to take out the gold-shelled pocket watch and look at it. His eyes suddenly darkened and he could barely see the five fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s night again... This interval is very irregular... If you encounter monsters, the two sides are fighting, and the day is dark, what should I do? Monsters are also creatures, they should also sleep, otherwise the big probability will disappear in the night... Oh, the two sides lie down while playing, sleep, wake up to continue... Is this really not an unspeakable story below the neck? ? After a successful promotion, Klein, who was more relaxed, spoke two words and walked to bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
