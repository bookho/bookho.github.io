			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stoun University...Associate Professor Michel...notes from the 20-year war...Audrey extracted the keywords in the discourse and aimed Su Shi, who was running happily in front of the Hummer, asked directly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms. Simin, what kind of note is this?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't know, only know that it belongs to the Twenty Years War, is a collection of Associate Professor Michelle, it has an important feature is that on the cover The lines of the vagueness constitute a dragon." Smin did not make any concealment, and originally gave all the information he had. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shen quietly listening to her telling Audrey while restraining the red horse, she has already thought about how to accomplish this task in her mind:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not too difficult to visit Associate Professor Michelle to visit his collection and make a purchase request for one of them.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it’s not very pleasing to admit, but in any case, he may not be too big to reject me, hey, Audrey, don’t rely too much on these...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The biggest problem with doing this is Turkic. I didn't know Associate Professor Michel before. It's hard to explain why I suddenly wanted to visit him, and I don't know what the note meant to him. The rush to make a purchase request may bring vigilance and alertness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Jane’s brother studied at Stowe University, and at the last meeting, it showed I like the characteristics of telling and talking. If I invite their brothers and sisters to participate in afternoon tea, and guide the topic to history, test And collections, he should mention Michelle, Associate Professor, uh, people within a university, be called a collector's certainly not much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With such a prelude, I can send someone to visit Associate Professor Michel, ask for a visit to the collection, and then try not to be the first time Expressing the need, observing the performance of the owner, and guiding him to show the truest attitude, which helps me to make the appropriate request in the right way at the right time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After determining the idea, Audrey pointed to the female pastor Simin, and said with a smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will try my best, but I don't guarantee success. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, her legs tightened, the horse was clipped, and the whole man ran out like an arrow, rushing to a circle in the hunting circle Red-brown fox stalking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rough sea, the "Blue Avenger" is like a piece The leaves that were blown into the air by the wind, sometimes thrown away, sometimes fell, but maintained an amazing balance, without any signs of overturning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the captain's room, Alger Wilson floated on the window, staring at the waves like mountains at the top, and the wind was silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, he fell and stepped on the carpet with his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The Winder' is really a sequence that can be played simply by name. The only problem is that you must occasionally make yourself violent to meet the wind. Characteristics..." Alger said with a smile in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than two months, he has not obtained the formula of "Ocean Singer" through his own channels and transactions in the Tarot Club. After all, this belongs to the sequence. 5, is the closest level to the demigod, the corresponding formula has appeared in the market without price, even if there is a pile of money, and willing to pay a lot of money, it is difficult to buy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, joining the corresponding church or organization is the most effective way to get a similar formula, but Alger, the bishop of the Storm Church, can’t rely on this route because Some secrets, he must conceal his own strength, change the freedom of action and the weakness of monitoring, so that after having enough confidence, go to a place and complete the purpose of waiting for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes him happy is that he has not wasted two months, at least the digestive progress of the "Winners" potion is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The Winder' is simple, 'The Ocean Singer' is said to have no small difficulty... Do you have to sing often?" Alger couldn't help but turn around , looking to the deck position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a room, he can still hear the drunken sailors sing there and create noise that can be compared with the sound of the storm. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger did not consciously frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Jowood, Cynthias Circus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms., aren’t you performing tricks? Why do you wear them like this?” A teenager asked incomprehensibly wearing a black pointed hat in front of him and wearing the same color. Woman in a skirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why I wear this, maybe it was the earliest time, my head was frozen by the cold weather, and then it was fixed into a style... Buddha Erss touched the face covered with red butter, and smiled and responded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In ancient times, tricks were often misunderstood as witchcraft."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this has nothing to do with why I wear it... She picks up one of the three large ceramic cups in front of her and folds the white ball down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, she quickly exchanged the position of the cup and laughed at the teenager who had just asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Guess which cup is the ball in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't this one of the gambling methods invented by Russell the Great?" The boy said with great interest. "But you are not a dealer, it is the master of the circus, so I guess the ball has been replaced by you, all the cups are empty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Fols smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, the answer was wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She slammed the cup in the middle, and the cock flew out of the white figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a pigeon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the original ball is where the pigeons leave! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"very exciting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a sigh of praise, Fols looked at the church bell not far from the room, grabbed the props, and returned to the tent where the head of the circus was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really want to resign? I can double your salary!" The head of the circus greeted him and said quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, I summed up the 'Master of the Master of the Master' in mid-March, and last week I completely digested the potion, if it was not signed today. I haven't come yet...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it feels good to be a master of tricks, it doesn't stop me from being promoted to the 'Astrology', the teacher said Come over this week, give me recipes, materials and a gift... What gift is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the full moon slang is getting more and more horrible. If there is no 'fool', I must have lost control of the monster..." Fols stretched out the right palm Covering his mouth, yawning lazily, then smirking and smiling:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the case, I am actually a best-selling novelist, I am going down The subject matter of this book is related to the circus, so I am here to apply for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Selling novel writer?" The head of the circus is bright and worried. I expected to ask, "Do you write about our bad things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there something bad here? I have lived in these two months. Very pleasant." Fols took off the black pointed hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the circus reveals a heartfelt smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wall, Ms. Wall, Can you mention the name of our circus in the book? I will, I will give you advertising fees, of course, not too much, you know, I have to raise a lot of people."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can it still be like this? The head of the team is very brainy... For the first time, Fols knows that novels can also be "advertised" in the same way as newspapers and magazines, and the form is more subtle and more natural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the waves are undulating, passenger ships with rows of artillery on both sides travel on safe waterways and do not dare to deviate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the east of Olawe, once deviated from the correct route, it often means missing, even the pirates do not dare to stay away from the safe area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ocean is full of unexplored areas, full of all sorts of sensational legends! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than two months of volunteering, Klein, who found four real opportunities, bid farewell to the work of lifting the patient, brushing the toilet, cleaning up the vomit, and boarding Boats to the Gargas Islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He successfully hired the "hidden" Jia Delia in a separate dialogue at the Tarot Conference in early March, and will be in the capital of the Gargas Islands. The city of Nass, who meets with the other side, takes the "Star Admiral" vessel to the almost unreal dangerous sea in the easternmost part of the Sea of ​​Sonia, looking for the wild mermaid that lives there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "hidden" Jia Delia appeared to be interested in the reality of the members of the Tarot Club. At that time, she only thought for a few seconds and agreed to "the world." "The request, but based on the degree of danger, she opened a relatively high price: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3000 pounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s first reaction was to give up and turn to the ghost ship of Mr. "Right Man", but considering that the latter followed the sailors of many storm churches. Not so free, and the danger to the easternmost part of the Sea of ​​Sonia is indeed high, and finally agreed to the request of Ms. "The Hidden", who will wait for a month near the Gargas Islands from the beginning of April. If the time limit is exceeded, the cooperation will be suspended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to waste a deposit of 1,000 pounds, Klein did not wait for the digestion to be completely completed, and proceeded from Orawi Island and went straight to the Gargas Islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, with the previous summary and the opportunity to play it, he is very close to the thorough digestion of the "No Face" potion, even if it is no longer true. Play and continue to be in the capacity of Galman Sparo, and it can be completed in two or three weeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, plus the "world" identity has been tied to the German Sparrow, so Klein has returned to the hospital after leaving the hospital And a strong adventurer, but there is a certain "disguise." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the undulating sea level outside the cabin, Klein finally saw the port city with white rock as the main material of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The easternmost colony of the Fossac Empire, the capital of the Gargas Islands, Ness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is finally going abroad..." Kline looked at a fishing boat carrying whale flesh into the port, and the rough feeling was like a substance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he found that many ships flying the Jolly Roger were parked at the port without any avoidance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the east of Olawe Island is a paradise for pirates... Klein wears a hat, puts baggage, and after the passenger ship stops, walks out of the cabin, along The ladder enters the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps, he saw a group of pirates suspected of having a conflict with the local gang. The two sides took out their weapons and squeaked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein calmly passed by, without any thought of stopping. At this moment, he saw a suspected local guy pull out a few cans from his pocket, open the lid, and throw it at the center of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does this mean?" Klein almost laughed and immediately thought of a famous item on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canned fish! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canned fish canned in the east coast of Fossac, the Gargas Islands, etc.! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts just emerged, and the indescribable stench smelled into Klein’s nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face twitched a few times, forcibly endured the discomfort of the body, and quickly left the area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirates who were attacked vomited on the spot, and the rest hurriedly dragged their companions to escape, as if they lost their fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
