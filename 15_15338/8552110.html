			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc. Cake? This is really beyond my imaginary answer... No, if I can guess the answer of the mental patient, wouldn’t it mean that I am almost the same... The thoughts in my mind flashed, and Klein kept a leisurely smile, just like a friend. Just like a chat, ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who wants to send you a cake?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hood Eugen The expression smashed, and the skin became even longer and thinner, crying and saying: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no cake... no cake!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You stole my cake!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice plunged high, his eyes glaring at Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for Klein to figure out how to answer, he slammed his mouth and opened his mouth, revealing two rows of white teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed, he jumped out of his bed and stepped closer to Klein, both hands, trying to grab each other’s shoulders and then dragging the target In front of you, bite heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this sudden attack, Klein was slightly confused, but responded promptly, he bent his knees in an instant, half-squatting, at the same time Turn your waist sideways and raise your left arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hit an elbow on the abdomen of Hood Eugen, hitting each other's eyes white, leaving more saliva in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Hood Eugen did not stop moving, he fell down and opened his arms, to hold the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s body turned and rolled out to the side, familiar as if he had practiced hundreds of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He supported his right hand and stood up in the backfair, intending to turn to attack, swooping up and subduing his opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw that Hood Eugen stood there, his eyes lost focus, and they were empty and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein stunned and looked sideways at the corner, only to see Dunn Smith wearing a black thin windbreaker and a silk hat. Hands and buried his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain dragged Hood Eugen into the dream... He took the action in a dazed manner, seized the opportunity, and took out a ceremony that could not hurt anyone. Silver Jubilee, using it to create a spiritual wall, blocked this single ward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Klein took out three candles filled with mint and placed them on the window sill in an inverted triangle, a symbol of the night goddess, a Symbolizes the mother of privacy, one represents oneself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, he laid out a simple altar and lit all the candles with spiritual friction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he wants to turn back to remind the captain, Dunn has raised his head and smiled low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Hood Eugen's dream is in chaos, there is no way to induce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is not falling, Hood Eugen’s eyes are reunited , no longer empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the mad "psychologist" leaned back and yawned comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein didn’t know what to say for a moment, so he said nothing and picked up the metal vial with the Amanda pure dew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drops the transparent liquid of this night vanilla, deep sleep flower, chamomile mixed and extracted into the flame of the candle representing himself, leaving quiet and quiet The scent instantly emanate and pervaded every corner of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hood. Eugen’s sense of tension, anger and comfort disappeared. He lazily sat back to the bed and looked at him with madness. The blushing moon outside the window, the eyes lost their focal length again, and a piece of peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in this way can he use the "eye of the eye" potion to let Hood Eugen's spirit enter the embarrassing state a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, I was just an unprofessional "psychic"... He thought about it beforehand and took out a tarot card from his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deck has only 22 main cards. The reason is that it is easy to carry. It is the "weapon" that Klein successfully applied for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of it is inlaid with sterling silver and other wires that can harm the dead spirits. The pattern is complex and gorgeous, so Klein only wants to collect I don't want to deal with the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein cuts the card with one hand and smiles at Hood Eugen:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's play cards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Playing cards?" Hood Eugen took his eyes off the window and repeated the word in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not answer, and put the tarot card into his hands with a good intention to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hood. Eugen imitated what he had just done, and cut the card with one hand and successfully completed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The psychiatric patient in this extraordinary person slowly turned his attention to the card with excellent hardness and elasticity and excellent texture, and opened the most surface. The one: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tattered man was tied to his hands and hung up, and his head was in a vague aura. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inverted people... Klein looked down thoughtfully, took the opportunity to get up, took the "Eye of the Eyes" potion, and dripped the amber liquid To the candlelight - still the root that represents his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ethereal scent of wine is filled with people, and people just smell it, and they feel drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hood. Eugen’s expression was a little bit sloppy, his gaze lost his focus, and the tarot cards in his hand slipped onto the bed one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is still sitting steadily, not soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein relies on "meditation" to resist the effects of making his body and soul light, fluttering, and stunned. Another metal vial was rotated to unscrew the stopper and pour the blue liquid inside into the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet Pharmacy"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold liquid flows through the mouth, across the esophagus, into the stomach, and Klein instantly becomes sober, no more embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly vomited, skillfully picked up another essential oil and herbal powder, and dripped into the two candlelights that symbolize the goddess of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the faint mist, he took two steps back and solemnly and seriously shouted in Hermes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for the power of the night;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for hidden power;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I pray for the care of the goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I pray that you will let me and Hood Eugen, the spiritual communication with the extraordinary person around me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of mantra reverberates, and Klein sees the dark color There is "black" in the candlelight to spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not evade, did not resist, let this deep "night" enveloped himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an abnormally awake state, he felt that his spirit was out of the physical protection, and entered the void like the depths of the universe, surrounded by boundlessness. The extreme darkness of the sound, and the sky above the head is full of transparent shadows that are difficult to describe the form. It is a bright and brilliance of different colors and countless knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he thought of it, he saw a sly, a world surrounded by a twilight storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein knows that this represents the spirit of Hood Eugen, which represents his "mental body," and then moves closer to the wall and acts as a wall. In the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, he saw countless glimmers slap on himself, hearing thousands and hundreds of thousands of people whispering about a piece A slang like a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proverb is very confusing, illogical, and the beauty of the beauty is still praised at the moment, and the moment after the toilet is fluent, the moment is crying. After the moment, I started carnival...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crazy thinking storm "pulled the bite" in the spirit of Klein, wanted to assimilate him, but Klein remained absolutely The sobriety and reasoning quickly flew inside the "spiritual world" of Hood Eugen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the horrible proverbs and terrible embarrassment in front of the mysterious space above the fog, this is like a beautiful concert... Klein smirked, penetrated the storm, and saw the sly, transparent and fuzzy Hood Eugen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sequence of 7 "psychologists" kept the appearance of the outside world, eyes looked at me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stopped in front of him and whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know Langer Us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hood. Eugen replied dumbly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light and shadow around it change, as if Hood Eugen opened up the "heart of the sea." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly, the interlaced light and shadow portrays a black-haired brown man with a normal face, a full forehead, round glasses and a sly smile The young man is the Llanus that Klein had seen in the wanted order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein satisfactorily nodded, stabilized the mood, and asked in an induced tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Why did Lalhous come to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said..." Hood Eugen's voice is getting lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he changed his voice to a magnetic voice, and smiled slightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Hood Eugen, this is the worst era and the best era. As long as we can seize the opportunity, we can become the masters of the world and become true immortals!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you help, I will not only tell you how to master the potion power, avoid the loss of control, but also promise to give you a little divinity, immortal deity in the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should see, there is a presence behind me, my promise is his promise, and psychological alchemy will, in a sense, be with Him There is also a certain relationship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't doubt, the psychological alchemy is not strong enough to provide you with enough help unless you are willing to stay in the present forever. Rank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mastering the power of potions and avoiding out of control... How can I use the "playing method" "The feeling of tempting others... Lalhous is really ambitious, and it is only after the sequence 8 that he began to worry about the divine... What secret is there behind him... This guy seems to be planning something Not just fraudulent money... Or, scamming money is just his hobby? Klein heard a lot of thoughts, see Hood Eugen stopped talking, and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of help Lanurus wants you to provide? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hood. Eugen did not answer immediately, and the entire "spiritual world" was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he laughed and replied very confusingly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
