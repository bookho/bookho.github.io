			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Hellmo’s answer was heard, Klein’s mouth twitched in an uncontrollable manner and almost stayed in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My enemies are not in Byam... If you die at the door of "Neptune", it will not have much effect... He slowly sucks In a sigh of relief, instead of continuing the topic, I asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hermoshine, no, Mr. Hilary, why did you notice me? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And also specifically reminded me before dying! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also his doubts about "The Mirror" Arrods and the messenger Miss Renet Nikol, but there has been no good opportunity to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hermouch was silent for two seconds across the door, and then said with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Some of your traits are not secrets in the eyes of a few special, high-spirited spiritual creatures. As long as you have been in close contact, you can find them. After all, the fog that symbolizes the great mastery of the spiritual world is in us. Above the head, some unique gods with authority or extraordinary people who represent destiny can also find this in varying degrees. Of course, the premise is that they have been in close contact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gray fog... Although the "orange light" statement is almost identical to the admiration of Arrods, but it has pointed out the fog, this is the first time I encountered someone in front of me to point this out! So, is that mysterious space a remnant of the kingdom of the great masters above the spiritual world? What is the route 0 of this route? The gods who can find me with fog and blessings include the "desire mother tree", so will He target me? Klein’s thoughts were like boiled boiling water, and he was questioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is about to speak, Helmouch has continued to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In the prophecy of 'Yuangguang', the great master above the spiritual world is one of the variables of the end, but I am not sure that you are equal to Him. There are too many possibilities that may give you that kind of trait, for example, His 眷, his children, the gods he chose, but this does not prevent me from expressing my friendship.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, do you know the Beckland Stock Exchange? You are like a railway company that has just listed. It seems to have a good prospect. Some people will naturally be optimistic about you and buy certain stocks. Many people will be very greedy and hope to use other means to occupy the company or obtain a controlling stake. The former is me, the latter is the 'desire mother tree', and it is more powerful spiritual creatures. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way...if it wasn’t for me there was a fog-related traverser, Russell the Great, if not I was in that mysterious space. Divination has its own origins, got a clear picture of the earth, recalled more memories, I will doubt whether I am the reincarnation of the great master above the spiritual world... From the overall experience, I and Russell the Great Closer to the chosen gods... The great master above the spiritual world is equal to the boundlessness of the blessings of life. Klein inevitably produces all sorts of speculations, and the mind is like a ball of wool played by a cat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmed down the mood:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any way to cover up that trait?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Become a god. "Hermoschein just finished answering and suddenly coughed two channels. "Do you mind if I die at your door?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... mind. "Klein didn't want to be noticed by the "God King" Yann Courtman and Admiral Robert Davis and other gods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hermouch Because of the bite, I bite the candy channel:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I have to leave immediately, otherwise it will be too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you become a demigod, you have the ability to explore the depths of the spiritual world, we have the opportunity to meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is silent for a second:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your reminder, Mr. Hilary."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hermosche did not respond, and he walked to the stairs more heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the sound of the first floor downstairs, Klein regained his attention, and suddenly Russell could find the existence of fog but could not enter. Certain guesses:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He recovered the silver medal that led him to cross the long time after becoming an extraordinary person, and when I tried the transshipment ceremony again, it was ordinary people... and, Russell’s choice was the 'commonist' approach, and I It is the 'divination family', and the power of the mysterious space above the fog is obviously helpful to divination.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, the premise of autonomous entry into the fog The condition is the ordinary person or the extraordinary person of the 'divination' approach, and mastered the corresponding spells, rituals and symbols? The Emperor experimented too late, and chose the wrong way, naturally unable to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Based on the fact that 'divination', 'apprentice' and 'stealer' are similar, the latter two seem to be OK, will this happen? It is the great emperor who sighs in the diary the deeper reasons why one of them should be chosen. In addition to the absence of sequence 0, these three ways will not have the influence from the top, but also the key to entering the fog?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking in the rollover, Klein temporarily suppressed this unproven thing, considering the reminder of "Orange" Hilary:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful with the "Desire Mother Tree"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the fact that Admiral Amyrius, Klein was very wary of the "desire mother tree", had to change his identity, and took advantage of the opportunity to hide two Months, the follow-up is even more reluctant to provoke the "blood admiral" and other rose school people, afraid to fall into the trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the potential, great danger, the first thought of normal humans must be to solve it, Klein is the same, but the problem is that he has no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Desire Mother Tree" suspected the true god of sequence 0, in the astral world, even if Klein jumped up, he could not beat him, beat him, and he controlled The power of the rose school is a short history organization, it is likely that there are angels sitting in the town, there is a level 0 seal, otherwise they are difficult to survive in the hostility of all the secret organizations of all churches, so Klein even ask Azick Mr. and other friendly big guys can help, and there is no way for the Rose School to be uprooted, and maybe it will be in danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, Klein had to hide and hope to be promoted to Sequence 4 and become a demigod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been careful about the 'Desire Mother Tree', 'Orange Light' Mr. Hilary is not aware that I have encountered this evil god on Olawe Island. Trap?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or, he deliberately came over and reminded that the meaning of this sentence is that the other party will have a big action recently? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... he was controlled by 'blood above', and 'blood above' is a rose school, probably knowing something ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was amazed, not blindly believe that the "faceless man" change must be able to pass the "desire mother tree" look! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the "Orange" Hilary, he can find some kind of trait in my close contact, this is "no face" "Extraordinary ability is difficult to cover up!" He has not acted for so long, is he trying to give this kind of induction to believers by means of certain rituals or artifacts, and has recently succeeded? Klein's brow slowly wrinkled, and the more he thought, the more likely he felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes him more and more want to return to Beckland. In that big city, even angels have to be good, just like a "snake of destiny" In that way, the believers of the "desire mother tree", the strongmen of the rose school, can no longer act with enthusiasm, and can only patiently look for opportunities! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein breathed a sigh of relief and went to the fog, and divination himself was in danger of his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he got the answer no, it is not life-threatening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Klein did not relax, he remembered that the "desire mother tree" interference with divination can penetrate the fog barrier to some extent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a long time ago, his spirituality also prevented him from divining the "Werewolf" extraordinary character on the fog, because it is likely to involve "the god of being bound" And the "Bounded God" is suspected of being the embodiment of the "desire mother tree." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either it’s really okay, I think more, or the danger is very close, so the “Desire Mother Tree” only interfered with it... Be careful, Prepare first, even if it turns out to be a false alarm, it is better to be caught by the rose school, and it is taken by the "desire mother tree" and does not know what to do! Klein immediately returned to the real world, took out the pen and paper, wrote letters quickly, and looked up to "Mr. Azick." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
