Run! Try your best to escape! Even if you use extraordinary ability to expose your true identity, you must run away immediately! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his eyes, the introverted and cold adventurer is a real monster with a human skin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when Daniz was about to start the operation, he suddenly calmed down because he remembered what happened last night:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party did not attack him, let him leave! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, he does not have to hunt my hostility, and can resolve the current crisis through communication... directly fleeing will intensify contradictions... "Daniz's mind turned sharply, relying on rich experience, forcibly controlled his legs, seemingly waiting for the place." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walked step by step to his body and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning We met again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentle and courteous smile made Daniz inexplicably shudder and twitched his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein maintains the setting, the expression turns a little cold:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you do on board?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the Rhodes Islands." Also known as the "flame" of the famous pirates Daniz Honestly replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do there?" Kline asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz laughed: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Awaiting our captain’s order, there may be a mission Arrange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should drive me off the boat, no matter what, a pirate on a passenger ship has potential risks... after that, Niz is guessing the possible development in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pretty good result for him, at the most wasting a ticket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was silent, and the silence of Daniz was creepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After five or six seconds, he opened his mouth again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which cabin do you live in? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First Class, Room 312." Daniz lifted the ticket in his hand to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t dare to look down and feared that the other side had a sudden attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's invisible location is down:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have a servant's room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." "Flame" Daniz made a subconscious decision, but he was very upset and completely ignorant of the meaning of the other party's problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he heard the other party telling his subordinates to say plainly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You sleep there." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at him and spit out a word indifferently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hostage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hostage? He is worried that I am going to board the ship, and it is convenient for the follow-up pirate group to hijack the White Onyx, so I plan to use me as a hostage? It makes sense. If this is the case, even if I am going to disembark, I can’t avoid the attack of the pirate group. It’s better to take the personal qualities and facilitate the negotiation... Shit, I hate this arrogance and indifference. The guy who speaks always says only one or two words, or half a sentence, and the rest must guess by yourself! If, if not, I will not communicate with this guy! How did I feel that his temper was right for my appetite? I must be crazy... Daniz’s teeth are itching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." He sighed helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to your cabin." Klein maintains the perfect Galman Sparo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling... "Flame" Daniz carries the suitcase and reluctantly leads the sleazy monster into the cabin to the upper level. Arrived in 312 rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After opening the door, Klein quickly glanced at it and felt that it was many times better than the second class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living room is about 30 levels, connected to a master bedroom and three servant rooms, with separate washrooms, standard closets and desks made of mahogany . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz put down his suitcase and looked at the servant’s room, suddenly thinking of a very important question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "So let the master bedroom be empty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice just fell, already know the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to me." Klein said with a polite smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, in order to guard me... Daniz was depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stepped on the carpet in the room and pointed to the door:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow me downstairs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...good." Daniz was a little confused and didn't know what the other party wanted to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of adventurer and well-known pirates quickly arrived in the second class area and found the original room in Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After opening the door, Klein did not go in and pointed to the inside of Daniz: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Pack up the things on the table and put them in the box."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? pack? Can I help you clean up? Daniz is almost stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, he only felt a raging rush to the top:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, "flame "Daniz, the fourth sailor of the "Iceberg Lieutenant", a well-known pirate with a reward of 3,000 pounds, how can it be driven by a servant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dignity, my reputation, does not allow me to accept such insults! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sees the "flame" Daniz incarnation stone carving, standing there motionless, so he gave him a cold look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz’s body trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a breath and smiled bluntly than crying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bent down into a room that was not too tall, and he put the items scattered outside into the suitcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without Kline’s reminder, he’s placed very neatly, more than his own baggage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, he always had the urge to attack the other side, but eventually he was patient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Room 312, Daniz bit his teeth and swallowed saliva:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you call you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German Sparo." Klein responded succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German Spalo...Daniz chewed the name in his heart and vowed never to forget today’s encounter, and he must let the other party taste it in the future. To a similar taste! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain will definitely help me! He thought with all his expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the sake of people, Klein did not choose an easy chair, and casually found a hardwood chair to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leans against the back of the chair, his body is slightly bowed, his hands are naturally gripped, and the "flame" Daniz said:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak about the well-known pirates you know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a lot." Daniz responded with some difficulty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the same place and did not dare to move, as if he were a servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slowly slams his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the reward."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he pointed to the opposite chair:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz breathed a sigh of relief and sat down quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt that the other party was not bad, at least he was willing to give himself a seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Manau exited the port and sailed into the vast sea, sailing at noon at 13 knots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the "flame" Daniz got permission to stop, took the ticket, led Klein, found a first class s restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This restaurant is elegantly furnished, with violinists playing in the corners, and there are certain barriers between different tables to ensure the privacy of the dining environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps, Klein met the Donna family and Krivis and others, who occupied the big table and waited for the waiter to deliver the food. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Sparrow!" Because of the common secret, the little boy Denton has quietly changed his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna blinked and fully expressed her doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clearly remembers that Uncle Sparrow lives in the second class and should not appear in this restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein waved his hand and said hello, then pointed to Daniz:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "He treats guests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way..." Donna looked at Daniz curiously and thought that this gentleman was strange, especially Eyebrows, very unnatural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crives put down the knife and fork, silently for two seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your friend?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein chuckled and swayed to Daniz Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think that How to answer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz first gritted his teeth, then piled up with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
