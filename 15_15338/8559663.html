			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;诡法师... Klein Horan woke up from his dream and saw the rich night in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s still not dangerous until noon... He swears, he’s going to sleep again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he finally remembered that he had left the dangerous sea area, and he did not sleep after dark, nor was he completely disappeared and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call, or this kind of stable environment is good! I have to say that after dark, if you don’t sleep, you will be scared by mysterious disappearance. Children, let them not dare to sleep late, hey, I was often so scared when I was young.” Klein rolled over and sat down, went to the desk and poured himself a glass of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmed for a while, sipped his saliva, and gradually recovered his ability to think:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Zarato is really crazy...what did he have, or what went wrong...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" '诡师', sequence 4 is called '诡 诡 ' ', 'Divination' approach focuses on the words '诡术', '狡诈', '恶作剧', '奇奇'? Or directly summed up as 'surprise'? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, 'Clown', 'Magician', 'No Face' and 'Secret Master' really give me the feeling, 'Divination 'Looks like an exception, but in the eyes of others, the gods style is quite horrible at some point... So, Charato said that fate is not the main area of ​​this route?<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, it is clear that the extraordinary person in this path will be more biased towards the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to Will. Anthony, there are only three ways to get the 'Mage Master' potion formula. One is to find a secret meeting, go crazy. The Zarathu, the second is to go to the main peak of the Hornacs Mountains to find the treasures left by the Antigonus family, and the third is to obtain inside the church. For example, the Antignus family notes may have corresponding records. Formula.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These three ways are more dangerous than one. According to Russell's description, Charato was a long time ago as the 'miracle' of Sequence 2. The real angel, may later also promote the sequence 1, and the angels are flat or slightly worse, mad, he, no, although he lost his reason, but the greater probability is more difficult to deal with, at least without persuasion, The possibility of fraud, pure strength, I will ask Mr. Azick for their help, and will not be Chalatu's opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, unless Will Wealthing was born, but if He blends into this kind of thing, there is no small possibility that it may lead to the angel of destiny." 'The attention of Ulous.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The treasure of the main peak of the Hornaces, the reverberant proverb, the layout of the Antigonus family and the burial The rumors of the night country in the depths of history have made me feel that things are not so simple. I suspect that this may be a trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goddess church does not have to think about it. First, I don’t want to have an angel sitting in the church. There is a collection of 0-level seals. It is only Antignus. The Bakerland parish where the family notes are located also has a terrible demigod..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein couldn’t help but recall the original erased like a pencil Mr. A, and it’s probably a high-rise of the Goddess Church! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beautiful woman with a lack of spirituality... She smiled at me and didn’t know what it meant... Klein shook her head and felt that There is only one most practical way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to find a semi-god who is still normal in the secret meeting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is at least an exchange, even a slap in the face of the mad Chalat, just by Klein himself, but he can ask Azick Mr. Help, I can pay a certain price, please ask the "mysterious queen" Bernard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only consider this first... Klein quickly turned his mind to how to help Anderson Hood to release the curse of bad luck:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This has been more than two months passed, and the 'destiny member' Ricciard did not know if he had left Orawi. Hey, he never called my messenger and told me that it was The clues to the magical items required, however, this is not a big problem. Kano, who is a knocker, must have not left his post. He can be contacted by Mr. Ricciard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Oh, when it comes to magical objects or seals with powerful attack power, is Anderson's short sword not? According to the characteristics of the 'Reaper', the items he formed after he died are also... oh, I also It’s not a greedy devil, it will definitely pay an additional home fee.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein converges on the idea of ​​promoting jokes, pulling out the cover from the wallet The paper crane, removed, carefully wiped the pencil writing on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really broken, at most two more times..." He whispered aloud, then folded a thousand paper cranes, walked back to the bed, and continued to sleep. As for the use of the radio ticker to contact "Magic Mirror" Arrods, he intends to leave the pirate paradise in the east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dawn, Klein lazily gets up, slowly washes and feels this It is what life should look like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knock on the door interrupted his feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no dangerous premonition, the spiritual instinct tells Klein that the comer is Anderson Hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the strongest hunter, it’s really alive now... Klein snorted, controlled his expression and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson wears a deer hat that I don’t know where I got it, and I smiled and handed out a Lun gold coin:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yesterday's arrears."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took over the gold coins and took a handful of it:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your question has an answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson’s eyes are bright:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Is there any way to solve it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You won't tell me, the answer is that there is no way to solve it..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am such a person? I said that I have not saved, wait for death, goodbye! Klein whispered a few words, indifferently swept the other side: <br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a demigod who was good at transshipment and lived on the island of Olav. He owed me a request. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good! Anderson didn't hide his joy. "So, what price should I pay?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know very well... Klein deliberately silenced for two seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need Do you have a clue to a magical item with a powerful attack? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the value exceeds the transshipment ceremony, I will pay the difference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson Brow A little wrinkled, slowly unfolding, revealing a smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is such a magical item that meets your requirements, he has the extraordinary ability of a deadly attack, negative The effect is not strong, that is, can eat, can sleep, bad luck, easy to attract monsters and enemies, occasionally more love to talk, a little annoying, haha, make a joke.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frankly speaking, my 'death short tooth' is the magic item you need, but this is my only remaining weapon, um... the corresponding clue I have, it is a special one. A revolver, which emits bullets with weak, deadly, and 'killing' effects, and can be matched with bullets of different characteristics. The negative effect is that after each use, you will gain a weakness that does not exist, for example, Afraid of light, afraid of boat, afraid of dogs, etc., etc., and such weakness We will remain six hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you just put it on your body, there is almost no negative impact, which is to make you thirsty. This is a kind of endurance. If it is not this revolver The characteristics are duplicates of my abilities and the magical items I already have. I will definitely buy them at the time. The seller’s asking price is only 9,000 pounds!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
