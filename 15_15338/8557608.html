			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz was stunned and couldn’t speak, squatting aside, watching Galman Spalo lit the candle, burning the powder, dripping Pure dew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the smell of the diffuse, he couldn’t help but raise the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it wrong to use the wrong material?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers that it was not the "full moon oil", deep sleep flower, and chamomile used in the rebellion against the "Poseidon". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not asking the goddess of the night! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at him sideways and returned his sight to the altar:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No problem.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a professional who sacrificed and sacrificed, he knew that the role of burning pure dew, essential oils and herbal powders was mainly Two, one is to help the ritual host to better adjust the spirituality, enter the state, the second is to please the corresponding gods, to please the object of sacrifice, to improve the probability of the other party's response, in this respect, every god has its own, preference Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sacrifice, mainly depends on the abnormality of Cavitowan, has been completely crazy and it is eager for the smell of fog, both lack No, the other is not important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the above two conditions are met, taking no pleasing will not affect the holding of the ceremony, neither increasing the success rate nor increasing the possibility of failure. It can be treated with perfuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Cavi Tuva is sensible, even if I strictly follow the requirements of the ceremony, do you think it will respond to me? Klein whispered a word and stepped back half a step, ready to start the most critical part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment, without a side, said directly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be farther away." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I? Daniz is not angry and nostalgic, nodding his head quickly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ran to the door of the warehouse and planned to run away as soon as he was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein half closed his eyes, meditating on the numerous balls of light that overlapped one another and quickly entered the state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He whispered in Elvish:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The leader of the sea and the spirit world, The protector of the Rothde Islands, the dominator of the sea creatures, the master of the tsunami and storm, the great Cavitowan.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your faithful servant prays for you Gaze;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for your dedication;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for you to open the door to the kingdom . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the words that are screaming out one after another, the wind in the wall of spirituality gradually rises and becomes fierce, seeming to be overturned together.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s clothes are flying, taking out another metal vial that has already been prepared, and dumping the remaining thousands of hunters’ blood into the air for about 5 ml.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very spiritual material!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blows away the drip of blood, whistling into The candle that symbolizes "Poseidon" Cavitowa.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the candlelight expands into an illusory door, surface It’s all symbolic and magical, and the sound of the sea is faintly faint.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, everything moves out, only a gasp is across the illusory door. Resounding, like behind it is a huge monster that is hard to suppress your own hunger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge gasping sound became more and more obvious, and it became clearer and clearer. Daniz, who heard the door of the warehouse, had some scalp tingling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusory door is suddenly open, and the hurricane that almost sees the shape rushes out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sharp screams, Daniz felt the invisible spiritual wall broken and found himself flying directly, like a boat in a storm I slammed into the door and slammed the muffled sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell outside the warehouse, and there were many wounds with wooden thorns on his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red fireball in his instinctive instinct is faint in the storm and quickly extinguishes, like a candle burning near the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he flies in the air, there is a huge mouth that looks like a bloody big pot after seeing the open illusory door, it reveals more than human arm Still long, slightly curved milky white fangs, madly hit the illusory door, want to enter the real world directly, the beast-like howling sounds first echoed inside the warehouse, shaking the nose of Daniz bleed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein flew up in the hurricane just now, and his gaze was immediately occupied by a bloody, forked, huge core of Ziz lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body is black, stiff in the air, penetrated by the snake core, turned into the ashes after the burning of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's figure appeared on the other side, the hat fell, the clothes were messy, quite wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, he knows that there will be a situation, knowing that there will be danger, always being on high alert, not relaxing his vigilance, and using the paper man as a substitute in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Cavituva, after the illusory door without shaking, finally found that the crazy impact was invalid and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a sigh of relief, letting the blue water come from all directions, collapsed deep into its throat into a whirlpool of horror suction, and swallowed a The whirlpool of the freighter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron cigarette case on the altar flew up and dropped into the whirlpool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small kettle that contained the ash of the herbs flew up and dropped into the whirlpool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of debris in the warehouse flew up with the dirt and cast the vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein also flew up, and it was hard to resist the vortex! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to hit the ring, ignited the flame, and jumped beyond the influence of the vortex, but the hurricane accompanied by the suction destroyed the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His figure was thin and became a paper man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the paper man throwing into the whirlpool, Klein, who emerged in another position, emptied again, unable to get rid of the horrible suction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crucial moment, he no longer hesitated, and the "black gloves" worn by the left palm became pale and stained with some dark green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He enabled "squirming hunger" to directly drive the soul of "Steel" Maviti! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s body became heavy and then pushed out the left palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An ice wall that was not too thick was solidified in front of him, helping him to temporarily isolate the whirlpool of "Poseidon". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking this opportunity, Klein fell, and he stepped on the ground and fell into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice wall was only torn into pieces by the sucking force of a pound for a second and flew into the throat of a giant sea snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein relied on the power of the living corpse, his feet were strong, fixed his body, did not fly again, but still unstoppable to the illusory door. Sliding into the bloody mouth of Cavitewa, two deep gullies were dragged on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is getting closer and closer to the illusory door, and the nose is filled with the stench of blood and decay. The front is stained with smudged milky white fangs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought sharply and quickly got a solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method is very simple, is to throw out the "black eyes" from the "secret master" Rosago! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since you are making a seawater whirlpool and want to swallow everything, then I will let you take another bottle of "magic medicine" without auxiliary materials. And with the "real creator" spirit pollution! In this way, I don't believe that you can support it if you are about to collapse! Klein clenched his teeth and reached into his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it was instinctively aware of his dangerous map, or perhaps the insatiable Cavitewa’s lack of patience, at this moment, it slammed up and down, Let the seawater vortex in the throat collapse and collapse, turning into countless drops of water, and spraying it outside the door of the illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a heavy rain in the warehouse, and Cavitova’s throat was condensed with a silvery, dazzling, countless electric entangled thunderball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, it spit out the thunderball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "storm", the silver-white thunderball turned into a striking lightning bolt, which quickly expanded outward, destroying the simple altar and occupying the entire warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zizz, Zizz, in the thunder and lightning, Klein’s figure is constantly emerging, and it is constantly blackened and turned into confetti, Deniz outside the warehouse. Also affected, the hair was all upright and the body twitched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously used several "paper man substitutes", and Klein, who was approaching the limit, finally waited for the electric light to subside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the illusory door was completely destroyed by the ritual, and quickly and unstoppably closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poseidon" Cavitowa's unwillingness is isolated outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the moment, the illusory door disappeared completely, surrounded by a mess, and there was only one candle left on the altar, swaying the fire weakly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! Daniz leaned forward to the warehouse wall and barely stood at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to talk, but can’t stop twitching, only to express his grievances with his eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;German Sparo is really a madman! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banxi Port, the feeling of horror that I experienced, I can still think back now, and I will have a nightmare... I chose the things that the rebels produced before. It also provoked the curse of "Poseidon". On the way, I was scared that I almost fled... This time, I made another sacrifice, and I almost summoned Cavitowa. It was really dangerous to the extreme... he Why is he so passionate about adventure and love to make big things? Looking for stimuli on the verge of death again and again! Is this his crazy performance, or is it the reason? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cavitowa is still very strong, even if it is already on the verge of death, even if it is separated by the "gate of sacrifice", only a part of the power can be revealed. It was almost easy to solve me... It is a half-god that can counter the "King of the Seas"... Kline pulled out his feet from the ground and saw that the boots were broken. At the same time, he found that whether in luck or inevitable, in any sense, Cavitowan accepted his "sacrifice" because When the giant sea snake made a whirlpool, it swallowed the iron cigarette case and many other things that were stained with fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, I can try to locate its hiding place in the spiritual world, but I have to wait for it to die, no longer interfere with and fight against my divination... ...this kind of search must enter the spiritual world, can not always use the fog... Klein just quietly vomited, I felt the left palm of the glove filled with indescribable madness and hunger, it seems that we can no longer wait for food, it is necessary Devouring the wearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no sinful guys nearby... Kline looked sideways at Daniz at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
