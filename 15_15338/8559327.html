			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the reminder of Will Anthony, Kline’s first feeling is to be thankful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I didn't die, didn't continue to explore..." He sighed without any disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he also saw the murals related to the "swallower" Uluos, met Anderson, this did not know what happened so that the difference became terrible The monster guy, but at least not in the real danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if the next time I enter the dream, it will appear randomly in a range, or from the end of this time... If it is the latter, the most correct way is Don't disturb Anderson any more, lest it be irritating to him, returning directly from the original road, leaving the black monastery... Kline withdraws his gaze and reads the remaining tips: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Except for dreams, others are relatively less troublesome, as long as you don't try to get close to the ruins and ruins, don't look directly at the things that fly through the sky at noon, don't challenge the storms with signs, and then follow the safe passages that others have verified. , then the problem is not big.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the mermaid, you always sail forward, you will always meet, because at their level, you can only live in a safer The area, and this is not much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Finally, I wish you all the best, you are really in a critical stage of development, and then you may sleep a lot of friends Will Anthony."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last long sentence is a bit sloppy, but Klein knows the meaning of "the snake of destiny":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I was born, it was not particularly important and especially important. Don't bother me! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I work hard... Klein is not so sure in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he can be promoted this time, it may not be long before he asks the other person where to go to find the "Divination" sequence 4 potion formula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more confidence in finding a mermaid, Klein immediately left the dream, put on his hat, and went to the pirate restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the delay of the dream, many dishes have cooled down, but the pirates are very happy to eat, because there is no dead,<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there are no dead people, they have a lot of bragging capital to see the wonderful events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want a glass of milk?" Frank Lee took the plate and sat across from Klein and asked enthusiastically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the dialogue in the dream, Klein’s face shook his head calmly and firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very worried that the milk on board is the experimental product of Frank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank did not care to drink the milk:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember dreams and Have you said the little things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Klein cut the keel fish fillet in the sauce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fish is known for its less thorns, and often only one main thorn. In Beckland, it is divided into medium and high-grade ingredients due to different varieties, but on the east side of Olawe Island, it is often caught on the edge of a safe waterway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank laughs and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My statements at the time were somewhat inaccurate, their real role It is for the creatures to be able to produce milk without breastfeeding. Whether it is female or male, as long as it can be used to produce milk, stop and return to normal, so that poor cows do not have to suffer those tortures, so that men and women It’s fairer to raise children, and it’s more conducive to women’s going out to work...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, what are you talking about... Klein almost didn’t Maintain the person of the German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he is synonymous with true madness not by Gelman Sparrow, but by Frank Lee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the Seven Churches, the Church of the Storm and the Church of God of War are most male, the Church of the Sun is second, and the painting of the Church of Knowledge and Wisdom is different from other churches. It is classified as IQ, steam is neutral, and even because of industrial development. More labor has been used in conjunction with the Goddess Church to encourage women to go out to work...” Klein’s mind flashed the difference between the seven churches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at Frank Lee, as the other side said was just a trivial little thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Frank quite happy and couldn’t help but drink more milk. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pirates have finished their lunch in shifts, "Stars above" Jia Delia pushes the window of the captain's room again, magnifying the sound with magic:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is an island in the front 1.5 nautical miles, where we docked and waited for the storm to pass.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this ocean In every minute and every night, there is a possibility of a horrible storm. I am not sure when it will come, but I think it is safer to wait until it has passed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She explained a lot more than before, because this is not an emergency, there is plenty of time.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most feared things for people at sea is the storm, naturally no objection, according to the command of Jia Delia, under the command of the chief of the sea, Ottolov and the sailor, Nina, nervously preparing for the call Matters.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows Klein to confirm one of the reminders of Will Anthony's reminder<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Do not challenge the storm with signs!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, an island covered with huge trees appeared on the side of the "Future" side.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailboat over 100 meters is adjusted to travel past and docked on the leeward side.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half an hour passed, The sky is suddenly dim, and the clouds of lead color appear one after another.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They overlap each other and seem to have completely enveloped the surrounding waters.<br /><br / >&nb Sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the huge roar, the glare of lightning blew, a hurricane rolled up in the distance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is connected to the cloud, down Even the sea is more exaggerated than any of the legendary giants, like a giant snake hovering to destroy the world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horrible tornado brings the same mountain The waves of the branches. The lightning of the branches did not stop because of the rainstorm. They continually hit the surface of the sea and split the tiny electric snakes to spread around.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦The raindrops hit the deck of the future, so that the pirates who had entered the cabin or sheltered from the rain had a feeling of the end of the day.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm did not After a long time, about a quarter of an hour later, the waves subsided, the hurricane dissipated, and the midday sun ruled the sky.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can go to the island to do something, but not Going deeper must be within the range of the artillery. "Jade Liya gave the pirates a short chance to relax.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein remembers the "Silver Snake" Will Unsetin’s reminder, no Exploring the island's desires, after leaving the "Future", he only walks back and forth on the beach and enjoys a down-to-earth feeling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beach, sun, trees...very The taste of the holiday... Klein thought with a funny smile, the corner of his eye suddenly swept to a high-speed moving black spot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is flying from the edge of the cliff !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black spot is getting bigger and bigger, it turns out to be a figure!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Klein Not far from the "star above the sand" Jia Delia also noticed the anomaly, half turned the body, removed the heavy glasses on the bridge of the nose.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that The figure is getting closer and closer, wearing a white shirt, black vest and black trousers. It is a young man with medium size and blonde hair.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlucky Anderson! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein recognized each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visitor turned out to be the terrible Anderson in the dream world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who said that the companion was exploring, and never came back, but he was a member of the team that explored Anderson! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Anderson raised his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without hesitation, Klein, who is a German Sparrow, swears a spell and reads a Guhames word:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Storm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell made of white tin immediately became a thorny hand, like growing out A small piece of blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the spiritual perfusion, the mid-air winds swell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein throws the spell in his hand to Anderson with no expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp, thin blades that condensed into blue were shot at the target, just like coming in line to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson is raising his right hand with a smile, as if he wants to say something, but a low mysterious mantra and a scalp numb The wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked condensed and fell directly to the side, turning and rolling, and the wolf was like a red iron plate in front<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blade was inserted into the beach and cut a clear gap, but it was still a little worse and failed to hit the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! Stop!" Anderson swayed and evaded while screaming, "I am not hostile! I am not malicious!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anderson Hood..." "The star above" suddenly spit out a name and raised his hand to stop the German Sparrow who had pulled out a spell. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows this Anderson? Klein did not recklessly read the opening spell, and said in a deep voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has changed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I met him in a dream. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not surprised by the unlucky Anderson, because since the pirates are in the same area in their dreams, they are very close to each other, and they are separated from them. Not far from Anderson must be in the vicinity of the "Future".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! No! Anderson stood up and smiled and raised his hands. "I know you, you asked me a lot of questions. At that time, I wanted to make a joke. Really, make a joke, be active, you don't feel the environment." Is it a great experience to become terrible? Of course, I mean to let each other, not myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I am going to explore, how can I still live?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is It’s my concern... Klein didn’t believe the other’s explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson shrugged his shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I say it, I am ready to explain, I am ready to tell you, I am joking, and I am going to ask you for help. I hope that you can come here with me. As a result, the dream was over at that moment...Bastard, this is really unlucky!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfamiliar with the unfortunate qualities... Klein sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intended to take out the coin in person and use the divination method to test each other, and suddenly heard the "Star above" Jia De Li Yadao:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to him to talk about what happened.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
