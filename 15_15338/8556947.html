			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, Red Dragonfly ran!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sailor rushed into the captain's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Running?" Elland raised his own telescope and looked puzzled at the calm sea. He just saw the "Red Dragonfly" disappearing. horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brows wrinkled and he did not understand why there was such a development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his view, the armed forces of the "White Onyx" must not be able to directly scare off the Red Dragonfly Pirates, and the two sides will inevitably circulate dozens of Circles, come and volley many times, in order to appear that the other side feels that this hard bone can not be shackled, do not dare to entangle for a long time, so the reason for the rational retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the "Red Dragonfly" just passing by, without the idea of ​​looting? However, if they do not plunder, what do they do in this channel? This is the easiest place to be blocked by naval fleets and church ships. Even when the four kings and seven generals pass through the nearby waters, they will try to keep a low profile... Elland is full of doubts and feels that things are not so simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cautiousness keeps people from disaster, can't care... Elland puts up the yellow-brown monocular glasses and takes a few steps back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand halfway and sailed long distances:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight, stop at Banxi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Report the pirates to the Navy and the Church." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the normal plan, the next stop of the "White Onyx" will be the port of Tiyana, and it will probably take three days to sail at 13 knots. Arrival, from Port of Tyiana, will go directly to the final destination of the capital of the Rothde Islands, the generous city of Byam.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from Pritzport to Yam has a faster way of sailing, which is to stay only once in the middle, in Banxi Port, 120 nautical miles from Port Damer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red Dragon really left? "Donna's father, Uldi Blanche, walked to the window and looked into the distance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crivis quietly nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice just fell, and the sailor’s cry came from outside:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ! Dangerous release! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the official confirmation, Donna and Denton’s brothers finally relaxed and had the courage to come to the window and look outside.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the Red Dragonfly Pirates very powerful? Donna widened her eyes and looked for boats that were already far away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was very powerful. Krivis gave his answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How powerful? "Denton immediately asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the bodyguard Tigri took care of his hair, hehe laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if it is not the ship's artillery and hundreds of pirates, only Captain Johansson and Chief Archer Anderson, it is very powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andelson nickname 'one-eyed', the reward in the kingdom is 500 pounds, the owners of our room add together, and then get a few sailors Help, maybe you can beat him in the encounter, and Johansson, nicknamed 'Sea Wolf', can easily solve such opponents. If they board the ship, 'Sea Wolf' will no one can resist, and his reward is enough. It’s 900 pounds, close to 1,000 pounds!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A lot of this?” Donna was shocked by the “sea wolf” and “one-eyed” and was surprised. Their bounty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her impression, her father’s income for one year is £1,500! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, the four kings and seven generals are famous for the five seas?" Donna asked innocently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crivis responded earnestly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, the Red Dragonfly Pirates are well known throughout the Sunia Sea?" Donna Logic clearly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Teague nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But why are they running?" Donna squinted her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not necessarily running..." Cecil himself is not too aware of why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crivis once again looks out the window, the forehead is slightly "Chuan" type:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There may be other reasons, maybe they don’t want to rob this time, just simply meet.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other reasons? There was a guess in Donna’s cranky thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it that Uncle Sparrow’s gentle messenger that is as high as the house scares them away? Uh huh! It is really scary! Donna’s heart is like boiled water, and the bubbles are rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was excited to turn her head and looked down and found that her brother Denton’s eyes were also bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men clenched their mouths indiscriminately, and immediately understood that the other person was just like what they thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We went out to blow the wind, it was on this floor." Donna found a reason, took her brother and left the 305 room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside, Denton pressed the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are going to find Sparo Uncle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The answer is correct!" Donna smiled slyly. "I saw him before 312."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;312 in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer mentioning the "flame" of the "Iceberger" Daniz re-visited the "Red Dragonfly" that was transferred to the bow, and laughed: Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They must have been scared by the declaration of the cannon of the naval giant ship and the news that the pirate group was destroyed before, and they ventured into this channel to plunder and wanted to earn earlier. Enough money, leave the sea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, what about a huge ship cannon?" The Navy and the Church have a lot of powerful things, they have always existed, and they have not caused the situation of pirates. We can't run away, we can always run away, right? They can't always escort those merchant ships? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that the ironclad ship is getting bigger and bigger, the steam turbine installed will be more and more powerful, and the speed will one day break through 18 knots, 20 knots. Being bitten by them, they can only wait to be caught up, but the sea is so vast, thousands of tens of thousands of ships are thrown down and filled with no corners. There are still many, many things that humans have not explored. What have they done? Those places are hiding, although dangerous, but there are also opportunities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is really a type of words...you don’t think a crazy adventurer is fundamental Don't care about these things? Klein regained his gaze and swept the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze finally fell on his leather suitcase and then raised his chin there:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wrinkle the dirty clothes inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deniz’s expression is solidified, and I can’t wait for a fire to ship the whole boat. Burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels his anger is like a steam that spurts out, and it erects a gate called reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz opened his mouth, took a breath, opened his mouth again, and took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it all?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only dirty, the coat can be brushed." Klein was almost laughed at by the strong anger of the other, thinking it was The treatment that Danis should receive after robbing the innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The inside of the suitcase is the clothes he changed for last night. Because he was a little lazy, he only licked his underwear for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm, can't get out of control, calm, can't get out of control... Daniz continually warned himself and walked to the suitcase next to Gilman Sparo , open it and take out the clothes that need cleaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just started to get busy in the bathroom and heard the doorbell being squeaky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein opened the door and found that it was Donna and Denton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Sparrow, didn't bother you?" Donna's eyes turned left and right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Klein let the road go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two little guys entered the room and saw Daniz in the laundry unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about servants?" Danton asked subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Klein responded to Daniz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna said a little confused: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first class has an exclusive wash woman Commissioner, the fee is calculated in barrels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice has not fallen, Daniz has already frozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he was too angry, he forgot about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz licked the drops of water on his hands, turned his body, and smiled, and said to Gilman Sparo:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I ask the maid to help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein doesn't have to look at the other person's malpractice, Smiled and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only recognize the result."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, Daniz is obviously loose A tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two questions and answers made Tangna aware that something was wrong. The little girl was suspicious: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Uncle Sparo, are you not friends? He, how he grew up differently!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein found a chair to sit down, Unmasked, plainly said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Accurately, he is my prisoner of war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Prisoners of War?" Denton left to look left and right, do not remember the conflict between the two uncles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donna was first confused, then moved, and asked cheerfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is, he Is it a pirate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Klein nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Red Dragonfly Pirates is also Uncle Sparo, are you scared away?" Donna asked excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at Daniz, replied with no expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doubts were all answered and Donna was exceptionally satisfied. She glanced at Daniz and unconsciously lowered her voice:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Sparrow, does he have a name? No, does he have a reward order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
