			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the exhibition hall where Russell’s diary was placed, the members of the two “Mechanical Hearts” squad suddenly heard a sigh of silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They looked sideways and looked at the seals on the glass showcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a gray dot in the scaled down museum model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was an inanimate item in the nearest washroom." One of the team members made a clear judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other player relaxed a little, frowned, and said in a guessing tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The dead leaves that the wind blows in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is possible." The first member of the team opened his head and said, "Wait for passing." The security personnel will check it out and confirm the situation. The captain let us stay here, no matter what happens, don't leave, especially if you can leave alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you encounter In the most urgent situation, they can evacuate with the Russell Diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." His companions had no objection to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the office area on the second floor of the museum, Klein is like floating Wandering the soul, passing through one wall after another, flew directly above the restored study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he did not fly too fast, always sensing the fire downstairs and calculating the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the straight line length between the two points is close to 30 meters, he lifts the unreal transparent right hand and makes a silent voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the washroom on the first floor, the box of matches burst open and made a small bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the red flames ignited, lit up the paper towel, lit the pot, and lit the isolation door of the wooden structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This raging fire has not spread, but the momentum is amazing enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the security guards who heard the sound immediately rushed to the location, and in the exhibition hall that monitored the entire situation on the first floor, the two "mechanical hearts" The team members also saw the flames in the "model", and the subconscious was going to rush there. This was both an attempt to extinguish the fire and a preparation to arrest the mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, they just ran two steps and stopped, remembering the captain’s command:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what happens, don't leave this showroom and leave the Russell Diary! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They looked at each other and watched the two entrances to the exhibition hall, quietly taking out their own extraordinary weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——As the extraordinary of the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery, they never lack equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the lantern is being patrolled in different exhibition halls on the first floor. S. Levimore also noticed the movement, and thought of rushing in the direction of the exhibition hall where Russell's diary was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priority for securing items is higher than catching the sneak! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Max believes that no matter what purpose the other party has, as long as it enters the first floor of the house affected by the seal, it will not be so Easy to leave! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a lack of help outside, the intruder will even be trapped here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even if there is a helper, it takes a short time to break the effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Once you come in, you are the prey of the trap!" Max Levimore ran fast, passed through the exhibition hall, and finally saw the two companions. Figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not in a hurry to follow up, but first looked down at the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the slate is relatively thick, Klein could not obscure whether there is a gas field and emotional color below, only open his arms and fall forward, silent The interest came to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His illusory and transparent figure is quickly blurred and blended into the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceiling on the first floor with huge crystal chandeliers suddenly highlights A face that is almost invisible and faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strange face overlooks the exhibition hall, and the eyes keep turning, and the scenes in all corners of the area are stored in the line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No extraordinary, no security staff... Klein muttered, the whole figure piercing the ceiling, half-flying half-speed down to the glass Russell desk in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at him and did not hesitate to extend both hands at the same time, grabbing the bookmarks in the "Creative Manuscript" and the graffiti like a child. Bookmark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is preventing scenes where powerful and extraordinary people can trace back here with wonderful means, so it’s important to show that you don’t know which bookmark is abnormal. So that the investigator can't doubt the "Justice" lady who has only touched a bookmark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirits that received the Aziz copper whistle blessed through the glass cover, holding the two bookmarks steadily, and then wrapping them in The body of the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing this, Klein was so determined that there was no longer any obvious embarrassment and tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out again and grabbed another bookmark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow! Wow! Wow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loud and screaming baby shouts suddenly echoed in the exhibition hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is such an illusion, as it comes from far and far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s body is stiff, like the lake’s ultra-low temperature, and there is a clear freeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is in a state of spirit and seems to be frozen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow! Wow! Wow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bursts of baby crying, there are black crevices that surround the Klein, like a discontinuous iron fence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, one of the black slits cracked open, inside is a bloodshot eyeball, the center of the eye is a deep pupil, there is a hair The white bugs are constantly crawling and crawling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, two, three... Those black slits are opened one after another, one after another, the eyeballs are highlighted in the air, they are dense and indifferent Watching Klein mercilessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they emerged, everything around them solidified, and even the illusory spirit could not penetrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is even hard to sense the existence of the spiritual world, it is difficult to see the transparent figure of different shapes in infinity, it is difficult to see different colors, there is a lot of knowledge Clear and bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you only taking bookmarks?" A soft but unfeeling female voice was introduced into Klein's ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is standing in the same place, only seeing the front is a two-story, tall bookcase that is fast against the ceiling, where there are stairs and passages around a book Book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, the topmost step sits on the road covered by darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure's feet in black leather boots hang down, leaning against the wooden stairs, hanging in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you only take bookmarks? Where do you know to get bookmarks?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure asked again, the softness was a bit harsher, around the ones The bloodshot eyeball is expanding rapidly and seems to occupy the entire space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice did not fall, Klein painted a face like oil, suddenly revealed a big smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His illusory, almost transparent figure disappears instantly, I don’t know where to go! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the Azick copper whistle and two bookmarks wrapped in his spirit are gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, in the magnificent old palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s figure is on the top of the mottled long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned back on the back of the chair and chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His spiritual state is not its extraordinary power, it does not come from the transformation of the flesh and the spirit, this is to call yourself, Respond to the product of your own ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of this ritual stems from the mysterious space above the fog, stemming from its speciality! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as long as Klein succeeds, there is no need to try to escape. If you end the call, you can return to the fog and then from here, Instantly return to the flesh in the real world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the space above the fog can block the power of gods such as "eternal yang" and "real creator", Klein believes that there is no disturbance of the gods. In this case, the suspension of the summons will not be interrupted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the other party does not kill his spirit or directly stun him, Klein will be sure to escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why he didn’t want to become a spiritual body and “traveled”, the interval was too long and the variables were too many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light and dark blush of the window shines inside, sitting on the bookshelf The woman at the top of a ladder looked at the desk in silence, looking at Klein's original location, the crying of the baby around and the one eyeball disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the top of the ladder suddenly became empty, like no one has ever been there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the exhibition hall for the Russell Diary, Max Levimore said to the two players:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You are here, I am looking for the guy who sneaked in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He must have been trapped somewhere on the first floor ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he looked at the seal and looked at the "model" on the first floor of the museum, trying to find the red that belonged to the sneak Point and quickly lock the opponent's position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he looked at it and counted it, but he didn’t think it was right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number has not increased at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Max Levimore stiffened in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; King's Road 18, a wealthy businessman's storage room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s eyes regained their brilliance, and the corners of their mouths were slightly raised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the bookmarks and Aziz copper whistle on the fog, saving time and returning to the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
