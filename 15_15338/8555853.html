			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time Klein has seen a familiar person dying in front of him, but it is the most sudden and no warning. His mind still seems to remain. Tallim Dumont just asked about the expression of a person who really likes the taste of a person. It is a kind of vivid expression that has the potential to be excited and to show off, but it cannot be directly shared due to certain factors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too fast... Normal illness won't cause death so quickly! Klein's expression was so condensed as water, and his teeth were opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He landed on one knee and squatted down, seeing the gas field and emotional color of Tallim Dumont disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart position that is tightly held is entangled with black air, like a snake, and gradually dims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An extraordinary means like a curse? Klein made a preliminary judgment in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the waiter wearing the red vest and the nearby black-and-white skirt maid ran to the horror, watching the eyes on the ground with round eyes and the remnants of the remaining corners of the dead. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed his eyes and screamed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the nearby police station Tell them that someone is dead here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Mr. Moriarty." The red vest waiter immediately turned and ran outside the door, panicking with a coat I forgot to wear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gaze of the gaze, Klein did not check Talim’s belongings, nor tried to pull off a few hairs, so that no one would try to divination. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His identity is already semi-official and semi-underground, and it is entirely possible to use the power of "mechanical heart" to conduct follow-up investigations. There is no need to be a lonely hero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of the scene of playing with Tallim Dumont many times, think of the commissioner and investor introduced by the other party, think of the one that has been remembered for a long time. The emotional story of the answer, Klein could not help but long, slowly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the murderer of Talim?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tali has offended An extraordinary person who is good at cursing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking at today's performance, he should be in a state of very happy and stable, completely unaware of the horror of the horrible characters..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One question flashed in Klein’s mind, but he lacked the inspirational soil because he didn’t know much about Tallim Dumont. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the police arrived, he was an eyewitness and accepted the inquiry, delaying a lot of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until all this is done, Klein has the opportunity to leave the Hillston area and head to the "Lucky" bar in the Beckland Bridge area. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson is still drinking there, but the pure distilled malt-making distilled spirits are replaced by golden-colored frothy beer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein raised his right hand and pinched his mouth half a squat, slamming the past and tapping the deskway:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Your job is to drink here every day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson was shocked and saw Sherlock Moriati Relax:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This response is very familiar Ah... Klein silently sighed and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a case involving extraordinary people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Carlson immediately looked around and found that there were many guests in the "Lucky" bar at this time. They either shouted loudly at the wine glasses or eager to go to the boxing ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein followed closely and expertly closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your amount of wine seems to be very good." He said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I just drink slowly." Carlson dropped the glass and picked up the club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he inexplicably added one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I recently wanted to be alone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't care about this issue... Klein licked his lips:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I In the Craig Club in Hillston, I met a death. It was my friend, a descendant of aristocrats, an equestrian teacher. He is usually very healthy. He has recently had a very good mental state, but he just died in front of me. It looks like a sudden heart attack, but my vision tells me that he may have been cursed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are good at spiritual?" Sen subconsciously asked a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What specific circumstances did Mr. Stanton have created for me? After becoming the informant of "Mechanical Heart", they did not ask which way I was the extraordinary person, and did not inquire about my origins and origins... Of course, let the informants keep certain secrets of their own. It is also a strategy often used by official organizations... Kline responded frankly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the deceased's chest has some faint illusion." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It may indeed involve a curse, involving extraordinary people." Carlson did not ask again, slowly nodded, "Hilston District... This is in us' The heart of the machine's jurisdiction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the northwestern part of Beckland, the core area of ​​this metropolis, Queens, Jowood area “Defeated Persons”, the West District and the North District belong to the “Night of the Night”, and the Hillston District and the Beckland Bridge Area are managed by the “Mechanical Heart”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Carlson looked to Klein and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Which god does a friend believe in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking for a few seconds, Klein replied with a bit hesitation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The Lord of the Storm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The believer of 'The Lord of the Storm'...only one of his dead?" Carlson asked with a frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Klein gave a positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlsenmo licked the top of the club and spit out his breath:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have no power Take over, this is the field of 'deceiver'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I will pass on the information you submitted to them. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kingdom of Lun, the principle of jurisdiction for extraordinary events is that they are first divided by faith, and if there are more than one believer in multiple churches, then the jurisdiction Klein is no stranger to this, and is not interested in Carlsen. Sincerely said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Thank you, I hope they can find the real murderer as soon as possible"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson puts the wine glass next to it and sighs:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a descendant of aristocrats, and the penalty will definitely be valued. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop for a second, he looked at Klein, said low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very difficult I believe you have come to Beckland for more than three months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to have established a wide network of contacts here, with numerous resources."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he returned to Minsk Street, the sky was completely darkened and the gas lamps were lit up by the staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the relationship with Tallim Dumont is not deep, he is also an acquaintance that Klein meets almost every week, every other day. Five friends who will get together to play cards, and Talim is very enthusiastic, has been touting the detectives of Moriarty, and has personally introduced the commission and investment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His death also made Klein feel sad and full of helplessness to fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, he still has a lot of anger, the anger of cursing the murderer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope I can figure out what is going on, I hope that the 'deceased' will not be enough because the Duke of Nigan was assassinated..." Klein sighed Go down the carriage and go to your own door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, he found that there was no light in the Samuel home next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that they are on their way to Desi Bay... Is this the Bakerland's New Year atmosphere? And I have no feeling at all..." Klein was a moment Some flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such emotions, he slept early and woke up in the bell at seven o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to change his mood, Klein decided to try homemade cakes today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you have used breakfast, go buy materials." He whispered, drank milk, and flipped through the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he saw an "obscenity" in the Tasok newspaper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Aizi Talim Dumont died on December 18 due to a sudden heart attack. His funeral will be held at the Crown Cemetery at 9 am on December 21, and he is hereby obeyed."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——In the Northern Continent, an ancient tradition has been formed because of the corpse and other reasons, that is, it will be buried as soon as possible after death. Of course, the premise is that there is no shortage of money in this respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudden heart disease? Is this the final result of the investigation? Or is it that "the punisher" deliberately numbs? Klein frowned and couldn't judge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you can go to the fog to see if it is a trap for "the punisher", but the probability of failure is high, after all, there is no carry-on, Not for myself... He took a breath, calmed down, and filled his stomach in an orderly manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsequent attempt was not beyond Klein’s expectations. He had to leave Minsk Street and travel to the Hillston area to visit Essinger Stanton. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big detective walked in a warm room, pointing to the front:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock Is there a breakfast? My chef's craftsmanship is no worse than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I have used breakfast." Klein shook his head and declined. kindness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger stopped and asked at random:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you going? New Year? I am going to go back, no, go to Rumburg."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not yet finalized, maybe the sea." Klein perfunctored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The scenery there was originally very good, but the coal and iron resources are abundant, and the shipping is also quite developed." Essinger took down the neckline and touched the pocket. Pipe, "Do you seem to be anxious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Stanton, I have something to ask you." Klein took advantage of Tallim Dumont's The death, the result of your own vision, the way to provide advice to the "heart of the machine" and the obituary of this morning are completely described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he concealed what he has become a "mechanical heart" informant, only to find out in the case of "desire apostles" for friends. Official extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
