The scene in which the brown car moves forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the passengers who are ready to take the public carriage have all been finished, and the door is tightly closed and gradually away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the carriage, twenty or thirty humans are too close together, the gas fields overlap each other, hiding each other, in the eyes of Klein, simply colorful, glorious Colorful, it is difficult to distinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head silently, raising his hand and tapping his eyebrows, closing the "Lingshi". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, just a simple feeling that can help if you meet it, but if you have already missed it, the situation is not particularly clear, then I can’t always remember to hang up and delay my own affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bathing in the blushing moonlight, along the still lively Narcissus Street, Klein strolled back home and saw Melissa sitting at the table, A bright gas lamp, immersed in the practice of school layout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bites the pen pen, slightly frowning, thinking hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Banson?" Klein asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." Melissa looked up and took a few seconds. "He said that he turned several districts today and was so tired that he was sweating." Take a shower and relax."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein laughed and suddenly found that Melissa was wearing a strip she had never seen before. Long skirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is beige in color, has stylish lambskin sleeves, and has a tulle ruffle on the neckline and the edges of the placket. The cumbersome design is a light and everyday type, which perfectly sets off the youthful feeling of the 16-year-old girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New dress?" Klein asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the consumption that he and Benson strongly demanded before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa "Hmm": "br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" just got from Mrs. Rochelle Come back, I think, and so on, I have to wash it. It’s better to try it first.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened quite doubtfully:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Rochelle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this not a previous neighbor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa nodded and explained: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Rochelle is actually Tailor, just not lucky, had to help people to mend clothes at home, live, um, a little hard, I know that she is good at craftsmanship, the price is cheaper than going to the women's clothing store, and it is also fit, just in her place. Ordered a new dress, only need 9 Sule 5 pence, only a few days, the same style of skirt, in the Harrods department store, to be a full pound and a half!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Good festivals and family...Sister, I know, at least half of your reason is to sympathize with Mrs. Rochelle... Klein did not blame Melissa’s self-assertion, but instead smiled:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When did you go to Harrods department store?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in the Howls block, in divination Near the club, it is a place where at least the middle class can afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Melissa spoke for a while, for a long time, "It’s Selena, and Elizabeth, let me accompany them, in fact, Well, I actually prefer gears, prefer steam and machinery, um."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Girls occasionally visit department stores, um, very good Klein smiled and appeased her sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as he had to go back to his bedroom to change the laundry, he suddenly heard the movement inside the washing room near the small balcony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in a few seconds, Benson brushed his hair back and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How? Is there any praise for Melissa's new dress?" He glanced at Klein and smiled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to have forgotten, just asked where to do it..." Klein thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson suddenly shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am really incompetent brother, Melissa just When I got the long skirt, I was reluctant to let go of it. I finally got the dishes, washed the bowls, and I couldn’t wait to put them on. I haven’t taken them off yet.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"...I don't want to wait for the shower and change it? By the way, the wash is dry..." Klein subconsciously refuted the explanation given by Melissa,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"啧," Banson exclaimed. "These days have been hot. She has been busy in the kitchen for so long. I think it would be much more comfortable to write homework after taking a bath."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also to... Klein was amazed and smiled at his brother Benson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that you are such a Melissa... What is wrong with girls love beauty, there is no need to make excuses to modify it... his mouth is upturned, gently rocking Head, went into his bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After bathing, Klein vaguely heard a knock on the door downstairs, and his heart suddenly made a mistake:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Does the staff taking coins from the gas meter not come once in two weeks? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it Mrs. Short next door? No, the lady is said to strictly abide by the middle class's communicative etiquette and will not visit at an inappropriate time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In doubt, Klein wiped his body clean, put on old but comfortable shirts and trousers, and ran down the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and found no strangers, so he asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Did someone knock on the door?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson, who is looking at the newspaper leisurely, laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s Beechmont, one of the police officers in charge of Iron Cross Street. I asked if we had a face-faced 18-year-old boy today. Oh, he gave us a portrait recognition, but unfortunately, I haven't seen Melissa and I have won the bounty, you, Klein?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Klein probably understands What is going on? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher" Tries successfully escaped from the Dock Dragon Bar in the Docklands and fled to Iron Cross Street and Narcissus Street, so he got the police. ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and getting this step also shows that the action of arresting the "teacher" is close to failure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t think about it anymore, because he hasn’t started fighting training yet, shooting can only say that he’s just getting started, this time to consider dealing with the natural The Assassin is simply joking about taking life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, he slept very unsteadily, always worried that the "teacher" would sneak into his own house to create another bloody case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Daffodil Street is safe all night, and the morning sun dispels all the haze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean, relaxed, put on his formal attire, put on a top hat, and carried a cane, all the way to Zouteland Street, and Roshan, in the reception hall, made a sound call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Klein." Roshan responded cheerfully, pressing down the voice. "I heard that the big action failed last night?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catch the 'teacher' of Tries' action?" Klein curiously asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At this time, they need an extraordinary person with tracking ability, like me." Klein made a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was no lack of followers at the time." Suddenly, Dunn Smith’s snoring sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roshan slammed his head and saw the captain wearing a black trench coat, leaning against the partition frame, staring at himself with a faint gray eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was busy raising her hands, covering her mouth, and then shaking her head again and again, indicating that she had said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den moves his gaze and turns to Klein, contemplating a moment: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The heart of the machine, and our night-timers, a total of more than six extraordinary people, tracking the injured Tris came to the Iron Cross Street and found his temporary residence, however, the clues are broken here, whether it is Extraordinary means, or normal investigation, have lost their effect. He disappeared completely like a sudden evaporation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do I need to use divination to help? Klein asked, tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denn shook his head slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The heart of the machine has a 'sneak peek', is a A veteran who is not much worse than the old Neil, I even suspect that he is already in the position of the sequence 8, just do not know what the corresponding potion is called."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The spirit will be passed down to the present, and there must be something special about them." Klein comforted the captain with a mouthful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole morning, as before, he continued the occult course, continued reading of historical materials and literature, and continued to practice certain skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that lunch time is coming, Klein is gradually eating away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, he simply picked up the information and listened to the call of his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Dunn Smith came to the office of the civilian staff, his voice was low and mellow and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein, you and I went to the Chanis Gate, the seal '2-049' has been escorted, and the subsequent actions may require your induction of the note."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...OK." Klein got up and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s inner thoughts began to look like, thinking about what the seal was like, and wondering if this action would be dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a tight silence, he followed Dunn down the stairs and entered the ramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After going straight through the intersection, Dunn suddenly stopped and turned his head and said seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You follow me to do this action, keep it, never stop, remember, never stop, it's about your safety!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while speaking Dunn flexed his arms and stretched out. He stretched out and re-squeezed. He kept repeating this cycle without interruption. <br /><br />############ What is the speciality of the seal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Dunn nodded solemnly. "This action allows us to find out that you have a problem in the first place." And there will be no danger of life in time to rescue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Klein did not hesitate, followed by "bending arm stretching." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this arm is tired, change another one." Dunn groaned again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "2-049" seal is really strange... What can this action mean? Very dangerous look... Klein's thoughts flashed, watching the captain carefully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
