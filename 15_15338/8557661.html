			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Layers of illusory praying into the ear, Klein seems to have a flesh now, a deep pain in his head, can not wait to hit the wall, to hurt pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture of the prayer from different people makes him uncontrollable, extremely horrible dizziness, seems to be walking on the edge of the abyss, at any time Fall down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, he has the "Black Emperor" card and the Azick copper whistle to strengthen the spirit, and usually used to the feeling of being prayed, for other things. The semi-divine sequencer is now out of control, the pain falls, the monster becomes a monster or collapses into flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the extraordinary features here have been combined with the snake's teeth to form a seal, and the degree of danger and negative effects far exceed the "2" level... Ryan did not blindly step forward, but after a few steps back, he left the area where the voice was concentrated, alleviating the pain and dizziness that allowed the body to disintegrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood next to the muddy body of Cavitewa, staring at the white scepter inserted in the half-pillar and thinking about how to bring it go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he has naturally given the seal a name in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Poseidon Scepter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, from the feelings and reactions I just felt, I barely be able to get close to it, unplug it, but only support a few Second, I can't carry and use it... But it doesn't matter. Once I get it, I will end the call and return to the fog, which can effectively block the thousands of prayers and the negative effects that I have temporarily unknown. Let me You can study with confidence... Klein quickly got an idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the need to flip a coin, his instinct in the state of resentment can communicate with the spiritual world and get inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spiritual instinct tells him that this is not dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the decision, Klein began to clean up the mess, and by the way look at what can be found in the remains of the ancient elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first went to the corner, picked up a translucent "biotoxin bottle", screwed the lid, stuffed it into the body, and then found it when he turned back. Under the muddy body of Vitua, there is an iron cigarette case that is half hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...I thought it was swallowed by Cavi Tuva and it has been corroded into a residue... Klein is amazed and walks quickly . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the current that was previously dissipated by the sea water was a bit numb, his right hand was arrogant, letting the iron cigarette box float slowly and fell into him. Palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the eyes swept, Klein saw that the surface of the iron cigarette case was covered with corroded traces, but it was barely able to use it. Other items that go are not left in the slightest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was the smell of fog that made Cavitowa uncomfortable, spit it out on the spot, or the iron cigarette case had a certain change and was corroded. Not so fast, to the death of Cavitewa?" Klein doubts, at the same time, has put the cigarette box into the body, ready to leave and then do research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a scenario, you must race against time, and there must be no delay, because Klein does not know when the storm church and the kingdom military will find it here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bypassed the half-pillar from a distance and entered the rear of the almost collapsed hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be a lot of murals here, but with the destruction of the wall, it has broken and disappeared, and Klein flies all the way to the end, only to see a delicate and gorgeous The throne was buried by stones and pillars, revealing almost one-third. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the left side of the throne, there are half of the remaining murals, the content is the confrontation between the two figures:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking down on the enemy is a man who is stepping on the waves, wearing dark clouds and draped in a storm. He has a softer, contoured line of Klein's previous oriental charm, with a spear in his hand that is made up of electro-optical light. The background is The ocean that drowns everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white robe is very classical and has a round of halo behind it, quietly emitting a radiance, such as the same sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his feet, there is an imaginary circle divided into twelve squares, each with symbols that symbolize different times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a shadow behind him that seems to be behind the curtain. There seems to be an eye in the shadow that is silently peeking out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quickly explained this with his solid mystery and rich insights from all sides:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;waves, storms, dark clouds, lightning... This should be the ancient god "The Elf King" Sunia Solem... Sure enough, like the legend, the elf's facial features are quite soft... This ancient "storm" The Lord "has no violent feeling, looks unexpectedly good, huh, huh, this is the mural in the ruins of the elves, beautifying their own gods is very normal...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sun-like halo Twelve squares symbolizing time, this... Isn't this the father of Amon and Adam, who was passed down as the ancient sun god in the outside world, and is known as the "creator" of the omnipotent god in Silver City? There is a shadow behind him, and there is an eye hidden behind the curtain... Yes, the "real creator" has an image that is "the eyes behind the shadows"! (Note 1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, is this the "creator" who has recovered the authority of the ancient gods and has eight "kings of angels" to follow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mural depicts the "Elf King" Sunia Solem against the "creator"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein retracted his sight and looked for something else worthwhile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following spiritual intuition, he came to the throne and put his hand into the bottom of the collapsed stone and pillar, and pulled out an item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a squashed gold wine glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is engraved with complex and delicate patterns on its surface, the high feet are already bent, and there is a line of elf at the bottom:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Heavenly Disaster, Gao Shinam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original owner of this ruin is a superior elf named Gao Shinham? He, or He, is the title "natural disaster"? Um...It is consistent with the book of Natural Disasters that Latsia found. Both of them should belong to the upper elves of Gao Shinham. There is a wonderful connection between them... Unfortunately, this gold wine glass is just a simple wine glass. Just because I engraved the real name of the upper elf, with a little spirituality... If Gao Shinham has not fallen, even if it is just a real name, it can make the glass have unusual ability, but unfortunately... Klein preliminarily judges Gao Shinam It is already dead, because "Poseidon" Kavitova is his successor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Klein could not be sure about this, because after a few hundred thousand years, the book "The Book of Natural Disasters" still has the sequence of Latsia. The extraordinary person who is not low is crazy and out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this is not something that 'Poseidon' Cavitowa can do... Is it that the upper elf, Hirschm, has the secret to distinguishing its extraordinary characteristics? Is it just a part of Kavitu's inheritance? The other part is the source of the traits of the Book of Natural Disasters?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hoshinham died without being stiff ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, Cavituva when swallowing the extraordinary characteristics of High Hannam is just a beast with no IQ, and no one knows what happened at the time. Perhaps, some of the characteristics were lost, and they became a seal. After the defeat of Caviteva, they fell into the hands of the storm church...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, next week Tarot will ask the little 'sun' through the 'world'. He should know who Gaosham is. In fact, he doesn't have to ask. He has dedicated two pages of ancient mythology today. Maybe there will be a superior elf next time. Their detailed description..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it and stuffed the glass into the body. After all, this is gold, and even the upper elf Gao Shinam is not dead, there is a certain connection with the wine glass, and there are fogs that can be shielded and isolated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check it again, see no other gains, grams Ryan quickly flew back and picked up the black hardwood cane, dealing slightly with the traces left by the previous battle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
