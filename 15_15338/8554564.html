			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only worship the moon, do not respect the goddess? Klein couldn't help but reveal his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had heard that this kind of thing was to understand the school of life, but I did not expect that a witch who was sick and dead in the South China would even hold a similar View. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- After the "Pale Age" of the end of the Quaternary, the violent sea became a veritable one, the North and South continents were isolated, no longer there, and the life school formed In the early part of the Fifth Age, it was obviously impossible to develop into the South Continent before Russell sent people to find a safe waterway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women Karaman also belonged to the early, active era from the invasion of the northern continent for more than a thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the two extraordinary "powers" that belong to the North and South continents and cannot communicate and communicate, at about the same time, choose to worship the moon itself, ignoring the night goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This coincidence makes people have to think about why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a new god born, separated from the power of the moon? However, as a god, He should not be so obscured... or, although the goddess took away the authority of the moon, the believers of the original Luna have survived, from the Quaternary, and even the Tertiary, have been passed down. And after the separation between the North and the South, two flowers, a witch king, a life school? Klein is roughly speculating, but suffers from no corresponding clues to narrow the scope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He temporarily gave up thinking, hurry up and quickly browsed the content behind the book of Secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the preface, W. Kalamman said very directly that many of the rituals, secret deeds, astrology, and summoning of the book are derived from the original moon worship. And detailed description of the corresponding name:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The unique red moon, the symbol of life and beauty, the mother of all spiritual power."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a name! But there is a lack of a more popular description similar to the "night goddess" and "the earth goddess"... If there is such a hidden god, his followers will inevitably develop a simple name that is more suitable for oral praise. Instead of the original moon worship... Klein perceives an eccentric place and relies on his own occult knowledge to do the analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, with the 'Red Lord' to hold the ceremony, it will obviously point to the goddess, but with a very similar but more detailed and detailed name, then Can bypass the goddess, point to their source of strength, point to the so-called primitive moon... don't know what is strangely present..." Klein was curious and thought with some horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is not much time, the specific content of the follow-up is just a quick tour. I found that many of the many rituals are as elaborate as the Waka’s Karaman himself. Pointing at the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Klein, this does not need to care too much, he will not copy those things, provoke the original moon that does not know what it is, he wants to learn It is the overall structure, design ideas and details of the secrets and rituals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only by grasping the laws of possession, can he make his own, a close to the "king of yellow and black", ritual, astrology and summoning . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe after a long time, I will have a self-contained mystery... Klein took off the wrist of the wrist and finally confirmed the book of Secrets. The true and false of 》. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting a positive answer, he is not in a hurry to take advantage of the extraordinary character of the werewolf, and he will not sell it anyway. The same reason, he intends to slow down Slowly study the origin of biotoxin bottles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly returned to the real world, opened the curtains, and the sun was unable to illuminate the earth. It was hiding behind the clouds and the smog, which was a bit pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Auntie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Klein reached over his mouth and sniffed sneeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he found that he had some headaches, not enough spirit, and seemed to have a cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it for a moment and quickly understood the reason:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negative effect of the biotoxin bottle is to make the holder weaker and develop to get sick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you carry it a little longer, you may even die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not something that can be eliminated by spiritual shackles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, after Klein’s war, the spirit was almost dry, and the body poisoning was quite weak, carrying a biotoxin bottle to hide in the “leverage church”. For half an hour...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the time spent returning to Minsk Street, he was shamefully sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately not serious... does not affect anything..." Klein snorted again and packed up to take a hot bath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wash is finished, he specially fry an egg in order to treat himself, and the frying is full of aroma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Witch King's "Book of Secrets", a magical toxin biotoxin bottle that is no worse than the sun brooch, and a sequence of 7' werewolves 'The extraordinary characteristics of the legacy, this time earned a lot... It’s regrettable that I didn’t get the extraordinary character of the 'live corpse'...” Klein sat down at the table and counted the harvest while eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that makes him feel bad is that he has used 11 extraordinary bullets, each of which is worth nearly 10 pounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, I burned 100 pounds...I’m worthy of money.... No wonder most of the low- and medium-ranking people are so thirsty for money. ... Klein looked down at his breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They add up to a few pennies! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast, Klein took a leisurely look at the newspaper, sneezing from time to time, wiping his nose with paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church bell at 8 o'clock just subsided, and his doorbell was already ringing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not accidentally see the reporter of the Daily Observer, Mike Joseph. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reporter with beautiful blue eyes and two mustaches but a rather rough skin took off his hat and greeted him, then went straight to the theme:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Detective Moriarty, do you have free access to my commission?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a little cold, this paragraph Time is normal and the commission is relatively unsuspecting... Klein, who just finished the vote, smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was slightly sick, but this did not affect I fight and shoot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike suddenly smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your help. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will leave now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amount, Moriarty Detective, Have you used breakfast yet? I ask you, as an employer, I am responsible for your food today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please take my breakfast? Klein snorted: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just finished eating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I recommend You go to the Eastern District for breakfast, so you can see a lot of things, and then give me a cup of coffee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...no problem." Mike Pointing out, "The carriage I hired is waiting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at him up and down:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., you better wear it a little worse, otherwise my work will be very busy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike looked down at his own system The coat, with a clear understanding, said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case in the Eastern District." Klein pointed out inside. "I have some specially prepared clothes. Well, we are almost the same size."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike forbearance Can't help but sigh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really professional."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional crime? Klein groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After changing the attire and becoming an ordinary worker, the two got on the carriage and headed to the edge of the Eastern District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Auntie!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took out the paper and wiped his nose and nose and licked his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no trash can nearby, he folded the paper and put it back in the pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The food in this café is OK, of course, this is relative to the residents of the Eastern District." Kline pointed to the slightly greasy coffee at the corner of the street. Museum Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he occasionally stayed in a nearby one-room room, he came here for breakfast several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that it is already a good restaurant here." Mike doesn't think it's a coffee shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, it’s more than nine o'clock, there are very few guests in the cafes – residents in the Eastern District often run out of breakfast, start work or find a job at seven o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Mike ordered potato goulash, bread, coffee and other food, Klein looked around and looked for a window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he saw an acquaintance, the middle-aged man who had pretended to be a journalist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earliest he brought me here... How did he use breakfast now... Klein thoughts, turn to Mike:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have interviewed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he was carrying the coffee cup to the "wanderer." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is still wearing the thick jacket before, a little white hair looks more greasy, the beard is quite obvious, but there is no last time there is a drowsiness between the eyebrows The face is no longer so scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, we met again." Klein sat across, greeted and found that the other's breakfast was a black bread with a penny. Cup of cheap tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man raised his head and took a closer look, opening the door with surprise:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Reporter, are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein laughed twice and pointed to the side of Mike Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my colleague, he wants to do a more in-depth investigation of my previous interview."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike is experienced and knowledgeable The reporter did not say much, only smiled and drew, and said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Moriatti’s detective posing as a journalist, he did not know it today, but the other party borrowed a fake journalist card from him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that you are really a reporter!" The middle-aged man suddenly snorted. "But this does not prevent you from being a kind and kind person." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How have you been recently?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man drank the tea channel:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With your help, I finally fell asleep. At first glance, eating a stomach is no longer so weak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
