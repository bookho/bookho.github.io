			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short time, Audrey quickly understood what the "sun" was saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He said that "The Fool" sent his angels to purify Amon's avatar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Footer" sent an angel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. "The Fool" has an angel as a waiter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every angel has at least the strength of sequence 2...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is taken for granted, I have long anticipated things, but it is still exciting because it has finally been confirmed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only the gods can drive the angels! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey was excited to see the streamer, could not help but think of what the "fool" angel's angel looks like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when I was lucky... I looked at the top of the bronze table and was full of worship and eagerness. At the same time, her inspiration told her that the always gloomy "world" was also sitting up straight because of shock, which made her inexplicably proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Fols recalls the previous encounter, she obviously only asked Mr. "fool" to help interfere with divination, but he saw one The twelve-winged archangel descended and covered his own body with wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really is an angel...black wings, twelve pairs of wings of the archangel...and this is really the normal operation of Mr. "fool", send angels at will. Helping the party members to lift the crisis... Folth suddenly did not dare to look up at the gentleman sitting at the top of the bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she still only has sequence 9, although she has not received a complete occult education, she has been mixed in different extraordinary circles for three years, some things even if not deliberate Inquire, it will also be introduced to her ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This contains a very important one:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not look directly at God."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past Folsic did not have a deep impression on this sentence, but at this moment she suddenly felt that this is the truth, summed up from the lessons of countless blood and tears. The truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel? There is an angel around Mr. Fool! The "downside down man" was frightened and inexplicably so excited that his body shivered slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before telling the name, responding to the prayers and rituals, indirectly indicates that the "fool" is equivalent to the gods, but this is still a bit of intuitive evidence. Now, the angel has appeared! His existence is enough to illustrate a lot of things! Among them, the most important thing is that angels represent the most direct deterrent! Mr. "The Fool" has no influence on the real world... Even if he does not pass the blasphemy, He can let his majesty radiate a certain area... Alger instantly thinks a lot, both for the shallow sweat and the feeling before. The future is full of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he pondered the details of the "Sun" discourse:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Folk" Instead of letting the angels come directly, the gentleman first taught the "Sun" a ritual. Through that ritual, He sent angels to purify Amon's avatar, which circled a large circle...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this indicate that Mr. Fool’s influence on the real world must break through many obstacles? This is consistent with my previous judgment that He is in a state of being sealed by the seal... But perhaps it is something special about the land of God's abandonment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Fool" did not have such a performance before, because he was a little bit off? He is gradually getting out of trouble...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sitting in the "fool" position, looking around in a circle, clearly aware of the respect and enthusiasm of Miss Justice. I was aware of the panic and excitement of Mr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik is not very able to understand the reaction of "downside" and "just". In his opinion, is it a normal thing for a god, a great being, and an angel to serve? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Amon's avatar was purified, I coughed There is a bug, exactly the same as in the previous dungeon. Do you know what it is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of "The Fool" Klein, "The Sun "Successfully, there was a translucent bug with twelve transparent rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey and "Magic" Firth curious about the past, and shook his head, indicating that he had never seen or heard Said a similar bug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve Rings... In the Book of Secrets, similar symbols are related to time... The Amon family is descended from the ancient sun god In the old age, people believed that the sun was related to time... This kind of reluctance is an explanation, which can be confirmed from two aspects... However, why the current "eternal glory" is just the eternal light. Order incarnation, the god of contract, the guardian of business, but there is no longer a field involving time... Kline is not in a hurry to answer the image of maintaining the "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiles and his eyes are mild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted Man" Alger thought for a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be Amon The carrier of the avatar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In myths and legends, there is a kind of bug similar to its shape, with twelve transparent rings called 'Times Worm', however, no one has ever seen 'bugs of time', many people suspect that this is actually the name of a sequence of potions. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The worm of time..." is very close to my guess... although this is only a myth that is circulating in the middle and above of some churches. The story, but the information itself is also of great value. The "inverted man" is told this way, so that everyone can hear it because he has already received remuneration. Has he learned a lot of important situations from the little "sun"? Klein heard a burst of emotions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The worm of time...Amon made the carrier of the avatar..." "The Sun" Dairik whispered to himself. It seems to have solved a lot of doubts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He curiously asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be used doing what? I mean it is dead. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. Under the gaze of "Sun" belief and respect, Alger suddenly groaned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, sitting at the top of the bronze long table "Foolish" is a gentle opening: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main material of some rituals. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Klein speculated according to the contents of the Book of Secrets.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he I am not worried that I will make a mistake, because it is almost impossible to falsify.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no ritual that needs the "bugs of time", only that you have not seen enough Klein leisurely added a sentence, in my heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some ceremonies... "Justice" Audrey and others instantly imagined.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, great Mr. Fool. "The Sun" Dairik half got up and took a gift, then introduced the topic to the existence of the relationship between Silver City. "Exploring the squad back, I mean the exploration of the 'Shepherd' led by Elder Lloydya." The squad, they completed the exploration of the "Demolition Creator" semi-destroyed temple, returned to the Silver City, and I found that several members of the team I know, the personality has changed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They were polluted by the 'real creator'. "After hanging people" Alger did not hesitate to point out in a firm tone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real Creator"? "Justice" Audrey couldn't help but watch The bronze long table is the first one.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Really?” Dairik did not want to believe and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "downside down" tone is not wavering: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You describe their details in detail Change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that person is still that person, but it is very different from before, optimism becomes low, and only smiles are polite Sexual smile..." "The Sun" Dairik said all the anomalies he found, including the "Shepherd", the fact that Rodriguez’s elders suddenly turned better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Inverted Man” Alger said at his discretion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The situation may be more than you think It’s still serious, and pollution is the best possibility.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If they have sincerely believed in the truth, the amount, the 'fallen creator', then Trouble, can't save again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In any case, their character, thoughts and opinions will be distorted and become a hidden madman. You can start from this aspect and let the six people discuss The group 'other members found it wrong.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have already reported, but the 'chief' does not seem to believe me too much." Dairik slightly feels grievances Open the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Folth could not help but sigh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is because Your 'chief' suspects that you are possessed by Amon and is trying to figure out something that is not good for Silver City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do? Even if I tell They 'fallen the creator' exist, they will not believe me?" "Sun" Dairik anxiously asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted Man" has been indulging for two seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actually, your one' The chief 'should also start to pay attention to the 'Shepherd' and the members of the exploration team. Your silver city can continue to the present. The most basic vigilance of the top is still there. It will not let go of every possible threat. The only one. The problem is that their attention is certainly not enough, even if it is not as good as your concern for Amon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before waiting for the "sun" opening, he also said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe you can take advantage of this and wash away your suspicions...you find an opportunity for some of the exploratory team members to show the most complete anomaly, And he clashes with him, so that other members of the 'six-member council' can find out the wrong level and increase their attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And at the same time, you hand over something that is suspected of 'the worm of time', saying that in the middle of the conflict, you suddenly become embarrassed, do not know that What happened, only vaguely heard someone shouting 'Real Creator', waiting for the waking up, already coughed out the bug.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Involving the evil spirits, many ways and The ability is not to use, your 'chief' will logically guess that Amon’s avatar has conflicted with the spiritual pollution left by the 'real creator' and eventually disappears into a dead worm. Your monitoring will definitely Therefore, it is much lower. If you are safe for a while, the suspicion will be completely gone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the "supplemented man" very skilled in this respect... "Justice" Audrey mouth is thinking slightly.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik heard his eyes bright, only to feel that "downside down" Mr. really trustworthy, came up with such a good way!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "How do I let the team that explored the team show the most thorough and abnormal state?" He quickly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger was silent, after a few seconds to open:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately added another sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is a 'real creator' related item Just fine..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
