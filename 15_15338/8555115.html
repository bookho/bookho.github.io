			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short time, Audrey quickly understood what the "sun" was saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He said that "The Fool" sent his angels to purify Amon's avatar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Footer" sent an angel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. "The Fool" has an angel as a waiter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every angel has at least the strength of sequence 2...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is taken for granted, I have long anticipated things, but it is still exciting because it has finally been confirmed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only the gods can drive the angels! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey was excited to see the streamer, could not help but think of what the "fool" angel's angel looks like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when I was lucky... I looked at the top of the bronze table and was full of worship and eagerness. At the same time, her inspiration told her that the always gloomy "world" was also sitting up straight because of shock, which made her inexplicably proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Fols recalls the previous encounter, she obviously only asked Mr. "fool" to help interfere with divination, but he saw one The twelve-winged archangel descended and covered his own body with wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really is an angel...black wings, twelve pairs of wings of the archangel...and this is really the normal operation of Mr. "fool", send angels at will. Helping the party members to lift the crisis... Folth suddenly did not dare to look up at the gentleman sitting at the top of the bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she still only has sequence 9, although she has not received a complete occult education, she has been mixed in different extraordinary circles for three years, some things even if not deliberate Inquire, it will also be introduced to her ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This contains a very important one:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not look directly at God."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past Folsic did not have a deep impression on this sentence, but at this moment she suddenly felt that this is the truth, summed up from the lessons of countless blood and tears. The truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel? There is an angel around Mr. Fool! The "downside down man" was frightened and inexplicably so excited that his body shivered slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before telling the name, responding to the prayers and rituals, indirectly indicates that the "fool" is equivalent to the gods, but this is still a bit of intuitive evidence. Now, the angel has appeared! His existence is enough to illustrate a lot of things! Among them, the most important thing is that angels represent the most direct deterrent! Mr. "The Fool" has no influence on the real world... Even if he does not pass the blasphemy, He can let his majesty radiate a certain area... Alger instantly thinks a lot, both for the shallow sweat and the feeling before. The future is full of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he pondered the details of the "Sun" discourse:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Folk" Instead of letting the angels come directly, the gentleman first taught the "Sun" a ritual. Through that ritual, He sent angels to purify Amon's avatar, which circled a large circle...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this indicate that Mr. Fool’s influence on the real world must break through many obstacles? This is consistent with my previous judgment that He is in a state of being sealed by the seal... But perhaps it is something special about the land of God's abandonment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Fool" did not have such a performance before, because he was a little bit off? He is gradually getting out of trouble...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sitting in the "fool" position, looking around in a circle, clearly aware of the respect and enthusiasm of Miss Justice. I was aware of the panic and excitement of Mr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Didn’t you treat me as a god before? Why do you still hear this when you hear angels? It seems that the proof on the side is always inferior to the deterrent that is directly displayed. If there are new members who question me in the future, I will be prepared in advance to let the "world" jump out of the big slogan, and then I will give him a hand. Get rid of, kill chickens and monkeys... wait until things calm down, and then re-pinch a "world"... Klein's thoughts gradually diverged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik is not very able to understand the reaction of "downside" and "just". In his opinion, is it a normal thing for a god, a great being, and an angel to serve? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Amon's avatar was purified, I coughed There is a bug, exactly the same as in the previous dungeon. Do you know what it is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of "The Fool" Klein, "The Sun "Successfully, there was a translucent bug with twelve transparent rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey and "Magic" Firth curious about the past, and shook his head, indicating that he had never seen or heard Said a similar bug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve Rings... In the Book of Secrets, similar symbols are related to time... The Amon family is descended from the ancient sun god In the old age, people believed that the sun was related to time... This kind of reluctance is an explanation, which can be confirmed from two aspects... However, why the current "eternal glory" is just the eternal light. Order incarnation, the god of contract, the guardian of business, but there is no longer a field involving time... Kline is not in a hurry to answer the image of maintaining the "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiles and his eyes are mild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted Man" Alger thought for a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be Amon The carrier of the avatar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In myths and legends, there is a kind of bug similar to its shape, with twelve transparent rings called 'Times Worm', however, no one has ever seen 'bugs of time', many people suspect that this is actually the name of a sequence of potions. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The worm of time..." is very close to my guess... although this is only a myth that is circulating in the middle and above of some churches. The story, but the information itself is also of great value. The "inverted man" is told this way, so that everyone can hear it because he has already received remuneration. Has he learned a lot of important situations from the little "sun"? Klein heard a burst of emotions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The worm of time...Amon made the carrier of the avatar..." "The Sun" Dairik whispered to himself. It seems to have solved a lot of doubts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He curiously asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be used doing what? I mean it is dead. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. Under the gaze of "Sun" belief and respect, Alger suddenly groaned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, sitting at the top of the bronze long table "Foolish" is a gentle opening: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main material of some rituals. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Klein speculated according to the contents of the Book of Secrets.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he I am not worried that I will make a mistake, because it is almost impossible to falsify.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no ritual that needs the "bugs of time", only that you have not seen enough Klein leisurely added a sentence, in my heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some ceremonies... "Justice" Audrey and others instantly imagined.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, great Mr. Fool. "The Sun" Dairik half got up and took a gift, then introduced the topic to the existence of the relationship between Silver City. "Exploring the squad back, I mean the exploration of the 'Shepherd' led by Elder Lloydya." The squad, they completed the exploration of the "Demolition Creator" semi-destroyed temple, returned to the Silver City, and I found that several members of the team I know, the personality has changed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They were polluted by the 'real creator'. "After hanging people" Alger did not hesitate to point out in a firm tone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real Creator"? "Justice" Audrey couldn't help but watch The bronze long table is the first one.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembers very clearly that the "real creator" was once destroyed by the "fool"'s leader, and he also Guess the leader of his own Tarot Club to be a "evil god nemesis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
