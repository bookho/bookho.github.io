			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Florand said that the Sauron family has a history of more than two thousand years, and is even longer than the artisan church. They have witnessed all the cooperation and disputes of the Quaternary. , light and darkness, and have survived until now, except for the Augustus family of Lun, the Einhorn family of Fossac, the Castilla family of Fenetport, and the rest of them. Powerful families, such as the Antignus family and the Zarathu family, have either become dust of history or become mice in the sewers, hiding in hiding, and seeing no light."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said, let me be his men, to be the gift of the ancient and glorious Sauron family, is a gift to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I wanted to fuck his ancestors for eight generations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the Sauron family has more than two thousand years of history, and it’s surprising. Also known as the 'God of the Gods', whether it is the current orthodox seven gods, or the god of death, the original witch, the dark side of the universe, the real The owners are still active in the real world. It is said that they often display miracles. The Sauron family can survive to this day and occupy a high position. It is definitely not an easy task."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The long history has given them more than just arrogance. They must have hidden secrets, and perhaps extremely horrific seals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really a huge thing that stands on the ground and people can't look straight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing here, Klein had a lot of thoughts: Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell can finally overthrow the rule of the Sauron family, and the incumbent and protector must have experienced a terrible and terrifying thrill, the Sauron family does not have "0" "The level of seals, "1" level is certainly not lacking, plus the high sequence strength that may exist, even if the steam and mechanical god church fully supports Russell, it may not have good results... Is it true? Before this, the Sauron family has been declining and weak, and this is the turmoil of the Intis. The external manifestation of the state? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did they experience during that time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seal is missing? The high sequence is dead? So it attracted the attention of a ambitious family? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm... From this diary, Lun’s Augustus family will not feel strange to Antigonus and Charato, they are inside There should be a corresponding record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Sun" mentioned that Baiyincheng persisted for more than 2,500 years in the "dark dark age". According to my preliminary judgment, this is exactly The number of years since the disaster occurred, the Sauron family claimed to have a history of more than two thousand years nearly two hundred years ago. I don’t know if it can continue until the Cataclysm... I’m looking for an opportunity to deliberately mention the Sauron family and see the “sun”. The reaction, if the "sun" is still a slap in the face, it indirectly indicates that the Sauran family has risen since the Cataclysm. Perhaps they have benefited greatly from the Cataclysm to become a Quaternary aristocrat, the fifth century. The royal family...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, even if the "sun" does not know, it cannot be fully proved, perhaps his history is not well learned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned to the third page and found that the content recorded above should be written in Russell's early days as the governor of the Republic of Intis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen from several diaries on this page that Russell has enacted and promulgated a new Civil Code to encourage invention, protect trade, and hatch industry. The revolution is not just to satisfy the ambition of playing Napoleon's evil taste and changing the world. In this way, he reconciles with the eternal pilgrimage church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternal Vigor is also the god of contract, the guardian of business, the more perfect and closer to the era of the Civil Code and the more prosperous trade is in line with his church demand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From this part of the diary, the relationship between Russell and the Church of the Eternal Sun is gradually frozen and begins to improve. He became emperor after more than a decade. Caesar, who should have been endorsed by the two churches at the same time, would be too risky. So, what exactly was he assassinated?” Klein stunnedly turned his attention to the fourth page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On August 11th, Florent was stunned and showing off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He said that he is the most promising person in the generation of the Sauron family, because he is very similar to his great-great-grandfather."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, in the extraordinary field, is talent important? Amount, good at comprehending the essence of play is a very core talent, but it is not necessary, as long as you know how to play the law, not stupid to comprehend the wrong meaning, do not do things that are easy to get out of control There is hope that the potion will be completely digested, that is, it will take more time. It is not impossible to become a high sequencer in the lifetime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To the high sequence The main obstacles are the difficulty of obtaining extraordinary materials and the troubles of the corresponding ceremonies. Of course, it must be admitted that the innate extraordinary people have more time to prepare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Florent's great-grandfather was a high-ranking strong? Like him means talent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that this diary is written At the time, Russell was still very young, and did not understand the two laws of extraordinary character and conservation. Klein was invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his current knowledge, I can probably understand the meaning hidden in Florent Sauron’s words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The extraordinary features left by the high-sequence strong have their own spiritual branding, which is one of the reasons why the potion compounded by this material is easy to get out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And much like the original owner, you can evade this negative effect to the greatest extent, the probability of promotion is much higher than the average person, so it is called talent "Religious" confession should also belong to a similar situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has the same effect as playing the law, but it is impossible to popularize... After the promotion is successful, it must also be played according to the name of the potion, and the characteristics will be thoroughly digested... ... Klein thoughtfully aimed at the two diaries behind this page and found that Russell was very fond of the open customs of Intis, but he was worried that the future wife would be equally open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a slight squeak, Klein placed the fifth page at the top:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "On April 20, I once again attended the secret meeting of the ancient organization. The one member still shocked me. It is hard to believe that they are all people of this organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time, I know some of the ideas of this ancient organization. They think that people always lose themselves a little until they fall asleep, so they must work hard to observe themselves and remember themselves. Relying on this and all kinds of knowledge to obtain purification, in order to deal with the final end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They keep and inherit thousands of secrets for tens of thousands of years, think that dusk is inevitable When the coming, the end is unavoidable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They believe in the original Creator, that He did not really die, until dusk, until the end of everything, He Wake up from the sleep, let everything belong to itself, and open a new world, new calendar "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the actions of this organization are based on the above ideas. It can be seen that they are hostile to the 'real creator' and use each one without hesitation. Words that describe degeneration and evil describe Him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They hold the second slate, mastering the twenty-two ways of God, but stipulate Members can only choose a few of them, except when they are already extraordinary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the secrets of these routes?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will record it first and then go back and analyze it later. These ways are: 'Singer', 'Sailor', 'Reader' and 'Viewer'."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, I have to change the customary term for the sequence, which is LOW inside the old organization."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I analyzed from the hostile relationship, Mr. A’s request, “singer”, “sailor”, “reader” and “secret Approach can be very close in sequence 4 swap ah ...... "manipulator" is a high sequence "audience" pathway? Why do many secret organizations claim that the end will come, such as the witch sect, such as this ancient organization, and they themselves do not rely on this mission, is the need for brainwashing, or is there really a so-called dusk? Klein associates a lot, but because of insufficient information, he can't get a positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he couldn’t help but whisper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
