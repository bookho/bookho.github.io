			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this thing for me? Klein was shocked and the whole person suddenly became sober. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a person who has repeatedly experienced similar things, he has been a bit "persecution paranoia" in this regard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really have this possibility... I just arrived at Olavy Island, and the 'Desire Mother Tree' used the dreamland to give Follett Ken a revelation and start Throughout the plan, when I met Bilt Brando for the first time, the celestial sects held a ceremony to let the tramp die for a gluttony...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If it is for Admiral Amyrius, the plan must ensure that the substitute is lost, he can't find another helper, or there is no other way to hide it. Obviously, this is uncertain, my blending is proof. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the goal is me, the above questions can be explained." Klein used the "clown" ability to control facial expressions and watch silently. Follett Ken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a guess, he has more doubts in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But how do they know that Bilt. Brando will look for me?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German Sparo can become anyone's intelligence is 'the disease will be' What was passed by Trey, which is beyond the control of the 'desire mother tree'...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, this can also be viewed from another angle, precisely because of this The news spread, and I arrived at the island of Olav, and the 'desire mother tree' came down to revel and promote this thing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem is that He Why pollute me? The hatred of the Rose School and I have not reached the level of attention of a sacred god, and Miss Sharon, they killed a sequence of 5 'souls, a sequence of 6 'live corpses', a sequence of 7' The Werewolf's took away the 'Crimson Moon' and the 'Biotoxin Bottle'... The hunting for the 'Blood' has not really started yet, it has been interrupted, has not been put into practice, just killed 'Steel' Mewitt is only...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Retaliation due to these events may not even exceed the rank of the Holy One!<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a special kind of thing. When I go to the island, I have a certain degree of 'resonance' with the items formed by the 'desire mother tree'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But before in Beckland, in Thuringia, there was no abnormal reaction to the relics left by the gods.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, I have divined over the fog beforehand, and the revelation is that the death of the tramp is coincidental, non-mythological creatures or '0' seal arrangements, The result is not like this...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, this is the first time the divination above the fog was really disturbed? Let me be unawarely Interference?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s thoughts were a stagnation and found that this was the most serious problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before involving "0-08", he just didn't get effective revelation, not the result was disturbed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, is the power of the "0" level of seals? “Desire Mother Tree” interferes personally, and is itself a true god? However, it is difficult for the Seven Gods to directly influence the real world. There must be corresponding rituals... Well, I also have the danger of divination playing Amyrius on the fog. The revelation gained is affordable, and the development of this matter The results are exactly the same, which has not been disturbed? Klein wants to think that the whole thing is full of fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he most wants to understand is that if the target of pollution is himself, why is he almost untested by too difficult, it is relatively simple to solve problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the arrangement of "Desire Mother Tree" like a joke! When Klein was about to crush Fulett Ken, he asked questions again, confirming his guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite surprising to him that this week, the celestial sect has never held a ceremony to pray for the "desire mother tree" to interfere with divination, nor has it failed to plan for failure. What special arrangements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weird... Klein pulled out a gold coin and let it pop up and make a final confirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even without divination, he is almost certain that Follett Ken is not lying, because the spirit of the other party has collapsed and does not have the ability to weave reasonable rhetoric. Second, the answer of Follett Ken is logical, and some of Klein’s deliberately did not say. The details are consistent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! The gold coins fell to the palm of the spread, and the king’s head looked up, affirming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with the divination statement, Klein finally determined that Follett Ken did not lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Temporarily depressed the doubts in his heart, he looked back to Follett Ken, without a smile: <br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What have you done against the laws and social customs of the kingdom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flatett. Ken took a few seconds, mental state It seems that I am getting better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his view, the plan related to Admiral Amyrius is the most serious crime, the most prone to anger the big man in front of him, the others are just some Small problems, it is not worth the deities to pay attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, skipping the important part and coming to the general topic means that he may have a good ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flater. Ken couldn’t help but reveal a less obvious smile and confessed to it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I used to torture other people's property, tortured their family for a night, and killed them into the jungle. Then, using forged documents, they got a lot of wealth.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I deliberately induced many believers to indulge their desires and watch them become the nourishment of the 'desire mother tree' step by step in the emptiness and remorse after the event. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have deceived a lot of ladies to help them liberate their nature and gain spiritual redemption as an excuse to take possession of them.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I tortured some believers who tried to rebel to death, mainly by cutting off all the protruding things on them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He confessed his crimes one after another, and did not seem to want to have any concealment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein couldn’t believe it, he never I thought that human nature would be so bad.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fleet. Ken said that the more excited he was, the more he saw Admiral Amyrius standing facelessly. Get up, walk around the desk, walk to your front, lift your left palm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the left palm, cracked a terrible mouth, two The illusory teeth are white, cold and cold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...no! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scream of horror and horror echoed in the study, and did not calm down for a long time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a while, Klein bent over and picked up a gray-light group like a miniature brain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the extraordinary feature of "mad"!<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes him unfortunate is that before Fredette Ken was brought over, he had already encountered a body search without leaving any cash and items.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;啪! Klein snapped a finger and ignited all the pieces of clothing left behind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the initial healing of the left shoulder, he sat back at the back of the desk. Silenced for a long time in the red flame of quiet prance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all traces are no longer obvious, he pulls the corresponding rope and shakes the bell outside the door.响.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde secretary Rueran lifted the "ban" and opened the door, instinctively examining the next corners.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Command The Guards and the base personnel, in conjunction with the Olavi police system, will clean up the Celestial sects. It is best to find clues and arrest some members of the Rose School. "Klein calmly reached the order.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Lord General. "Lurnan responded reverently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't ask where Follett. Ken went, just as the leader of this celestial sect never existed.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrest of Olawi Island, Klein did not pay too much attention, and was pushed off on the grounds that he suffered a slight injury. All the arrangements for the next two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that he no longer has to worry about how to show the majesty of the "arbitrator" route at a critical moment after losing the "ninth law" spell. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Admiral, Mr. Auston has not yet taken a passenger liner, the new Governor Ben Conrad sent an invitation to invite you to attend him tonight Banquet." Near noon, Lueran knocked on the door and reported the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Conrad...the person who succeeded the Governor of Auston... As far as I know, the Conrad family is the loyalty of the royal family, the tower Lime should have known Prince Edessack in the process of being the eunuch teacher of the son of Conord.... Klein nodded lightly and entered the complex emotions of Amyrius Levitt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is silent for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Telling Governor Conrad, I am due to the celestial sect The attack, suffered a certain injury, was inconvenient to attend the banquet.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I apologize to him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Admiral. "Rul'an did not persuade and left the room calmly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One demigod is qualified enough to be "willful"!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as he does not participate in the plot and commits a serious mistake, he will not be blamed for doing anything, because any party is willing to accept a demigod!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When Lu’an’s back disappeared at the door, Klein shook his head and sat back behind the desk.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm day passed quickly, approaching In the early hours of the morning, Klein, who was lying in the room, suddenly woke up and turned to sit up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His inspiration told him that someone had entered the house!<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stared at the window and saw a middle-aged man in a tuxedo suit. He had dark blue eyes and a slight drooping corner. It was Admiral Amirus. !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, he finally came back... Klein slowly stood up and cautiously asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;"What items did you give me beforehand? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is worried that Admiral Amyrius is also disguised as a "no face".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Admiral Amyrius stood there, replied with a serious expression: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The ninth law' spell. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unequal to Greman. Sparo once again spoke, he went two steps forward and calmly asked:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened in the past few days? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Klein controls his facial muscles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your secretary Made a mistake and suffered some injuries. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm? anything else? Admiral Amyrius nodded deeply and indulgently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein tried not to let his gaze move away, looking directly at the other side:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your brother was dismissed from the Governor's post and the new Governor has arrived. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Miss Cynthia became a monster and was purified by me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your part of the Guard and the servant's servant are infected and are being treated..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "..." Amyrius's expression was a little bit confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyeballs are fretting and seem to be wondering if he is back in the wrong place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only three days! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
