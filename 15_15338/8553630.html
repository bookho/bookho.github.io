			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment on the line of sight, Llanus bent over and rolled forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tarot card with an angel and a horn is like a flying knife, sharply inserted into the wall of the sewer, and its position is just as high as before. Llanus's neck is flush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! when! when! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhous or tumbling, or leaping, or fluttering, the action is agilely avoiding the three cards that are successively connected, let them and the wall The surface, with the slate, collided with the cement, and the metal was knocked back. At the same time, he used the corner of his eye to see that the man wearing the clown mask was not much slower than himself, holding the thick hand in one hand. The cascading cards are hand-carded with one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun with the five senses on the paper came into view. Lalhous left his hand on the wall and the whole person leaped and changed dramatically. to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he heard a groaning sound, and his ankle suddenly suffered a sharp pain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send two cards? A little lag, just in the direction I am avoiding? Can he predict my movements? Lanerus had a glimpse of his heart, and once he landed, he endured the pain and rolled again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his original position, he inserted a tarot card and a trembling tarot card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, Llanus only aimed at the ankle on his right side, deeply embedded in a card with stars, water bottles and holy water Has been dyed bright red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhous had no chance to think about and deal with the injury. One by one, the tarot card turned into a sharp flying knife and shot at his body. Different parts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the injury to the right foot and the left chest, the residual influence of the cavity between the chest and the abdomen, the previous at least half-level collision, let the sequence 9 be " The thief, who is known for his speed and agility, began to become sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! A card was hit by him, but his wrist was cut out of deep wounds and bloody wounds continued to flow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night and military personnel will soon catch up and can’t delay! At this moment, Llanus’s mind is very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he stopped in place, no longer dodging, still hit a sign by a surface depicting the "Devil" accurately hit his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost instantaneously, the card that was inserted in him was flung out, and his neck, right chest, wrist, and ankle had a wound. The blood is creeping in a frenzy, growing one after another granulation, the shape of the disgusting granulation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhous's skin, suddenly bulging a small shackle, they are iron-colored, seemingly become a full body armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! A tarot came and was bounced off by the finers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyelids were stained with blood red Llanus looking at the opposite side to stop the action, the clown who picked up the cards, half-smiling and half-satisfied: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, after being so tossed by the gods, there is always something to gain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voice When he did not fall, he slammed his left foot and jumped over the filthy river, and rushed to the enemy opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wearing a "clown" mask flashed a step as expected. The left hand then pulled out of his pocket and clenched his fist into a fist. The shells rushed to the temples of Llanus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalus swayed his elbows sideways, erected his arm and accurately hit the opponent's fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent force of the torrential floods came, and Klein was driven to the body and his footsteps appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snapped! Snapped! Snapped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of cracking sound blasted in Klein’s ear, a note that was heavier than a note, and a fist that was faster than a record His eyes are wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have forgotten to maintain balance, slamming down to the side of the foot, and then using the support of the left elbow to roll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhous punched and kicked fast and fiercely. Klein was almost hit several times, but he always relied on exaggerated balance to counteract common sense. The action is lucky to dodge, he is sometimes on the wall, and sometimes on the ground, seems to be performing acrobatics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He performed very calmly, not at all impatient, as if he had made up his mind, to delay the battle as much as possible, and the equivalent night and military personnel to catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Llanus appeared to escape the road, he would inevitably entangle and give no chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhus punched Klein back to the trapeze with the bounce of the wall, and he did not hesitate to turn to escape from the other channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s toes on the toes, the body is about to fly out like a cannonball, straight to the vest of Lalus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, a picture suddenly appeared in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lan Uz, like no bones, forcibly turned the upper body back and punched him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an intuitive premonition of the "clown" ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no hesitation, without hesitation, Klein took the initiative to reduce the power of follow-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a bang, he still rushed out, but he was weaker than expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rubbing sound of the teeth, Lalus did not move his legs, and the upper body huddled back, his face facing the back and his toes pointing forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a horrified picture, Lanerus punched and rushed to Klein’s head, and the force violently blew into the air. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fist hits the void, and is still twenty or thirty centimeters away from Klein’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind that swayed blown Klein’s hair, but he didn’t take the opportunity to attack the enemy, but he mourned a deep and hoarse memory of a ancient Hermes Words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blush!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Character? Llanus jumped in front of the forehead and immediately rushed to the side to try to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, Klein did not throw the spell, but held the left fist tightly and followed Llanus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also rushed to the side, and also followed the roll, the distance between the two was only slightly opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is cheating me? Lanerus just flashed such a thought, and the eyelids clearly reflected the high-pitched corner of the clown and the dark red flame that was ignited in his left fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...Lalus’s gaze solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly slammed into his ear, the feeling of deep silence filled the moment, and shrouded Klein and him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does he want to do? He wants two people... at the same time to be affected... so that the follow-up...nights and military personnel... rushed to... Lalhous’s eyelids fell heavily, and he was forced to resist by the exhaustion and weakness of the previous pressure. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is trying to support the stage where he is not allowed to fall asleep and wants to rely on the special strength of the present body to survive the most intense sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of doing the slightest resistance, Klein quickly entered the sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, when he is not naturally asleep, he will instinctively wake up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his special place against "Psychic" and "Dream"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the reliance he had escaped from the life of Mrs. Xue Lun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the previous battle, he immediately took out the "Sleep Charm" after the card flying knife was invalid, and held it tightly in the palm, waiting for the opportunity to use. Waiting to influence yourself also affects the enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one moment, he was forced to break free from his dreams, and his eyes were clearly reflected in the swaying Llanus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call! Klein suddenly became very calm, just like a target in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a sigh of relief, turned his back, pulled his shoulders, stabbed his fist forward, and tried his best to pierce his fist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! Click! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fists were beaten in the throat position of Llanus, playing the sound of broken bones, playing the effect of flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhous stepped back two steps and stuck the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent pain finally got rid of the effects of sleep, but the fine iron enamel on his body all faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Klein hit a fist, his left hand had explored the pocket and pulled out two cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two tarot cards each inserted one of Llanus’s eyes, and the bloody liquid flowed down instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhous actually resisted this pain, without screaming screams, he rushed forward and made the strongest struggle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not have a homeopathic attack, and had expected to lean over the body and step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed by, the opportunity of 趁Lalousus to rush to the empty space, he rushed to the other side of the two steps, hands together, entangled the enemy's neck . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kline’s arms twitched and turned, and he broke the neck of Lalhous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, he took two steps back and looked at each other<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhous The eyes of the card were incapable of looking forward, and the body slowly fell down. At the same time, he asked with suspicion and intermittently: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To...kill...I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gazing with a clown mask The enemies in front of them replied quite indifferently: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No why."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No ......" Lanerus's eyes were round and round, and it was difficult to fall to the ground of the sewer. The breath finally dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, it seemed that Klein, who was very calm, stepped forward and tightened his right leg, kicking out his whole body and kicking it. On the head of Llanus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the bloody and fuzzy bones of the broken neck can no longer bear this pressure, Lalus's head flew out like a ball, hit the wall, Hit a red and white piece! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the scene and slammed his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha ha ha, ha ha ha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha ha ha ha ha ha."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
