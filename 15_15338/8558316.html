			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method of separating the mental pollution of the out-of-control person from the extraordinary characteristics... "The hidden person" Jia Delia looked at the "world" and guessed that the other party might be holding one Two extraordinary characteristics left behind by the loser, and one of the big probabilities involves the promotion of the "world" or the promotion of his close associates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very easy reasoning, because if you don’t use extraordinary features as the main material of the potion, it is not a key issue to have any mental pollution left by the loser. At most, the magical items produced are extremely negative, equivalent to seals, but that is not impossible to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein adjusting the mood to manipulate the "world" hoarsely responded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Write to On paper, pass it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Klein wanted to encourage the little "sun" and praised him as a person who kept his promise, but again Considering that the image of the "world" is gloomy and introverted, there is no extra purpose and no nonsense, and there is some hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, there are additional purposes... Let the little "Sun" keep his rules of being a man. Many things will be easier in the future. In short, it is more It is easy to lick wool... Of course, you have to bear the harm caused by his honesty and honesty... The "world" is an experienced and extraordinary person in the eyes of Miss "Justice" and "Down Man". Don't pay attention to similar problems... Thoughts turn around, Klein makes the "world" send a low laugh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a person who keeps promises, you The character is appreciated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&#;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am also very interested in this knowledge. What can I exchange for it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is planning to If the price is not high, the transaction will be made. If the price exceeds the psychological expectation, it will be abandoned. It is not used at present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly praised Dairik is immersed in the joy, and he has been thinking for two seconds, and he said with sincerity:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. 'Inverted Man', no need, you always give me advice, help me face difficulties, this is my thanks."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......If the "world" is a real person and is drinking water, this moment must have sprayed all the liquid in his mouth. Fortunately, he is not drinking water, he is not a real person," The fool, Klein, used the extraordinary ability of the "clown" to reluctantly restrain the changes in facial expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." "The hanging man" did not know what to say for a short time, and the answer of "Sun" completely exceeded his expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been wandering for so many years at sea, and has experienced a lot of things, and his ideas have long since changed from black and white to gray, but For a moment, there was a bit of awkwardness inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your character is really appreciated." Alger quickly returned to normal and praised the little "sun". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't learn to talk to me! Can't change one sentence... The "world" sweeps the "downside down", and the "fool" sighs in the dark. The old fritters are the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stupid! No, it’s stupid than stupid, stupid sheep! "Moon" Emlin silently smashed the "sun" sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this morning, he is full of expectations for this Tarot meeting, because he has been successfully promoted to the Baron, looking for opportunities to show off without revealing . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may not see it, except for the "fool" Mr.... "The hanging man" should be able to guess... I have to wait for something to do, let them I know that I am already a noble Baron....Emlin is listening and thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the little "sun" words, "justice" Audrey is not embarrassed and angry, because she is very clear, each time responsible for guiding each other is mainly " Mr. hangs down, Mr. himself and others only occasionally give some advice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing a good person will naturally have a good return... I hope that Mr. "Pin Hanger" can become more kind from now... She looks at the opposite with joy. For the time being, there is no impulse to spend money on the cost of separating the spiritual pollution within the extraordinary characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein manipulated the "world" and took one. He couldn't wait to scan it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two ways, one is to use items that can steal other people's extraordinary abilities, The mental pollution left by the controller is stolen, and then the extraordinary characteristics are blended into potions before the stealing expires. As a result, the mental pollution will not return, but will disappear directly.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second is to arrange the ceremony, pray to one of our two powerful magical items in Silver City, use its feedback to smash the extraordinary characteristics, let the spiritual pollution evaporate, after which the extraordinary characteristics will slowly gather on their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can only get the corresponding ritual process, I can't get an accurate description of that item, only the elders of the six-member board are qualified to understand, and Host a similar ceremony.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ritual process is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm... Klein’s mind I have a lot of thoughts and almost forgot to manipulate the "world" of the dummy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first method is indeed what I did not expect before... after the door of Chanis in Tingen The seal 'Vascular Thief' can steal the extraordinary ability of the target, treating mental pollution as one of them, logically no problem...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the problem is, The spiritual pollution in the 'All Black Eyes' is not ordinary and extraordinary. It comes from the evil god 'real creator'. Whether it is the extraordinary person who masters stealing ability or the magical item with similar nature, it is difficult to withstand such spiritual pollution. The former 100% out of control on the spot, the latter will be directly polluted...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In theory, you can sacrifice a similar magical items, use it instead of 'black Eye' is contaminated, can grasp the timing must be right enough, there must be no mistake, otherwise both will be contaminated. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quickly analyzed the feasibility of the first approach, and the second approach was close to his previous inferences and Edwina’s guess. , but the details are different.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two powerful magical items in Silver City are at most '0', which is basically impossible. The legacy of sequence 0, otherwise, they will not be so embarrassed in the land of God, so, can you think that crushing extraordinary characteristics does not necessarily require the power of the gods, angelic enough? According to the small 'sun', in the second era, the angel is equal to God, and is barely a god...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm... there is something to prove this Point, 'Poseidon' Cavitowa only got some of the characteristics of 'natural disasters' Gao Shinam, and the rest is in the book of Scourge... There may even be a third part, I don’t know where it is hidden, help that The angel-level upper elf died without being stiff. In short, it can be seen that the extraordinary character of Gao Shinam is divided into at least two parts, which is the same as the essence of crushing extraordinary characteristics.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Previously, it can be determined that as long as the ceremony is appropriate, the feedback of the angel-level power can also smash the extraordinary characteristics, then the question comes, where can I find an angel...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Azick may be at the height of his life, but now it is obviously not yet restored, still at the holy level, 'The Snake of the Destiny' Will Wealthing is currently only a fetus, both Not yet born."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't think much It is decided that Tarot will end and consider the question of where to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, "Dang Hanger" Alger also quickly browsed again and had a certain grasp of the content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a guess based on this:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the 'world' find its own extraordinary characteristics The method of mental pollution inside should be the test of Mr. 'fool' to the deceased.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But can this also explain that the power of Mr. Fool's is currently only Return to the holy level, not yet to the angel level, otherwise there is no need to be so troublesome, you can remove it directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long does it take? Just seven months later, Mr. 'fool' has returned to this level... Yes, he can replace 'Poseidon' Cavi Tuva gave a response!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In another year or two, he should be able to get rid of the seal initially, standing at the top of the angel stage, only one step away from the ultimate goal. . ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
