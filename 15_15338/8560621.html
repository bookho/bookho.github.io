The two barons, one after the other, ran in the dark alleys and the edge of the dull streets, and arrived in the middle of the hour. The chaotic and dirty East Side, parked in front of an old apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rus Batori chooses to climb the pipe and travel to the third floor in the least way. Emlin slows down and does not eagerly affix to each other. Later, because it is easy to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughtfully for two seconds, he took out a translucent perfume bottle, unscrewed the lid, pressed down, and sprayed the liquid inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one effect of this potion, that is to eliminate the smell of itself, consistent with the surrounding! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the bottle in his hand, and Emlin took out a brass metal vial and slammed the liquid inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The Potions Professor' is really trouble..." He snorted and looked down at his hands, one inch and one inch became transparent, and the brass metal vial seemed to Floating in front of the cuff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Emrinse returned to the vial, there was only one suit, a top hat and a pair of unbuttoned and unbanded shoes, which formed a human form. , move around there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another fully transparent perfume bottle flies out and floats in the air, pressing it on its own, squirting the inner potion onto the clothing. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outlines of dresses, hats and shoes faded a little and eventually disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completing the "invisible" Emlin took a look at the room where Russ Bartoli entered, invisibly climbing the pipe and chasing it at the extreme speed Go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the window halfway, he was like a transparent cloud, did not produce a slight movement into the room, hiding in the corner, watching the face thin but Very tasteful Rus Batori looking for a target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter’s brows gradually wrinkled, because it’s empty, don’t talk about people, even mosquitoes that have been active in the last week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bloody baron can be sure that the "moon puppet" is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the sound of oh sounds, breaking the calming silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the room followed, and a woman in a long black dress walked in slowly, looking at Ruth Batori, saying in a whisper :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you looking for..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin looks at the sound, sees The skin color is deep, the eyebrows are slender, the contour lines are soft, and the corners of the mouth are drooping. It is the target Windsor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the eyes of Emlin, the "primitive moon" of the devout believer and her in the portrait has changed a certain degree, now her eyes Bend, the eyebrows are bent, and the mouth is bent, as if imitating the current blushing month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her forehead, her cheeks, her neck, her bare skin, all with dried hay and flowers, a cluster of one Clump, a flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Hey, what did Russ Bartoli sell to her? How can it become this look? Emlin was shocked and felt that the hair behind his neck had stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, on the ground, walls, doorways and ceilings, a cluster of hay grows out, mixed with dry flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They completely isolated this room from the outside world, creating a very strange scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snapped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dropped the bottle, and the body dragged out the shadows and rushed to the changing Windsor, his hands were nailed and his body was black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windsor inlaid with dry grass and dried flowers is like a large rag doll, welcoming at the same speed, completely ignoring the injury and catching a claw En Bartoli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a series of collisions, Russ Bartoli flew out and slammed into the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sleeves have been torn off, and scratches on the skin are visible on the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And between the flesh and blood, the dried hay and flowers are slowly growing out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a monster... Emlin first encountered this enemy and kept shrinking in the corner, almost forgot to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not appear recklessly, and all kinds of thoughts in his mind flashed quickly, while observing the battle between Rus Batori and Windsor, What kind of way to deal with such a situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weirdest are the hay and flowers...weeds and flowers...they should be afraid of fire! Emlin's heart moved, immediately gave up stealth, took out another metal vial, unscrewed the lid, and sipped it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, he squirted all the liquid in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray-red water droplets explode as soon as they encounter the air, and a hot flame extends to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire flames, flames and flames, instantly turn the room into a red ocean! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sound of the slap in the air, the dried grass and flowers are ignited one after another, and the companions are infected at a very fast speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just two or three seconds, the sealed environment was nearly destroyed, and the hay and dried flowers on Windsor began to burn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Russ Bartoli’s chest has been dug a big hole, losing most of his combat power, relying on the super-recovery ability of the blood family. maintain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the torch-like enemy, Emlin was keenly aware of the decline of the other's breath, and rushed to the past without hesitation, and even struck around Windsor. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soles of his feet, the black air rising up, the believers entangled in the original moon, just like the shackles of vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fierce and short-sounding voice, the two figures suddenly approached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the movements disappeared, and Emlin grabbed Windsor’s throat and lifted her up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hesitated for a second, seeing the other side squatting, he clicked and twisted the enemy's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slender, small puppet inlaid with dry grass and dried flowers fell from the body of Windsor, and the flame in the room gradually subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin pulled off the head of Windsor's variability, turned his body, and looked at Russ Bartoli, who was breathing heavily, pressing with his empty right hand. On the chest, there is a smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Lu Bartoli became angry and unable to snatch it. Emlin was very nice to make up two sentences:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember to put the puppet and precipitated The extraordinary characteristics are given to the adults of Nibes, they are very problematic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, he was black and condensed, and he grew two illusory bat wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After stepping on the ground, he put away the condensed black gas and looked back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Ruth Bartoli didn’t follow, Emlin sighed, clenched his fist against his mouth, coughing and whispering:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hate the flames, hate the smoke!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is about to stay away from the East, and the coolness behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin’s spirit was tense, carrying Windsor’s mutated head, turning slowly and looking into the shadow of the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first saw a small black shadow standing there, and then saw what the other person looked like:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The body is slender like a wooden stake, the eyes are bent into the moon, the surface is inlaid with a lot of dry grass and dried flowers, it is the "moon puppet" in the previous room! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s entangled with me...what is this item...here is far from the residence of the adults of Nibes...the outside is really dangerous...a The idea emerged in the mind of Emlin, which made his spine cool and his muscles tense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts flashed, he was inspiration, staring at the "moon puppet", whispered in ancient Hermes: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fool who does not belong to this era;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mysterious ruler above the fog;<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king of yellow and black who is in charge of good luck..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who doesn't sleep in the middle of the night!" Klein rolled over and sat down, slamming his forehead slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly left the bed, took four steps back, entered the fog, and sat in the position of the "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White? Klein glanced at him, confusingly spreading spirituality and touching the deep red star that represented the "moon." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately saw Emmalin, who was stiff, and saw the other side staring at a slender and puppet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The puppets are covered with rich but illusory blushing moonlight, they are gently undulating like tides, and are connected with something in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the blushing moonlight is spreading silently, shrouded to Emlin White. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a problem... This puppet question is not small... Seeing more Klein with the fog, he does not hesitate to let the "Poseidon Scepter" leave the debris pile, Fly into his own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue-blue gems at the top of the white-bone shorts are lit one after another, giving off a dazzling glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembering the name of Mr. Fool, requested assistance After that, Emlin only felt that the blood of the low temperature was getting colder and colder, and gradually became a feeling of condensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made his body stiff and stiff, and watched as the "moon puppet" walked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the half-empty inside the alley was silver and white, dispelling all the darkness and darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning was twisted into a group and landed on the Moon Puppet, drowning it in silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light flashed away, the strange puppet was blackened, lost the decoration, and the blood in the body was no longer frozen, and the flow was restored. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly got rid of the stiff, knowing that Mr. Fool is still watching here, whispering in a hurry:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
