			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson, who was afraid of Gilman Sparo’s remorse, grabbed the 5 Sule banknotes, and the mind appeared to be on the fire. Beef and alcoholic beverages without any sedatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, this guy actually accepted, I just said casually, and let him know that my money is not so good, lest he I don’t want to go hunting pirates, I’m going to borrow a lot of money and go straight back to the foggy sea... Klein sighed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his view, a sequence of 5 "hunters", in a lot of pirates, even if there is no penny on the body, will not be hungry to themselves, no Place to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head invisibly, was about to leave the dock forward, and suddenly there was a rough cry behind him:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... heard that Frank Lee’s voice, Klein, shuddered, nervously Turned back to the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first officer of the "Future", the "toxin expert" who has a reward of 7,000 pounds, stands on the side of the ship, his hands are on his lips, like Asked in a loud voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where do you often appear? Where should I write?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I want to share my latest research with you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to know... This guy has not identified many friends, and I bet that most of the friends he thinks are not really He is a friend... Well, the inner feelings of "Stars above" are more biased towards the "mysterious queen", and there is not enough sense of belonging to Tarot. Bright and honestly develops a 25-year-old child around her. No, the source of intelligence is conducive to Shocking her, it is the level of the knocking of the German Sparrow... With this preparation, it is more reasonable and natural for Mr. Fool to knock it again... Kline’s thoughts are sharp and he takes it out of his pocket. A note paper and a water-absorbing pen for divination.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote a call for his messenger, and did not forget that there must be a gold coin in the ceremony material.嗖 嗖 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good! Frank Lee took a look at the information on the paper and waved his hand with delight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein no longer delayed, carrying a suitcase, leaving the dock, looking for Hotel.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, he originally wanted to firmly reject Anderson’s proposal to live in the same hotel, but after thinking about it, he still agreed.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is afraid of the problem of this doom-ridden guy, bringing disaster to the innocent customers and waiters in the hotel, so he plans to monitor it nearby, and the decisive treatment will be decisive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With good accommodation, Anderson took the key and opened the door to his room,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰He took off his heavy burden and sat down in the easy chair.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the dangerous sea, he finally found the feeling of being a man, no longer Worried that it would die at any time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quietly lying for a while, Anderson Hood slowly got up and picked up the shell Iron thermos, turned over the glass, poured himself a cup of hot water.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks he should go to the bar and wander around:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink some wine, fill your stomach, find funding!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until the hot water is cool, Anderson picks up the cup He made a squeaking voice and he was very happy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, he coughed hard and coughed his face with a little purple.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough! Cough! Cough!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson reached out and grabbed his throat, and seemed to be unable to breathe in one breath. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a click, the glass fell from his hand and fell on the floor, falling apart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cough and cough... Anderson's coughing voice is getting weaker and weaker, and a face has already swelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, his eyes fainted in the light, and the blue veins on the back of his hand seemed to wriggle like his own life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson fell to the ground, twitched a few times, and immediately lost his movements, and even the breathing seemed to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, the dead body-like Anderson suddenly rolled over and sat up, and then touched his face with fear:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard, I almost died of drinking water...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, I can probably be the most funny hunter of death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, fortunately, before I entered the sea, I bought this for a big price, and today it finally came in handy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, Anderson took out a straw-like doll from the vest lined with the vest, and painted two eyes and one ink with ink. Nose and a mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of this doll has been corroded, dropping the dark liquid drop by drop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took seven or eight seconds to completely melt into a liquid and become a stain on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This bad luck has not diminished, and it seems to be more ferocious... Hey, Spal Sparrow has conveyed a prophecy to me, saying the most The fatal danger is often hidden in the most common life.” Anderson paced back and forth, carefully avoiding the glass slag under his feet, fearing that another death would result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you must save yourself! Save yourself!" Anderson slammed the door open and walked out cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came all the way to the room at Klein, squeezing his fingers and knocking at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the wooden door that was neither strong nor heavy opened without any sound, only the German Sparrow who took off the long dress coat appeared In front of Anderson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson squeezes a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surprise?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was closed in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." He first glimpsed, and immediately said with a stiff expression, "I have to adjust the way I speak."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again sounded Klein’s door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was quickly opened and a revolver was aimed at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, I want to ask, do you have an extraordinary person who knows how to help people to transfer?" Anderson raised his hands halfway, madly suggesting that Germans Paro said the strong who offered the prophecy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be late, the "mysterious queen" already doesn't know where to go... Hey, she didn't give me a contact method? However, since the messenger ceremony of my messenger was known to Frank Lee, it is equal to "the star above", which is equal to Bernard, and, after returning to Bakerland, you can ask Miss Sharon for help." The mysterious queen is in her circle, although the frequency is not high... Kline pityfully looks at Anderson Hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t like the strongest hunter. He always arranges each other in his heart and shows all kinds of maliciousness. After all, the sleeve nail is lost, and the other party is responsible for half. However, he is limited to thinking about it. He has no intention of putting it into practice. He really wants to ask for help from the other side, and he will not directly refuse it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein considered the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can help you ask, give you tomorrow morning Answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I doubt if you have the ability to pay. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go to the bar and wait for a turn! Moreover, I still have a lot of private collections in the misty sea. Anderson responded without hesitation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded and said as he closed the door:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See you tomorrow morning, I hope you can live to that time."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is locked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you a curse, or a blessing?" Anderson whispered a bitterly. "According to my experience, there will be no more chances in the last two or three days. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, Klein returned to the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a letter that has just opened and a paper crane that has been dismantled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Anderson’s question, Klein had already thought about it before answering the question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The best way to understand a "snake of destiny" is undoubtedly another "snake of destiny"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pondered the area after the spread of the thousand paper cranes and the questions he wanted to ask, first drafted the draft in his heart, and then filed the pencil path. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to eliminate the curse of doom brought by the 'Destiny Angel' mural?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' What is the name of the 4th Potions corresponding to the Divination? Where can I get its recipe and main material? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the pencil, Klein took a hard look at the content twice, then carefully folded the paper cranes back according to the creases and stuffed them into the wallet.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, he continued to write a letter to Mr. Azick.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter Klein first mentioned that he had entered the dangerous area in the easternmost part of the Sunia Sea with the help of the "Star above" and successfully completed the ceremony. Then he turned around and said that he had encountered "Hell Admiral" Ludwig in the middle of the journey. There was no reason to attack, and he almost lost a lot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this topic, he began to describe the ring of the suspected ancient death relic in the hand of "Hell Admiral", very Intimately ask Mr. Azke if he has any impressions on whether he needs to get a look at it in order to evoke more memories.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After clicking this Klein also talked about the "artificial death" plan of the "spiritual group" in a chattering manner, and curiously asked Dalat whether this is Feasibility, whether the previous documents have specific details.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In turn, I don’t know the situation of the subsequent sequence, and I don’t know exactly where to get it. Opportunity, Klein used the strokes of the travel notes to tell the dangerous seawaters that were summed up in this journey.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is providing information for Mr. Azke, lest The other party suddenly wanted to go there to find the breath of the ancient death, but did not know what the potential dangers were.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It is said that the sea is full of ' The true creator's proverb, the higher the sequence, the clearer the hearing, the more susceptible it is, the more mad or the out of control, which is based on the sequence 4... but there are also a small number of demigods who have found a way to move freely there... Klein wrote at the end of the letter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folding the paper, he picked up the Azick copper whistle and summoned a huge white bone messenger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger drilled from the floor, On the ground, Klein, spread out the palm of his hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good... Klein gave a sigh of praise and gave the letter to the other party.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he brushed his teeth and sat comfortably in the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, he was awake in his dreams and saw the ridiculous plains and the dark spires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family came to the depths of the minaret, and Klein found Will Ansett’s reply among the scattered Tarots:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friendly reminder: The paper crane is breaking!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The curse of the doom brought by the mural to find Ricciard It can be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
