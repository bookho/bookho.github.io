			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Klein’s answer, Elizabeth suddenly got a little nervous and unconsciously speeded up the speed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What is the reason for me to divination? If you can divinate the solution, it will be better..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divination can give The direction of the solution, but also full of symbolic, ambiguous, easy to interpret the wrong kind... Of course, you are very lucky, I am not just a simple divination, or a true mysterious scholar... Klein has a girl The two questions, solemnly and seriously said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since it is related to dreams, then I suggest using the divination method in this respect."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, okay." Elizabeth chick nodded eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein maintains a serious professional paradigm: "I need you to sleep here, reproduce that dream, no problem?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, I believe in you." Elizabeth licked her lips and answered without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she quickly stuttered and added: "But, but I can't guarantee, I will definitely do that dream."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a try." Klein calmed the other with a gentle smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he pointed to the couch on the side of the "Red Onyx" divination room: "Please."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, I am sleeping here." Elizabeth shook her head gently, posing with her hands crossed. "When I feel tired in the school, I will sleep in the interval of class." "For a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said that she used her arms as a pillow, leaned forward and leaned over to the edge of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, you can pretend that I don't exist." Klein smiled and observed the other's gas field and emotional color to determine whether the girl fell asleep successfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Elizabeth closed her eyes and buried her face in her arms, trying to make her breathing even. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t talk anymore, leaning back against the back of the chair, and the room suddenly became very peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a calming mind, forgetting the peace of the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, confirming that Elizabeth was asleep, Klein took a semi-circular silver sheet from his pocket and covered it. Hermes words that are difficult for ordinary people to understand and symbols, numbers, and symbols that are symbolic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "dream charm" that Klein made successfully yesterday morning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he also completed two "Sleep Charms", two "An Soul Charms", the former uses rectangular silver sheets, The latter is triangular so that he can be distinguished by the feel of the hand in a fierce battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blush!" Klein whispered and read a word in ancient Hermes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the opening spell he set, because there is a follow-up spiritual link, so there is no need to be different from others, as long as it is suitable for memory and short enough. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the echo of the mysterious voice, Klein felt the palm of his "dream charm" become light and seemed to lose weight for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the spiritual infusion, he immediately placed the spell on the table in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transparent flame whispers silently, enveloping the spell, burning a deep, quiet black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black is flying fast, and it will cover Klein and Elizabeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein seized the opportunity to enter the state of meditation, using spirituality to see a illusory elliptical ball of light in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a flawless dark black around the ball of light, which makes it very lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not dare to delay, immediately spread spirituality, and touched the ball of light that was not true enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the scenes around him began to turn upside down, but quickly fixed as a yellow-brown plain, with horses and humans on the plains. There are blood and weapons everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth wearing a lamb-length sleeved court dress, wearing a hat with a tulle hanging down, is looking around in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She caught Klein’s figure and her face smiled with a surprise smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Mr. Moretti, we met again! When I went to the Divination Club to find someone to divination, I suspected that the Klein Moretti on the roster was you, and then I went a few times. But because you usually have classes, and your time is always staggered..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I put in the summer vacation, I became free, but I was brought to my father and mother. The town of Ramde is on vacation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can help me, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the girl’s slogan, Klein was a little bit stunned for a short time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Elizabeth had long suspected that I was working part time at the Divination Club, and I also deliberately came to A few times...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just did not show any abnormalities! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the surprise is real, just concealing the real idea...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, everyone is honest in their dreams, except for my "fool" Mr....<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a lot of thoughts, and Elizabeth’s dream has changed. The tall knight, who is more than one meter tall, dragged the broad sword that touched the ground and walked step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight was wearing black full-body armor, and there was a slight metal collision in the action. Two flames of red light passed through the gap of his visor. Out, staring at Klein and Elizabeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​a resentment...not the extent of evil spirits... Klein, who is in a spiritual state, does not need to turn on the vision at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the division of the internal data of the night, the residual resentment and unwillingness are the weakest and most easy to deal with the soul thing, followed by the shadow and the soul. Evil spirits belong to very tricky soul monsters, and the most horrible evil spirits are said to be weaker than those with high sequence strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein stepped forward and stopped in front of Elizabeth, and then he stepped on his right foot, making the dream instantly fragmented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless fireflies-like lights, and Klein’s spirituality has returned to his body, allowing his eyes to re-visit the dimly lit “red agate” divination room. I saw a table with various divination props and saw the "dream charm" that only left a little ember after burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at this scene, thinking that the spells in the field of the night goddess are made of sterling silver, Klein couldn’t help but feel distressed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stuff is burning money! Even if I don't consider my labor costs, I can count 6 to 8 Sule on average. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, think about the extraordinary people of the eternal pilgrimage church, feeling a lot of balance, after all, they are burning gold...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The corresponding metal in the solar field is gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Elizabeth gently "hmm", slowly woke up, and re-sit straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Klein a little evasively:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moretti, there Does the divination result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Klein is quite serious. "No more than a week, the nightmare will disappear on its own."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will report to the captain and let him send people to the town of Ramd in time to deal with it... Klein added something he didn’t say in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? Great! Thank you, Mr. Moretti!" Elizabeth became excited and excited, then frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Klein asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing, just thinking that you must go home." She slowly took out the 1 Soler banknote that had been prepared and placed it on the table. Then, with a hat, he bid farewell to Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the "Red Onyx" divination room, she walked lightly to the stairs outside the gate, making sure that when no one saw it, she hurriedly swayed both arms. Whispered: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good hemp, good hemp..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Black Thorny Security Company, Dunn slammed his forehead and stared at the opposite Klein Road:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you suddenly returning, have you encountered any extraordinary events?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Captain, how do you dislike the tone... Klein cleared his throat and answered without hesitation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Dunn Smith once again licked his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein replied clearly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two things, one is before me When I went to the underground trading market to buy the spell material, I found that the 'monster' Admiral was curled up in the corner, fearing to tremble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here, He frantically suggested that material costs need to be reimbursed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the detective expenses of Dust Goodlin, because of the red chimney, he did not mention it, and deeply regretted that there was no Entrusted to two detective agencies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun seems to have not heard the hidden meaning of Klein, and nodded lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What happened to Admiralol?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein breathed a sigh of relief, describing in detail:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Ademisol made a dream, dreaming of the blood of the earth, the dead people in the land, including himself, so he was scared very badly."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun seems to be thinking slowly and slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As a diviner, what do you think this symbolizes?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A disaster, a disaster that has a wide range of problems, but there is no other information, and the dream of Admiralol may not be available for every one. Symbolic." Klein replied with discretion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will submit it to the church to see what they will give." Dunn shook his head and said, "This is not something I am good at."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has no other ideas, but instead talks about Elizabeth’s entanglement with the spirit of resentment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ramd Town... Is the lady a believer in the goddess?" Dunn asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Klein gave a positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no problem, you and I will go to the town of Ramde now and try to have dinner there, um, bring Frye, dead body In the events related to ghosts, his ability is very useful." Dunn glared at the temple and tried to think about what he had forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If Elizabeth does not believe in the goddess of the night, she must hand over to her “passing the penalty” or “mechanical heart” according to her specific beliefs, if her faith Even within the three churches, it belongs to the “mechanical heart” responsible for the suburbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t talk anymore, waited quietly for a while, and finally heard Dunn add:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Also, we are three people acting and can apply for the seal '3—0782'.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
