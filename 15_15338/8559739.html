			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "sun" in the focus of the line, Dairik, is not cramped and can’t wait to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" During this time, I followed the exploration team led by the 'Chief' to the afternoon town.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the only way to go to the 'Giant Wang Ting', this is The door to separating myths and reality. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His beginnings have well attracted the interest of the members of the Tarot Society, and they have waited differently for their respective positions.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick omits the less important experience along the way, directly from the town to the afternoon, first describes the dark and dead scenes there, then talks about how the three-person team found the basement altar How did he distinguish the names of Uluos, Medici and Saslier, and unwittingly entered the other side of the town, seeing the title of "dark angel" and the phrase "redeeming roses".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he once again thanked Mr. "The Fool" and thanked him for helping him out of trouble.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Dyke briefly introduced the monster that turned into his own shadow, focusing on the confessional priest in the half-collapsed church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used My own words recount those sentences, and when the priesthood wants to say the name of the fourth angel, suddenly It was burned to a gray ash by a transparent flame.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And know the king of an angel! And the atmosphere of the afternoon town is really gloomy and scary, the priesthood Confession is very good, um, the feeling of a disaster prophet... Audrey listened with great interest and was very curious about the two blanks and the two names that could not be said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At this time, "Sun" Dairik sideways, looking to the top of the bronze long table, devoutly asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'fool' Who tempted the 'dark angel' Sasliel? Who is the fourth name? Why can't you say it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come... Klein's smile after the fog was almost stiff.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in a hurry Throwing the little "sun" back into the real world is afraid of asking him a similar question!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, he was worried about the small "sun" asking "dark angel" Syler is related, and now I am suffering from a problem that I don’t know the answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the magician does not perform unprepared performances, after that day, Ryan undoubtedly seriously considered how to answer similar questions. At this time, he had a bottom in his heart, his right palm was lightly on the armrest, and his eyes were full of meaningful smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it is hidden. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used his own eyes and physical movements to hint at the hidden secrets of the "hidden" abnormal words of the Tarot members, with deeper and more specific fingers. Generation, but what is it, you understand yourself, the gods have deep hidden meanings.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing this series of actions, Klein couldn’t help but repent in his heart. I think that I am more and more fascinating. At the same time, he also feels that the "hidden" peep is sometimes attributed to his own induction, because "fool" will use the eyes and body movements to make additional tips, all Members will subconsciously observe his attitude.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a no-brainer, not relying on these, how can I pretend... I am not really evil! Klein’s heart is awkward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden? The name itself is equal to the secret? The content of Mr. Fool’s wish is here? The name itself is equal to the secret. What about the true god of sequence 0? Jay thought a lot in a moment, and combined with some of the things that were described before the little "Sun", there was some speculation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the name itself became secret, then Explain that this matter involves the true God, and it is very likely that there is a "night goddess" to participate because she is the "hidden mother"! The extremely dangerous dark side of "the land of God's abandonment" confirms this point... "The Hidden" Jia Deli Ya made inaccurate inferences based on her own knowledge and the prompts of Mr. Fool.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, she is almost certain that the Holy The great disaster referred to by the staff is the “catastrophe” that ended the third era.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tempted king of angels, the inhabitants of the fallen afternoon town, was smashed by a little bit of a corrupt city-state, a black "flower of disaster", which buried an era and created a "land of gods"... A heavy sense of history... Jia De Li Ya could not help but feel a few words in my heart. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tarot will consider the members of the group, "Footer" Klein is also analyzing why the name is blank why can not be said: <br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it the true name of the gods? The temptation 'The Dark Angel' is the true God of Sasril, and the king of the angel represented by the fourth name has become the true God later?<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, I haven't said the true name of the gods, 'The original witch' Chik is recognized as a level with the Seven Gods. As a result, nothing is happening...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe related to the language used? Lun, Intis, Foss, and even Gussack are languages ​​that cannot incite natural forces. And the giant language of Silver City can be, that priesthood should be used in this language.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try back and use the giant language to read Chik? Then, on the spot, he died, he succeeded... It’s forgotten, and a name is blank and a name can’t be said, and the performance is different... I don’t know why. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, seeing the little "sun" ignorant and confused, can't understand the meaning of Mr. "fool", "After hanging people" Alger actively explained :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two names may represent two gods, so they can't be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe the 'real creator' tempted the 'dark angel' Saslier, which led to the fall of several angel kings and afternoon town residents, bringing one A huge disaster, so only He has a temple and a god in your 'land of God'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fourth name corresponds to the king of angels In the disaster, I got great benefits and successfully promoted to be the true God. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is similar to my guess, but it is not certain that the "hidden" Jia Delia did not add, she does not think that she The speculation of "downside down" is the truth of the matter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey, "Magic" Firth and "Moon" Emlin While listening very seriously, while involuntarily sighing in the heart to discuss similar things, Tarot will always look particularly high-end, what the king of angels, what evil gods, what ancient secrets, is just a noun.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way... I understand. "The Sun" Dairik has a clear understanding, and once again sincerely thanked the "fool".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is about to turn back to the body, suddenly remembered a piece Things, some worries ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. 'Footer', the key to leaving the 'land of God' is really in the 'Giant Wang Ting'? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For so long, he has accepted the "inverted man" Mr. about the area where Silver City is located is "the land of God."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think so, but the problem is that I can’t be sure... I don’t look for the beach, but instead explore the “Giant Wang Ting”, it should be “Shepherd” Luo According to Weiya's proposal, this can prove my judgment from the side, but it is not a conspiracy... The "fool" Klein's smile is once again close to stiffness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His thoughts turned sharply, and he quickly thought of a way to not have to make a positive answer and would not lower the position of Mr. Fool.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately smiled easily. Aside, looking sideways at the "hidden" Jia Delia:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking of this matter, oh, Bernard has already known how to enter the 'God Earth'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia De Li Ya immediately recalled the dreamy picture of the vaguely remembered, subconsciously looking to the top of the bronze long table:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is that projection? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't finish her words, and suddenly she was alert that she was looking at the "fool", and quickly closed her eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, my 'eye of the eye' is instinct, can only be strengthened, can not be closed, must rely on magical items to seal ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
