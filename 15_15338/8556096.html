			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the half-collapsed temple, only a few stone pillars are still intact, and together support a small half of the main hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cracked altar in the forefront of the main hall, with a dark, huge cross standing in the center of the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the cross, a naked man hanging upside down, his ankles, his thighs, his body, with obvious rusty nails, And accompanied by bright red blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick clearly knows that this is the image of the "fallen creator", but still can not help but sag the line of sight, looking at the target's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the face of the statue, nose, mouth, ears, etc. are more blurred, only the eyes are carved very clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Fallen Creator" closes his eyes as if he is suffering from guilt and suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remove your eyes, don't study the statue of the evil spirit!" "The Demon Hunter" Colin screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the chief lord." Several expedition team members quickly regained their sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Before today, although Baiyin City found many destroyed cities in previous explorations, and found some written records pointing to evil spirits, most residents I have never seen a so-called evil god statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the temple is not wide, and the exploration team quickly completed the inspection in two or three groups without any abnormalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Executive of the Six-member Council, seeing Colin, for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Go to the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he brushed out one of the two swords he carried and applied a plaster of silvery brilliance . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he took off a metal vial contained in the dark belt of the waist belt, pulled the stopper, and drank the potion inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Derick felt that the chief light blue eyes seemed to be brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploring the squad members have made the most careful preparations, step by step along the ladder to the left of the idol under the illumination of the four animal skin lanterns. The underground area travels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick turned to the position of the lantern, walked to the left front, carefully deep into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the footsteps of himself and his companions swaying out from the stone steps, creating a distant and empty echo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This echo is not disturbed, indicating that the absolute silence below, in the hearts of the various exploration team members, it is like knocking on the door, trying to open a I buried the secrets that I don’t know for many years, and this made their spirits have to be highly tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Derick finally saw the road ahead flattening and saw the newly discovered murals described by the contaminated Dak Rikins. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large murals of the murals exist on the walls on both sides, and they are simply colored, old, vicissitudes and bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick took a glance at it and was attracted by one of the murals:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the left front wall, the white cross stands in the center, surrounded by the black of the sea, flooding many humans who struggle to reach out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a "fallen creator" hanging upside down, rusted nails, bloody stains and no other gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in this mural, the "fallen creator" is suffering from black erosion, so that the whiteness of the cross is partially darkened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the picture, in the deepest part of the darkness, there are six ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top left corner is a girl wearing a black classical long skirt. Her clothes are stacked but not complicated, and there are many stars in the sky. Her body is more virtual. There are signs of swaying out, her face is blurred, and she seems to wear a mask without facial features. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around her, the darkness is surging, and a strange eye is looming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top is a young man with a pure white robe. His face is painted pure gold and has a radiant glow. Tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands held rot-green books and splendid spears, and the chest and vest were upside down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper right corner is a monster holding a trident, with an octopus-like head, round eyes and lightning bolts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feathers of countless birds make up its cloak, the darkness turns into a wave, and it holds its feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bottom right is a beautiful and feminine lady, her chest is high and bulging, naked outside her clothes, holding a rotten face in her arms The baby, under her feet, is black wheat, spring water that squirms, pussy herbs and wildly mated animals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below is the old man with a hood that reveals his mouth, wrinkles and white beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man holds an open book with an eye symbolizing omniscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first glance, this old man is the most normal, but the smile outlined in his mouth has an indescribable evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower left corner is a giant warrior wearing a broken armor. He is holding a long sword and sitting on the throne. The background is a dull evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mural means that when the Cataclysm is coming, the evil spirits climbed out of the abyss, and the "fallen Creator" suffered most of the guilt in order to save the world. Pain, and therefore there is a situation in which the symbol is eroded and the image changes... However, I think that He is the biggest evil god... Dairik carries the animal skin lantern, while walking, watching the mural on the wall, discovering with Dak The description of Rekins is basically the same. The core theme is that the area where it is located has not been abandoned by God. Instead, it has been blessed by the "creator" and maintained civilization in the last days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Dirk Riggs was only a brief mention before, far from the details of the murals themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick did not relax his own defense during the whole process. He was always wary of accidents and got the first place. Preparation for time response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the faint candlelight, explore the squad through a corridor, a hall, a room, deep into the underground area of ​​the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, there was a half-opened graystone gate in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside of the gate is a clump of mushroom-like beauty, they are slap-sized, the handle is white, the umbrella cover is bright red, and the crystal is dotted with dark gold. Spots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as you see these "mushrooms", the team members who explored the squad will have a strong appetite, just want to rush over, pull out a plant, and stuff it into the entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜咕噜, many people swallowed and swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, most of the people who can enter the exploration team have rich experience and a relatively good sequence. In the case of being reminded beforehand, someone immediately stood up. , whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is rotten flesh and hairy scalp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dairik knew the teammate and knew that he was Joshua, and there was a magical item that was acquired and successfully redeemed in a certain exploration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua stretched out his left palm with red gloves and pointed at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang! The earth trembled slightly and the flames spread two meters to the surrounding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fire subsides, the mushrooms have all disappeared, leaving only the little pieces of meat and blood, and the extraordinary ones who could not control themselves before are disgusting. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Demon Hunter" Colin did not interfere with the actions of the players, quietly watching it, and nodded from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can there be flesh and blood turned into a mushroom? Where is the flesh and hair?" Joshua retracted his left palm and wondered himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other team member boldly guessed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original inhabitants of the city?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s possible...maybe their death is pure flesh and hair...Dairick agrees in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly discussed, the exploration team was divided into several groups to clean up the halls outside the gray stone gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, they regrouped and slowly passed the door, ready to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the gate, it is an altar-like place, and the area around which the light is hard to reach is deep and dark, and I don’t know what to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above the altar, there is also a dark cross and a fallen "falling creator". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric, carrying the animal skin lantern, was recently taken, and the instinct glanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His gaze suddenly caught, because he found that the "fallen creator" statue here is different from the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its eyes are open! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white-eyed, black scorpion is like a life-like intruder looking straight ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒哒哒, Dairik heard the sound of a tooth collision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally thought which team he came from, but he soon understood that he was shaking himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he did not know enough about the harm of the evil spirits, this moment instinctively trembled in the teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒哒哒. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His teammates have similar reactions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a little powder floated, and "Hunter" Colin held his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of Thunder echoed, and Dairik and others violently woke up and got rid of the nightmare state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They still have to look around in the future, and there is a faint crying behind the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜,呜,呜..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜,呜,呜..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quietness of the tooth, the "hunter" Colin ordered unhurriedly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Derek, Joshua, you look around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek’s body is chilly with a cowhide lantern Hold the "Hurricane Axe" and, along with Joshua, slowly walk around the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the darkness is gradually dissipated by the light, they see a black shadow curling up behind the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first two steps, the shadow shows its original appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a seven or eight-year-old child, and the yellow hair is soft and supple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
