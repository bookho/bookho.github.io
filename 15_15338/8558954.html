			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the villa that shines in the dark, Klein made a few seconds of mental preparation before he got off the wagon and came to the gate along three steps. In the cluster of the general guards and waiter servants on both sides of the line, they entered the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Cynthia because there are others, the home clothes are conservative, Klein breathes a sigh of relief, keeps the serious and serious expression, and slowly moves closer to the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cynthia’s smile became more and more obvious, and the hair that fell down was smashed to the back of the ear, revealing a long white neck with no trace of the necklace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the secretary of Ruer and the members of the General Guards or go to the room where they live, or to disperse outside the guard house, Klein grabbed before Cynthia gave a hug, said Shen Sheng :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not have hot water, give me a quiet room, I need to stay alone for one night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Cynthia expressed her sorrow and doubts with her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked around and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the situation, I have to enter Very calm state to recover."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked, he raised his right hand, slightly pulling the cuffs, showing a distinct light granulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a poor physical condition and a certain abnormal reaction. It is an excuse for Admiral Amyrius to prepare for the previous tramp substitute to help him escape from Cynthia's closeness. Asking without revealing the problem, Klein deliberately gave "evidence" with the technique of "no face" in order to enhance persuasiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cynthia's mouth opened and almost screamed, but fortunately, she reached out in time and blocked the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem? Need to find a doctor?" Cynthia eased a little and immediately asked, and the concern was overwhelming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is the necessary price to get a strong power. I will be back to normal after two or three days of calm." Klein also found the reasons for the follow-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay." Cynthia was busy leading Klein to the second floor and taking him into the quietest room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the master bedroom, because she had a few incense sticks and sprinkled some pure luster, she never gave up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door closed, Klein slowly vomited, replaced the dressed general dress, and laid down on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the master bedroom not far away, Cynthia, who was worried and lost, took a hot bath and entered the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the ceiling without a focal length, and couldn’t help but remember the embarrassment of her father and mother a few days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They let her please Admiral Amyrius, it is best to be pregnant with his children, so that the family can get more Central Indonesia Naval fleet agent share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general’s heart seems to hide a lot of things, so that the body has some abnormalities... Cynthia thinks infinitely, and the thoughts gradually drift away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fell asleep without knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vagueness, she felt that her stomach was a little hot and her body was a little hot. In her dreams, she seemed to see a dark night sky dotted with stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them seems to feel her gaze, and it shines brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the refreshing Klein enjoyed The sumptuous but uncharacteristic breakfast, once again surrounded by the General Guards, came to the Olavy Naval Base and requisitioned the most luxurious and spacious office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the habit of Admiral Amerius, he will be alone for a period of two or three days to study and master his extraordinary ability to develop and develop his own extraordinary ability. More practical skills, so Kline will have a long time undisturbed, leaving only a few simple tasks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a quiet and spacious office, Klein or leisurely paces back and forth, or pulls out the books on the shelf, and from time to time stretched out into the pocket, touched the "ninth law" spell, let it exude an unusually deep majesty - this It was to let the blond secretary Rueran outside believe that Admiral Amyrius was not abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Klein was a little sleepy and planned to take a nap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he heard a loud knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very important thing... Klein frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy for Secretary Rueran to disturb the practice of Admiral Amyrius! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in." Klein converges on his emotions and screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handsome blond young man Rul'an twisted his handle and opened the door. The palm seemed to be holding a telegram. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed down the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Admiral, Bakerland's telegram.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Auston’s Governor’s post was dismissed and was temporarily held by the City Council Speaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that the new Governor will arrive today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auston Levitt was Dismissed the Governor’s post? Their plot has been discovered? Also, the "Twilight Hermits" came to warn me, no, Amyrius, that they have mastered the specific situation, and through the operation of certain members, the probability of a big change will be eliminated through a series of positions. Invisible...just warned the night before, they started to act today, they have been preparing for a long time... Well, only from the arrival of the new Governor today will be able to see this... Klein was shocked and immediately felt that this was reasonable. , <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He learned the posture of Admiral Amyrius in the face of major problems, took a few steps back and forth, said with a serious expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not make a statement, did not give any orders, it was extremely deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he actually didn’t think about what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a saying in our big food empire that "it is better to be quiet than to move". I don’t know if Russell has translated it... Klein is half-self-deprecating. I was thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lur'an looked up and looked at Admiral Amyrius. He didn't say much, and quietly left the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein is pacing again, thinking about what the real Admiral Amyrius is standing here and what choices he will make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important event outside of the expected situation. There is no corresponding plan, so Klein can only rely on the personality, experience and certain self of the information of Amyrius. The statement is brought in, to think about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a conservative person, even in the middle and low sequence, mixed in various ships, there are few adventurous moves... he thinks it is A Luen nobleman who values ​​the family's attention to their loved ones and attaches importance to their children's attention to emotions is a gentleman who is very popular with women. The amount is worthy of discussion. With his rank and identity, even if you change a curl, Will be loved by women and men, no, even more loved, at least the curls will not tell the jokes of the time... Klein has flashed a message and intertwined the image of Admiral Amyrius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this immersive substitution, he heard a loud knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Come in." Kline’s spirit is highly tense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde secretary Lueran opened the door and pointed out the outside:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Admiral, Ou Mr. Ston wants to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did Auston come over? Does he want to see Amirius seeking protection or is he dying? Klein’s eyes narrowed and he found himself having to make a decision for Admiral Amyrius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What will he do? After receiving the warning of the "Twilight Hermit", he should understand that the matter has been exposed, and the goal has long been prepared to keep him conservative. Character, choice can be imagined...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
