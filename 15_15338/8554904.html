			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark red round pen was placed, and Klein picked up the paper with the divination statement and leaned back against the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His lips twitched and whispered "Kaping's dinner today", over and over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words swayed over the silent, empty fog, and Klein's eyes quickly turned deep, and the eyes slowly hang down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a fragmented dream, he saw the spacious and elegant restaurant, saw the gold-plated ceramic tableware, saw caviar, roast chicken, stewed lamb, Fried beef eye, fried keel fish, creamy soup and other foods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These foods are placed in front of several diners in a certain order and certain needs, among which there are slightly blessed Kapin and white wigs. The middle-aged gentleman Heras, Katie, who only wears a thin shirt, and the faceless old-fashioned Parker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While looking obliquely out from the tail of the dining table, you can find a decorative glass window, the window is sparse, and the red moon is faintly visible in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein opened his eyes and marked the position of the moon in the dream, and then calculated the approximate time according to the common sense of astrology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"7:30 to 45 points... Considering a few pictures, the card equalizer has already ate more than half, and can adjust it for another 15 minutes. At one point, 7:30 is a better choice..." Klein silently interprets the revelation of "dream divination." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not too rare to have dinner at 7:30, this is even the mainstream of the Kingdom of Lun, and even the North Continent, because many middle classes or based on environmental issues Or, considering the cheap rent, I live in the suburbs. I have to take a short-distance steam train to and from the city every day. When they return home, it is often after 7 pm, so 7:30 to 8:00 is normal. Dinner time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had such an experience in the city of Tingen, but it was because there were no servants, no full-time wife, three brothers and sisters returned home, still I have to be busy for a while before I can enjoy the hot food, not the distance to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why civilians and the poor often use dinner from 7:30 to 8:00. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And because lunch and dinner are too far apart, the afternoon tea that belongs to the upper class has gradually become popular among middle-class and civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the interpretation, Klein recalled the revelation he had just received, and keenly noticed a problem:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;card Where are the flat wives and children? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t appear in the restaurant... Is it that Kapin is the ultimate believer in the storm, and women and children have to go to the living room to eat? Or, is there another reason? Or, Kaping is still not married, and there are no children? He is a middle-aged man... Klein tried to divination, failed to get effective revelation, and had to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"7:30." He repeated this time point and immediately returned to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, even at home, the official bow tie Picking up his eyes and looking at the men in front of him, the speed of speech is slow but chillingly asks: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fabian is dead?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, boss." Even if he is a caddy of Kaping for many years, the man is also somewhat fearful and fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Odys, Mr. Mr., sir, after a few years, I have to call the jazz." Kapin pulled the bow tie and looked like a leisurely deal with the big one. Cigar, "When did Fabian die? How did he die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This afternoon, I asked him to go to the Eastern District to do something, and he and he The Mang party’s people were in conflict and were stabbed in the neck...” Odes described with trepidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The card is grilled with cigars, and the tone is nothing to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fabien is really a Idiot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, people at the Zimmergg party will not know that he is an idiot under my command?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr., you know, there are often highlanders to the Eastern District. Joining the Zmang party, they are brutal and reckless, and they don’t care who they are.” Odes quickly explained two sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaping snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They forgot that this is not a plateau? Or, forget I am Kapyeong?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Odys, I want the body of the Zmeng party leader in that block, can you get it? If you can't do it, I will sink your wife, child, and you together into the Tsock River. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, no problem! Odys immediately raised the volume.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he whispered again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Who can I mobilize? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaping was about to answer, the door was suddenly pushed open, and the middle-aged gentleman Heras wearing a white hair set came in.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at Odes in a cold, his eyes moved to Kapyeong:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that you have There was a conflict between the men in the Eastern District and the gang, and it was dead? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Mr. Heras. "Kapin took the cigar and stood up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herras stared at Kapyeong's eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to retaliate against them? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaping's forehead suddenly pulled out a drop of sweat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, Mr. Heras, you misunderstood. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heras nodded slightly: "You must remember that we are at a critical time, if not necessary, try not to cause trouble." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused for a second and observed the reaction of the next Kaping:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Baker Rand’s traffickers are not the only ones. We can support you and support others. You have to remember this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the beginning, you were chosen because you are sufficiently vicious enough to be shameless but cautious, not that you are already the biggest trafficker."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odds is listening to the two people talking next to each other, I can’t wait for myself to be just a group of air, so I can’t see the humble appearance of Ka Ping’s boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of the card is not irritated, accompanied by a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Heras, My main concern is that Fabian's death is not simple, which may upset your plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, there is no problem with his death." Heras said in a calm tone, "I didn't get any feedback."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way..." Kapin pretended to be relieved. "Then I will Don't worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at Odes, indicating that the other person went out, and then lowered the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Mr. Heras, this time there is a type of goods you like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Heras’s expression is loose but has not done anything, The card was busy and added another sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There has been sent to the side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Heras 遂 Slow dagger:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let her at night My room to "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" Yes, sir Hellas "capim smiles road!. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing Heras leave, his face became gloomy, took a breath, and whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that you can keep your promises this time... I don't want to participate in similar things anymore!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly remembers the harvest festival of that year, someone found He hopes to start a group of innocent girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that day on, his life trajectory has changed dramatically, and even ate one-fifth of the slave trade that was transferred to the ground due to legal bans. Share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly became a more famous rich man of Beckland, met many great people, and dragged them into the fallen abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, he is eager to cover up the sins of the past, and wants to "bapping" again to be baptized and become a true high society, however, for the time being Can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the cigar, Ka Ping picked up the photo frame on the table, and he had a photo with a beautiful woman and two children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thumb rubbed over the surface of the photo frame, and the card squinted and whispered to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After this time, you should be able to come back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At dinner, Kapin walked out of the study and his face was hung again with a sly smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Katie, have your favorite caviar tonight, and the grilled chicken specially prepared for you," he said to the lady in a thin shirt. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katie touched the old scar on his face, did not say a word, just nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaping knows that she is a silent and fierce personality, no jealousy, and she is given her to sit in the position that belongs to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Heras wearing a white hair set entered the restaurant, slightly beheading each diners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old-fashioned Parker drank a pre-meal wine and smiled and said that the card was sitting down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White napkins are spread out, the food is on the end, the card is flattened, and the tea is chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The storm is on, let us toast to a better future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheers for a better future," Parker responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heras did not speak, only pinched the high glass of the glass, and made a false mention, Katie completely ignored several people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the classical wall clock hanging in the hall just arrived at 7:23. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland Bridge area, a budget hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disguised Klein took out the gold-shelled pocket watch, looked at the specific time, and then took out the Holy Night powder and blocked the room with a spiritual wall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, he quickly arranged the altar and held the ceremony:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I call in my name:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Followers who are not in this era The mysterious ruler above the fog, the king of yellow and black who is in charge of good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; When the ceremony is completed, Klein immediately steps back four steps, into the fog, ready to respond to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the towering and solemn palace, he saw the "Summoning Gate" condensed by the twilight pattern, which is full of mysterious symbols. Unreal door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not in a hurry to be summoned, but in accordance with the planned plan, the magical items such as "sun brooch" are included in their own spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he picked up the "Black Emperor" card and let the spirit wrap it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, Klein felt that his body was as solid as flesh and blood, and seemed to be able to pick up the pistol and move the table and chair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
