			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark red round pen was placed, and Klein picked up the paper with the divination statement and leaned back against the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His lips twitched and whispered "Kaping's dinner today", over and over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words swayed over the silent, empty fog, and Klein's eyes quickly turned deep, and the eyes slowly hang down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a fragmented dream, he saw the spacious and elegant restaurant, saw the gold-plated ceramic tableware, saw caviar, roast chicken, stewed lamb, Fried beef eye, fried keel fish, creamy soup and other foods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These foods are placed in front of several diners in a certain order and certain needs, among which there are slightly blessed Kapin and white wigs. The middle-aged gentleman Heras, Katie, who only wears a thin shirt, and the faceless old-fashioned Parker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While looking obliquely out from the tail of the dining table, you can find a decorative glass window, the window is sparse, and the red moon is faintly visible in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein opened his eyes and marked the position of the moon in the dream, and then calculated the approximate time according to the common sense of astrology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"7:30 to 45 points... Considering a few pictures, the card equalizer has already ate more than half, and can adjust it for another 15 minutes. At one point, 7:30 is a better choice..." Klein silently interprets the revelation of "dream divination." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not too rare to have dinner at 7:30, this is even the mainstream of the Kingdom of Lun, and even the North Continent, because many middle classes or based on environmental issues Or, considering the cheap rent, I live in the suburbs. I have to take a short-distance steam train to and from the city every day. When they return home, it is often after 7 pm, so 7:30 to 8:00 is normal. Dinner time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had such an experience in the city of Tingen, but it was because there were no servants, no full-time wife, three brothers and sisters returned home, still I have to be busy for a while before I can enjoy the hot food, not the distance to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why civilians and the poor often use dinner from 7:30 to 8:00. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And because lunch and dinner are too far apart, the afternoon tea that belongs to the upper class has gradually become popular among middle-class and civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the interpretation, Klein recalled the revelation he had just received, and keenly noticed a problem:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;card Where are the flat wives and children? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t appear in the restaurant... Is it that Kapin is the ultimate believer in the storm, and women and children have to go to the living room to eat? Or, is there another reason? Or, Kaping is still not married, and there are no children? He is a middle-aged man... Klein tried to divination, failed to get effective revelation, and had to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"7:30." He repeated this time point and immediately returned to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, even at home, the official bow tie Picking up his eyes and looking at the men in front of him, the speed of speech is slow but chillingly asks: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fabian is dead?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, boss." Even if he is a caddy of Kaping for many years, the man is also somewhat fearful and fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Odys, Mr. Mr., sir, after a few years, I have to call the jazz." Kapin pulled the bow tie and looked like a leisurely deal with the big one. Cigar, "When did Fabian die? How did he die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This afternoon, I asked him to go to the Eastern District to do something, and he and he The Mang party’s people were in conflict and were stabbed in the neck...” Odes described with trepidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fabien is really an idiot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, the Zangger party will not know that he is my idiot? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr., you know, there are often people from the plateau who join the Zangger Party in the Eastern District. They are brutal and reckless, and they don’t care who they are. . Odyss explained two sentences quickly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaping snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They Forgot that this is not a plateau? Or, forget me me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Odys, I want the body of the leader of the Zmeng party in the block, can you do it? If you can't, I will take your wife. , child, together with you, sink into the Tsock River."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., no problem!" Odes immediately raised the volume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who can I mobilize?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaping was about to answer, the door was suddenly pushed open, and the middle-aged gentleman Heras wearing a white hair set came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at Odes in a cold, his eyes moving to Kapyeong:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I heard that you have a conflict with the gang in the Eastern District and you are dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Mr. Heras." Kapin holds a cigar , stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herras stared at Kapyeong’s eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to retaliate against them?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaping's forehead suddenly pulled out a drop of sweat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, He Mr. Russ, you misunderstood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heras nodded slightly: "You must remember that we are at a critical time, if not necessary, try not to cause trouble "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused for a second and observed the reaction of the next Kaping:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Beckland's traffickers are not the only ones. We can support you and support others. You have to remember this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the first place, It's because you are scarce enough to be shameless but cautious, not that you are already the biggest trafficker. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odys was listening to the conversation between the two, and I wished that I was just a group of air, so I couldn’t see the humbleness of Ka Ping’s boss.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of the card is not irritated, accompanied by a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Heras, I am mainly worried It is not easy to die by Fabian, which may upset your plan. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, there is no problem with his death." "Heras said in a calm tone, "I didn't get any feedback. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way..." Kapin pretended to be relieved. "Then I am relieved." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Odes, indicating that the other person went out, and then lowered the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Heras, this time there is a type of goods you like. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Heras’s expression was loose but did not make any representations, the card was busy and added another sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"There has been sent to the other side. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heras 遂 Slow dagger:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let her come to my room at night . ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Heras leave, his face became gloomy and took a breath, whispering: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that you can keep your promise this time...I I don't want to participate in similar things anymore!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly remembers the harvest festival of that year, someone found him, hoping to start a group of innocent girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that day on, his life trajectory has changed dramatically, and even ate one-fifth of the slave trade that was transferred to the ground due to legal bans. Share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly became a more famous rich man of Beckland, met many great people, and dragged them into the fallen abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, he is eager to cover up the sins of the past, and wants to "bapping" again to be baptized and become a true high society, however, for the time being Can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the cigar, Ka Ping picked up the photo frame on the table, and he had a photo with a beautiful woman and two children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thumb rubbed over the surface of the photo frame, and the card squinted and whispered to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After this time, you should be able to come back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At dinner, Kapin walked out of the study and his face was hung again with a sly smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Katie, have your favorite caviar tonight, and the grilled chicken specially prepared for you," he said to the lady in a thin shirt. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katie touched the old scar on his face, did not say a word, just nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaping knows that she is a silent and fierce personality, no jealousy, and she is given her to sit in the position that belongs to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Heras wearing a white hair set entered the restaurant, slightly beheading each diners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old-fashioned Parker drank a pre-meal wine and smiled and said that the card was sitting down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White napkins are spread out, the food is on the end, the card is flattened, and the tea is chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The storm is on, let us toast to a better future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheers for a better future," Parker responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heras did not speak, only pinched the high glass of the glass, and made a false mention, Katie completely ignored several people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the classical wall clock hanging in the hall just arrived at 7:23. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland Bridge area, a budget hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disguised Klein took out the gold-shelled pocket watch, looked at the specific time, and then took out the Holy Night powder and blocked the room with a spiritual wall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, he quickly arranged the altar and held the ceremony:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I call in my name:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Followers who are not in this era The mysterious ruler above the fog, the king of yellow and black who is in charge of good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; When the ceremony is completed, Klein immediately steps back four steps, into the fog, ready to respond to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the towering and solemn palace, he saw the "Summoning Gate" condensed by the twilight pattern, which is full of mysterious symbols. Unreal door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
