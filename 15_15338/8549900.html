			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t think about that damn bill, let’s discuss ritual magic.” Old Neil easily took items such as candles, cauldrons and silver knives. Start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wants to spend the rest of his life as a foreigner shrugs his shoulders, but in the end he still didn’t do this gentleman’s action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his attention back to the ritual magic itself, throwing out the details of the previous doubts and getting a sure answer, for example, The mantra of the mind has a certain format. As long as it is satisfied and the key meaning is expressed in the Hermes language, the other parts can be played freely. Of course, the awkward and less respectful description is absolutely forbidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "mystery course" lasted until noon, and the old Neil coughed two channels:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "We must return to Zouteland Street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, he complained vaguely:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to receive those damn materials, I missed the lovely breakfast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked around with a funny and puzzled look Look: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Neil, do you have a chef at home? Or the maid who is responsible for cooking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;12 pounds per week is enough to cover several servants! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the newspaper, in the case of accommodation and food, please ask an ordinary chef to only need 12 to 15 weeks of weekly salary, even 1 pound is not used, chores The maid is cheaper, and the weekly salary is only 3 Sule 6 pence to 6 Sule. Of course, I can't count on their cooking skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃, it’s not right, Mr. Neil still owes 30 pounds of foreign debt, and does not ask chefs and servants to be normal...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seem to ask questions that I shouldn’t ask...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein regrets, Old Neil is not at all Mind the head: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I often try ritual magic at home, study extraordinary items and corresponding literature, and will not and cannot ask ordinary people to be chefs, servants And the maid, just regular people come to clean, and if it is not ordinary people, do you think they will be willing to do similar work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I seem to ask A stupid question, maybe because I don't do anything that involves mystery at home." Klein explained with a mockery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil stood up early, put on a round felt hat, and walked outside the door, muttering:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I seem to smell the smell of fried foie gras...and the bills are completely solved, I must have a good one! I will definitely be able to eat a whole piece of roast pork with apple sauce at noon. No, this is not enough. You must have another sausage with mashed potatoes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am hungry... Klein swallowed, fast Follow the old Neil and head to the nearby public carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Zouteland Street, Old Neil just stepped off the carriage and suddenly "Hmm":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What did I see? Goddess, what did I see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly and agilely like a 17-year-old boy, flying To the side of the road, picked up the same thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wonders to move closer and take a closer look and find that it is a work-skinned wallet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to tell whether his dark brown wallet is cowhide or sheepskin with his eyes and insights, only to notice that a light blue small coat of arms is embroidered on it. Above the coat of arms is a white dove that spreads its wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first impression that Klein got, and from the second eye, he was stuck by the banknotes that bulged the wallet. Sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil unfolded the wallet, pulled out the banknotes, and carefully licked it, and immediately snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"10 pounds of paper money, a respectable 'founder ''Protector' William I, oh, goddess, a full 30, and a few 5, 1, and 5 Sule notes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than three hundred pounds? This is a huge sum in the true sense! I may not have so much money for ten years... Klein’s breathing is involuntarily heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the value of the Golden Pound is very high, when you get to such a wallet, you will get the same as a suitcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know which gentleman is falling...will definitely not be an ordinary person." Klein calmly analyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wallet is obviously not a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't care who he is." Old Neil chuckled. "We won't try to take possession of these money that doesn't belong to us. Let's wait here. Well, I think that gentleman will come back soon and look for it. For anyone, this is not something that is easy to give up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is loose The tone has a new understanding of the moral qualities of the old Neil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was quite worried about the other party’s excuse to use the goddess to pay back the bill, thinking hard about how to stop it, how to persuade . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is "do whatever you want, but don't hurt"? Klein suddenly had a little insight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two waited for less than a minute on the street and saw a luxurious four-wheeled carriage flying fast, the light blue coat on the side was on the side It is a white dove with wings open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage stopped, a middle-aged man in a black suit and a bow tie with the same color left the carriage and looked at the wallet and took off the hat ceremony:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two gentlemen, this should be my master's wallet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your coat of arms proves Everything, but I still need to verify it again. This is responsible for everyone. How much money is there in the wallet?” Old Neil responded politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man snorted and immediately laughed at himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a The housekeeper should not know how much money is left in the owner's wallet. Sorry, please allow me to ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is your freedom." Neil made a gesture of asking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man returned to the carriage and passed through the window to communicate with the people inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is back near Klein and Old Neal, and smiles and says:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than 300 pounds Less than 350 pounds, my master doesn't remember the exact amount."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't remember...I am really a big dog, I have to have so much money, Certainly counted over and over again... Klein is full of envy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil nodded and handed the wallet back:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goddess proved, This is yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man took the wallet, probably counted it again, and then pulled out three 10 pound notes from it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My master is Sir Deville. He said that your quality is appreciated by him. This is the reward that honest people should receive. Please do not refuse."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deville Sir? Sir Deville, who founded the "Deville Trust Company" to provide low-cost rental housing for the underlying workers? Klein remembered the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the jazz that his brother, Banson, respects and believes that things are not close enough to reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the carriage of Sir Deville's carriage, he saw no one around, and turned to look at Klein, squinting at the banknotes and laughing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "30 pounds, the bill is settled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that it will be resolved in a reasonable manner."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the power of magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The power of GodTM magic! This is also OK! Klein was stunned again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, he entered the stairs and climbed to the security company. He asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Mr. Neil, why don't you pray for more money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not be greedy, especially when holding ritual magic, temperance is every glimpse The key element that the secret person lived long enough.” Old Neil explained with ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the huge ballroom, several chandeliers are erected The burning candles, which exude a pleasant aroma, accumulate the light that is not inferior to the gas lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long strip of table topped with fried foie gras, grilled steak, grilled chicken, fried squid, Desi oyster, stewed lamb, creamy Delicious food such as soup, in addition to a bottle of misty champagne, Ormill wine and Nanwei red wine, they exude a seductive color under the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A servant in a red vest holds a plate of crystal cups and shuttles between dressed up or elegant or gorgeous gentlemen and ladies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey Hall is wearing a pale white dress with a collar, high waist and lambskin sleeves. The upper body is tightly tied and the waist is very thin. The layered cake cut is perfectly propped up by the whale hoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her long blond hair is elegant, the earrings, necklaces and rings are shining brightly, and at the foot is a pair of white dances with roses and diamonds. shoe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are 4, 5, or 6 petticoats inside?" Audrey touched the skirt with her right hand wearing white gauze gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her left hand is holding a glass of sparkling champagne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey is not in the center of the banquet as in the past, becoming the focus of everyone, but avoiding the excitement and standing quietly on the floor-to-ceiling window In the shadow of the curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sipped her champagne and looked at the people in front of her with a gesture that did not belong here:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The younger son of Earl Wolfe is chatting with the daughter of Viscount Conrad. He likes to use a wielding arm to strengthen his tone. Well, the more he swings, the less credible the content is. This is a validated conclusion... He can't help but raise himself and belittle others, but it is difficult to control guilty conscience, which will be expressed in the way he speaks, the language of the body...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Laura covers her laughter with her left hand again and again today, um, I know, she is showing off the pure aquamarine on her left hand...<br /><br />&nbsp ;; her husband, the Duke of Nigan, talked about the situation with a few conservative aristocrats not far away, from the beginning of the banquet to the present, he only actively looked for his Lady Laura once... Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have almost no real eye contact...maybe, um, they are not like a watch It’s so loving...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Panis was laughed seven times by Baron Larry, which is normal, not surprising, but why she wants to use her guilty eyes Looking to her husband... Hey, they are separated... No, they go to the garden where they go...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this extravagant banquet, Audrey saw many details that would never be noticed at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, she almost really believed that she was watching a play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
