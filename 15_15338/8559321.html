			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After recognizing who the leader on the mural was, Klein subconsciously suspected that this was the content of his dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he quickly denied the idea, because the unlucky Anderson is not anyone he knows, nor who is the one who has ever encountered Who, the big probability does not belong to the extension of his dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Anderson clearly stated that he was unlucky because he saw the mural and was strongly associated with the mural, so this is part of his dream. Correct! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astringing spirit, look carefully, Klein quickly discovered that the frescoes here and the small "sun" in the "real creator" abandoned temples have several murals The difference: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The background here is the sea burning with golden flames, the former is the desert of ridiculous silence;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The destination here is the depths of the sea, the former is the distant mountain, the top of the mountain has a huge cross and the person hanging upside down;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The "destination angel" here is the black mud and the fish that is inserted into the head down. The former is the river that circulates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the same mural, closer to the record of the different stages of a pilgrimage journey... Klein had a guess at the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene has emerged in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time ago, at the fourth At some point in the period, the "swallower" Uluoss led the devout pilgrim team or the remaining "real creator" believers, and in the pursuit of many powerful enemies, rushed to the sea by boat;<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason, He gave up the ship and relied on the help of the "real Creator" or his own power to directly separate the sea and lead the devout to pass through here and enter the "God" "Abandoned land", retaining the fires of organizations such as "Redemption Rose" and "Aurora"; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Abandoned Land", they pass through the deserted plains On the way of "pilgrimage", a temple was built, which was later discovered by the little "sun". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the "Silver of the Mercy" Will Unsetin was forced to restart the cycle, reversing into the embryo, "swallower" should still be alive... Does it mean that he led the “pilgrims” who finally arrived at the destination – the sanctuary of the “real creator”? Does this mean that the sanctuary of the “real creator” is somewhere in the “land of gods”? Thinking of this, Klein suddenly emerged some inexplicable feelings:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my guess is correct, it means that no matter how "the city of silver" saves itself, how According to the passing of fire, when the "real creator" wakes up completely or returns to normal, they will inevitably go to ruin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are close to the godland and the sanctuary of the evil spirit, your existence is irrelevant to your own efforts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a bubble that ignites between the seas, and when the wave passes, it will disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human race, the human civilization, under the watchful eyes of the evil spirits, is such a fragility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, can't be so pessimistic, I just guessed that maybe it wouldn't be Urlois that the life science dean of Will Anthony was reincarnation. Perhaps the 'real creator' is not so easy to recover or wake up, he may be bearing the seal of the Seven Gods...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, Silver City has a chance, Grab the road of the "Abandoned Land" and the outside world before the evil spirits break free from the bondage, and move out! This is probably the reason why Silver City’s chief wants to release the 'Shepherd' elders. They must use the power that every point can use...” Klein forcibly withdrew his thoughts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He immediately worried that he was already in the "fate cycle" made by the "swallower".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, he instinctively I want to go back four steps, get into the fog, and forcibly retrieve the memory that may have been eliminated, but in the end, he still clings to this impulse, ready to observe and observe:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of interpreting symbolism, there is no circulating river here, only the black mud with fish in it, representing the cycle of no fate, only the entanglement of doom!<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in line with Anderson's words! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the king of angels, Uluos is certainly not going to have a trick of 'fate cycle'. Different murals of different temples are completely logical with different abilities. ... again, this is a dream!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, even if I didn't do anything, and really fell into a loop, I kept repeating with the 'star above 'Dialogue to the experience of observing observation, until next Monday, the problem can be solved. At that time, Tarot will definitely not be able to hold it as scheduled. Miss 'Justice' will inevitably make prayers, and I will Can use this to retrieve memories..." Klein had a sigh of relief, and the panic and tightness in his heart did not disappear, or he was deeply hidden inside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked up and looked forward, and found that the hall was deep, and he could not see the end at a glance, and the light shining outside the door was limited to coming in. This place was quite dark, and the darker the darker, only I can see that there are a wooden door on both sides, I don’t know where to go.<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this dark and dark scene, Klein’s desire to continue exploring has dropped to a minimum:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The murals left by the king of angels, who knows to go deeper and enter other rooms, what will happen..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear of the unknown is an extremely ancient The emotions can be foreseen to be dangerous but I don’t know what the danger is from, but the unknown that can bring the strongest fear. Klein self-examined for a few seconds and stopped moving forward.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to Anderson on the axe with the giant wood:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you here? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson looked up at him and snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a treasure hunter . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say I am here to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treasure hunter...Klein asked casually道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have a treasure here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson continues to bury his head in making so-called canoes, voices It becomes low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sea area is full of treasures.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you can Successfully got it and went out alive. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also...the problem is that it is not a demigod, it will be dangerous here, and the demigod is more dangerous here... Klein looks out Deep in the hall:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know what's there? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson followed his gaze: [br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have at least one-third of my companions to form a team, to explore there, and then never come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean the real world, or the dream?" Klein asked thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andyson smiled after the axe fell:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is the real world.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the dream, I explored another third of my companions, and they did not return. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein took a breath and thought: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their real world What about the body? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mutation became a monster, killing a lot of companions. Anderson picked up the axe and forced it to the next one.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear sound His axe was broken two pieces, because the rupture was at the back, and the shards slammed onto him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson's right chest and abdomen suddenly flowed out of bright red blood, like a spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed a wound with his left hand, lifted his head, looked at Klein, and smiled bitterly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I said, after seeing the mural, I have been shrouded in bad luck.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Fortunately, this is not too bad, at least they Did not ruin my ordinary handsome face. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... How are these two adjectives put together? Klein watched Anderson quickly take out the debris, heal the wound, take the medicine, and find that he is emotionally stable Skilled, it seems to be used to it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein single-handedly put a pocket, playing with the coins inside, and asked: <br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When your companion explores, are you and the rest part left to study murals in situ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson snorted and pulled the pharmacy bag back into his belt and wiped his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Do not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I belong to the third of the previous explorations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking The corner of his mouth opened a little, revealing a sly smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... Klein’s pupil squashed, directly on the back of the micro-bow, raised the left palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the glare of the sun shines, everything is white, then fades, disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein naturally opened his eyes and found that it was back to noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the gold-shelled pocket watch and glanced at it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only half past Hours, this night is a bit short...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The unlucky Anderson just looked normal, I didn't expect it to be so scary! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After turning out of bed, Klein suddenly remembered one thing, that is, "The Snake of Destiny" Will Ansett has not yet "returned" !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because everyone’s dreams are drawn into the world, not connected to the spiritual world, so he cannot locate? Or, he perceives the “swallower” "The breath of Ulouse, did not dare to approach? Or, this sea itself has problems? Kane decided to verify the thoughts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how to verify The method is very simple, that is, holding "noon" and going back to sleep again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he is not in a hurry to do this because he does not know if there is daytime here. Taboos that can't sleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a cap, Klein came outside the captain and slammed the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three screams, he took back his hand and waited patiently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, "Star above" Jia Delia opened The door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no confusion in her face, and she re-established heavy glasses.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you sleep during the day? Klein asked straightforwardly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddria nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After answering, she hesitated the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the dream, you seem to Very actionable? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of the dangers hidden in this sea area, and think of what might be forced to show something afterwards. Klein decided to take the initiative to lay the ground.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Jia Delia and smiled politely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
