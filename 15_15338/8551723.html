			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday morning, Klein, who has finished the occultal course, did not find a quiet place to look at the "Ancient and Modern Names" and "Night of the Night" "Inside the internal information, but stay in the entertainment room, and play with Leonard, Cohenri, and Luo Yao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just let Mr. Azick create an opportunity to bring out the seal "3 - 0782"... Can you seize this opportunity and have to look at me? His own on-the-spot play... Klein’s mind was completely out of the table, so that he lost his hand and lost 5 Sule in an hour. He lost his heart and tried to concentrate on it and save some losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- After purchasing various materials of "Yangyan Charms" yesterday afternoon, his private money dropped to less than 1 pound, and this still has to pay for every day. 2 Soule's rental carriage costs to check houses with dark red chimneys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When waiting for Cohen to reshuffle, he boringly picked up the copper penny in front of him and made a spin at random. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw Luo Yao staring at himself and staring very seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's wrong? Klein first saw it, and immediately saw the crumbling copper penny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Is this a warning to me cheating in divination? Playing the cards between the teammates, don't be so serious... He instantly understood, and smiled and pressed the 1 penny coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Dunn Smith knocked on the door and looked around:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are some conditions in the town of Morse, Leonard, you have to deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morse Town? Klein's spirit was aroused, and he curiously asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun ash swept away and explained: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In recent days, there have been several suspected haunted incidents there, first someone While passing by the cemetery, I heard a cry inside and saw a vague shadow flashing. Then, a widow woke up to the bathroom in the middle of the night and met her dead husband, almost fainting, and The old man living alone always hears heavy footsteps in the house, but as long as he lights the candle or the gas lamp, everything is quiet. The residents of this town generally believe in the goddess, and the local priests directly informed the situation. Come up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No injury, closer to prank...It should be made by Mr. Azick...Klein used repeated expressions and tone Road: "Captain, suddenly there are several suspected haunted things, maybe hidden behind Secret, in this respect, divination can give some revelation, I think I can help Leonard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heard this sentence, Leonard Green The eyes immediately stared at Klein and seemed to want to find clues and traces from the other's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn was first beheaded and then hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw the reaction of the captain and immediately added another sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"something In the end, perhaps ritual magic is needed to thoroughly purify."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It makes sense." Dunn thought about it. "Then you go with Leonard." Township."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under others, he added: "Well, your afternoon fighting practice should not be able to catch up, I will find someone." Go to inform Gao Wen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, the first step is completed... Klein secretly vomited and quickly picked up Sule and Penny in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In half, his movements suddenly froze, looking sideways at Dunn, solemnly speaking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, I think we must prevent the worst situation. If there is a strong resentment behind the haunted incident, it will be very dangerous for me and Leonard alone, and the city of Tingen will be very dangerous. Township, get two, amount, three hours? Even if we took the telegram for help in time, we have to persist for a long time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" So? Dunn interrupted his description. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope to get help from a teammate." Klein pretended to be thinking. "And, according to the regulations, three or more nights can act together to apply for the '3' seal, um, '3 —0782' is best suited to solve this problem.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, Leonard next to it laughed:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really your style, cautious, careful, never risky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You seem to say that I am... I am looking directly at the "eternal yang"! Klein pretended not to hear Leonard's words and sincerely looked at Dunn Smith: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, what is your opinion?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is really a chance to prevent accidents. There have been too many recent coincidences..." Dunn looked as if thinking, and looked at the other two players. "Coenley You go to the town of Morse with Leonard and Klein. You can quickly apply for an application. After I sign it, I will take out the seal '3—0782' after the door of Chanis.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Cohen Li, who is not tall, put down the cards in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay! Klein cheered in his heart, but the surface was awkward, cautious and dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Sieke Thorn is monitoring Hood Eugen of the Madhouse, and Frye is worthy of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the entertainment room, Klein put on a black tuxedo, took a hat and a cane, and with Leonard, waited for Cohenri on the stairs leading to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody, quiet and quiet, Leonard suddenly looked sideways at Klein Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I think you'd better give up the unrealistic fantasies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...what?" Klein responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard stepped forward and stood on the edge of the ladder, overlooking the deeper road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Even in the mission, you can't discover my secrets and understand my special place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Classmates, don't be so narcissistic, okay? ... Originally, you thought that I took the initiative to apply for this task, in order to secretly observe you? I didn't even think about this in mind! Klein first stunned and then snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you know that my speciality can't help me discover your secret?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard’s expression was a little dignified, but he immediately smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is it? Then I am waiting for you. The discovery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I collect more information and items, I will go over the fog and help you to do a divination, thank you! Klein responded to each other with his belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the short and sturdy Cohenli appeared on the embarrassing ladder with the "variation of the sun's emblem". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the unique warmth and purity, Klein quietly sighed and knew that he had finally completed his plan to steal the power of "Eternal Vigor" It was also the most difficult step at first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, a group of three left Blackthorn Security Company, came to Zouteland Street, and went to the carriage belonging to the night team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The effect of purification will not affect the horses?" Cohenli suddenly asked a little nervously, "I don't want to just praise the sun." 'The horse-drawn carriage...'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The years he became a night lover are only longer than Klein, and the experience is far from rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the seal '3 - 0782' only purifies creatures with higher intelligence." Klein replied with a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is not the case, I will not be bitten by mosquitoes... He added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out to be like this... Oh, I didn't see enough information when I saw it." Cohenli pressed his black top hat and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
