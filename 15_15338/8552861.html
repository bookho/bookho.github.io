			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is a dream divination, but Klein saw more scenes this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first act is still the small, dark, dirty room and Ian Wright sleeping on the high and low beds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second act is the sewer that the two have been to at the same time. Ian squats in front of the incomplete body of Zerrell and reaches for the two rows of white. Sensen's teeth, took one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third act is a lively and noisy street, where passers-by are plain, even obsolete or tattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are gardens and lawns in the street, surrounded by low-pitched chimneys, and Ian, who wears an old coat and a dome hat, looks out and enters the street. Far from the telegraph office, diagonally opposite the mall-like steam subway entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture fades quickly until it is transparent, Klein opens his eyes, and the index finger slowly taps the edge of the bronze long table, making a preliminary judgment:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From that tooth and telegraph, Zerrell and Ian are not a detective combination that is accidentally involved in a dangerous incident, there is an organization behind them!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be possible to determine where the third scene corresponds..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not in a hurry to analyze it because He didn't want to stay on the fog for too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the high chair that belongs to the "fool", he came to the side corner and found the Messo from the paper bag that was sent here before. The extraordinary characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the jelly-like crimson item, Klein sat down again and wrote a new divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The corresponding potion name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent thought, he held the extraordinary character of the group with one hand and the divination statement in one hand. Paper, with meditation, entered a deep sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray and psychedelic dreams, the ambassador who was gorgeous and exaggerated, and his face was thin and scum, appeared again in Kline’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a bottle of deep red liquid to the Mersor Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drink It, drink this bottle of 'hunter' potion, you can dominate the Zimmergg party, of course, money is also indispensable, Russell the Great once said, a big stick, a hand carrot."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunter? Beckland is a metropolis..." Mersor frowned, questioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his illiterate cognition, hunters belong to the wild and belong to animals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged ambassador laughed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The biggest city, the biggest darkness Jungle.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Here, everyone has two identities, one is prey and the other is a hunter.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The weaker hunter is also a hunter, and may also hurt powerful prey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, join this grand hunting game." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture is broken, turned into countless light and shadow, Klein looks down The dark red extraordinary character in the hand, silently said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out to be a 'hunter' potion, no wonder Mersor can play, but also use The quenching blows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder he can recourse to me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "However, he does not seem to really understand the essence of the hunter, no preset traps, no use I didn’t play the corresponding specialties... This is because he doesn’t know that I am also an extraordinary person, and it’s still the extraordinary person of Sequence 8, which is despised. On the other hand, it also shows that he took the potion and soon...”< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what the important item he wants to get..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking in the rolling room, Klein wrapped himself with spirituality and fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just returned to the room, he immediately looked around with vigilance and found no abnormal changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coke, Klein breathed a sigh of relief, and he had more confidence in convening the Tarot members on time tomorrow afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to find the map of Beckland on the steam train, looking for the telegraph office along the subway, the telegraph office not far from the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland is currently on several subway lines, and Klein quickly identified three targets, one in the West End, one in the St. George District, and one in The intersection of the Eastern District and the Beckland Bridge area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recalled the dressing and class positioning of most pedestrians in the dream, and got the final answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The third place! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intersection of the Eastern District and the Beckland Bridge area! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, interpreting revelation also requires a wealth of real-world knowledge and corresponding reasoning skills... Klein laughs at himself and comes to the desk, the one he wrote before. After the paragraph statement, a sentence was added to make the content on the paper more abundant:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know the whereabouts of Ian Wright, discovering Zerrell After the body, I never saw him again. However, I learned through my own channel that Ian Wright appeared in the telegraph office on White Rum Street."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After writing, Klein did not fold and put up the paper, nor did he ignite it with spirituality, but let it spread out on the desk and show his own content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deep gaze, Klein returned to the bed, undressing and sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the closed curtains, the red moon has a layer of clouds, shining and chasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilston District, in a house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falth, who was sleeping separately from Hugh, suddenly sat up, stretched out his hands and grabbed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her pretty face has been twisted to the extreme, like a demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falth holding down the ears on both sides, constantly rolling on the bed, seems to be against the illusory proverb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a drop of sweat on her forehead, and her hand was covered with a blue vein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her body is sometimes taut, sometimes rolling, and the pale blue eyes that have a playful and lazy taste are full of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the pupil, there seem to be countless light and shadow changes in the stack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!" Fols finally couldn't stand it and gave a low scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hands no longer cover her ears, but instead grab the hair and seem to fight the pain with pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body wriggles for a few minutes, and Firth finally stops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She loosened her hands and saw the handful of micro-volume brown hair, faintly laughing and laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I deceived Hugh, I told her that every full moon slang has no bad influence on me... At least hair loss is a very serious problem..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls struggled to sit up and looked at the curtain covering the window halfway through the gap and saw the dreamy red moon outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s more serious than once, and the next time it will be out of control...” Fols whispered, and could no longer restrain the deep burial in his heart. weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried to take a tranquilizer, tried to mourn the name of the god of steam and machinery, tried some ritual magic, but failed to change the status quo she gradually slipped into the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can understand what the proverb is saying... I want to die clearly, not buried in confusion... maybe, maybe, promotion After sequence 8, I will hear more clearly? However, I have never met someone who sells the 'Master of Tricks' formula." Fols looked out of the window and his eyes were stained with red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday morning, Klein, who was not sleeping well, woke up early Turn over and get out of bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the desk position, ready to pull the curtain, open the window, let the light and the outside wind come in at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the corner of his eyes swept the paper spread out on the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is facing the window and still stays the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Klein clearly remembers that before going to bed last night, the paper was facing the chair and facing the bed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After just a moment, it reversed and changed direction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's pupil tightened, violently stretched out the curtain, and saw that the convex window was still closed, and did not put a hurricane into it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the wind, the paper turned itself half a circle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, someone came in, in case I didn't notice it! Klein only felt a coolness flowing down his head to his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He in his sleep, nothing to do with this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that he was almost killed at the time, life and death only depend on the mood and thoughts of the other party! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member of the special department of the military, or a powerful person sent by the ambassador? From the paper is not restored to the original, to keep upside down, it is more likely to be the latter, indicating a certain warning ... can so sneak into this silent, very powerful ... I should not thank him for his kindness? No, why not do things that are easy to do, there must be inevitable reasons... Don’t want to be alarmed to monitor the military special members around you? Klein's thoughts were surging, and it was hard to contain a lot of thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote those words last night, letting the paper spread out on the desk, so that people can see, let the big mess to what he wants to know, let The revenge was postponed until the end of the matter, allowing him to obtain more lenient preparation time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Klein originally expected that the other party should go out and go out, and the special department of the military will sneak into the monitoring of the house, who knows, He was able to bypass the extraordinary people around him and quietly enter the bedroom while still sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling that life and death are mastered by others is very uncomfortable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very powerful, or extraordinary person with extraordinary ability..." Klein turned his body, his back to the belly window, and pulled out a 1p. copper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone sneaked into this room last night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He meditation statement, with the cover of the body, popped up the coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coin rolled and jumped, not falling over Klein’s shoulder and falling down on his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the number is facing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means negation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that no one sneaked into Klein’s bedroom last night! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paper will not turn for no reason...do I sleepwalking? No, I can stay awake even for the captain's invasion of the dream... Kline suddenly frowned and thought of two possibilities:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
