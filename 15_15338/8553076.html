			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clear figure in the mirror, but I don’t see the woman wearing the black court dress, she never seems to have appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quietly turned on the vision, but found nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I won’t ask a female ghost to be a bodyguard? This is even more strange than a female ghost... At least the vision can see the ghost... Klein thoughtfully touched the Azick copper whistle in the pocket of his pocket, only feeling cool and cold, no additional changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unaffected by the copper whistle...It’s not a dead spirit...but it’s not certain that the copper whistle followed me to be buried, but around The dead of the circle did not appear abnormal... Because the burial in the cemetery has been subjected to the resurrection of the pastor and the bishop? When does it work and when does it work? When the ambassador’s work is over, if I am still alive, I will go to the cemetery to do the experiment, trying to figure out the scope and limitations, not always with a time bomb... Klein washed his face and turned and walked out of the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just took the newspaper in the living room, ready to go to the living room or bedroom to look up, suddenly heard the doorbell was ringing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the sound of Dangdang, Klein suddenly tightened his spirits and put on a coat with various materials and walked toward the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly remembers that there will be dangers in recent days! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After standing at the door, waiting for a moment, Klein’s mind naturally emerged from the outside scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky red moon is looming, the elegant gas street lights on both sides of the street illuminate the wet road, the boy in the old coat stands there, the red eyes are deep With a little confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian Wright? How did he appear? Isn't this the picture I saw in my dream divination? Is this a precursor to a dangerous strike? Klein opened the door and vigilantly stepped back two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Detective Moriarty." Ian took off the brown dome and owed the body. "I came to say sorry to you, very Sorry, you are involved in such a dangerous incident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein frowned slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What you should do most is to go to the police station."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian looks around and bury his head:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just came out of MI9."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? Is this the name of the special department of the military? Klein let the road open and point to the living room:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe we can have a chat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have to know at least because I have fallen into such a passive situation... He sighed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian was not polite, followed Klein into the living room and sat in the last position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was about to speak, and Klein suddenly added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to say something It will make me into a bigger crisis, so I don't have to talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, everything is coming to an end." Ian has an age-independent Calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein breathed a sigh of relief and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, what happened? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice did not fall, suddenly saw a figure on the convex window glass opposite the living room: black court dress, pale gold ties, long hair, The eyes were blue, the appearance was exquisite, and the face was pale. It was the woman who had greeted Klein in the wash mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman seems to have found an unreal high-backed chair, with her left palm on her right elbow, her right hand on her cheek, and a look that has no expression. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Ian whispered for a few seconds, saying: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, Detective Zerrell is a spy of the Fossac Empire. He adopted several The wandering children, teach them the skills to collect intelligence, including me here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out to be like this... I was involved in a spy case... Klein was in awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian looks at the coffee table and continues:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have an age advantage, often I was able to collect a lot of useful information without being watched by others. Two weeks ago, I stumbled upon the clues of Hermosius’ manuscript.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Mo Xiuin?” Klein felt that the surname was familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian looked up and looked at him and explained:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Turani.von Hermosyn, the greatest scientist after the Great Russell, mathematician, mechanic, the father of the second generation of differential machines."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's him! Kleinton remembered the relevant introduction:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not only a great scientist, but also a crazy scientist. He believes that human beings have inherent defects and can only rely on The machine came to get the final truth. He loves to eat sugar. It seems to use this as his own source of energy. When he studied the third generation of differential machines, he was mysteriously missing. It is an important figure that countries are trying to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His manuscript? A manuscript involving a third-generation difference machine?" Klein tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Differential machine is a kind of mechanical device used for calculation, which can effectively improve the efficiency of scientific research and various projects. In Klein's view, this is the steam age. The alternative computer, of course, currently only has computing power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I didn't actually see it, maybe There are some related ideas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and talked about the incident again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I reported this to the detective of Zellel. He was very happy. Let me follow the lead and investigate it. He immediately reports to his boss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I spent some time and finally determined the whereabouts of the manuscript, but I was afraid of danger, did not go directly to steal, decided to return to the detective of Zaire, after that, I told you about it, Zerry The detective’s home was sneaked in, many small institutions did not recover, and he did not respond to my contact request. The Zhem’s party tried to catch me...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"With your help, I confirmed the death of Jeriel Detective and took a denture from his body, um, after our separation."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The detective Zerrell told me that the inside of the denture was engraved with the way to contact his boss urgently, even in a way that he did not know, only accidents would be taken." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gently sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you took the telegram in the past?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian’s rare flashes of sorrow:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is the military officer telling you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, a friend of mine just happened to see you on White Rum Street." Klein made a casual excuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Ian nodded in dismay. "I passed the telegram and contacted the detective of Zellel in Beckland's boss and agreed with the ciphertext. The time, place and manner of meeting, but soon, I was found by the Zimmerg party, no, precisely, the intelligence personnel of Intis, this is the person of the military intelligence department told me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, the people in the MI9 arrived in time, and the two sides fell into a scuffle, and I took the opportunity to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, you are like a big boy of fifteen or six years old... Klein had just sentiment and suddenly thought of a problem from Ian’s words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Before I found that Zeil’s body still had something that seemed to be important, and when Ian was taken away, he just thought that the opposite person was not high, and the strength was not good. The effect of “Psychic” Not good, I can't get a lot of useful information, so I get a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after confirming that the ambassador has a middle-sequence of the "divination" approach, this thing becomes very strange, a powerful "psychic" "Under the denture, it is impossible to find it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the corpse is lost in such a remote and difficult place to find, nor is it a preset trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recombined with Ian’s description, the answer is ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein clicked on the head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Have you ever thought about Zerrell? There are traitors around the boss, who have turned to the betrayer of the Intis intelligence agency?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is why Zeerel was exposed and died after getting the manuscript clues. It is also the reason why you are ambushed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Ambassador Intis has mastered the situation of the boss of Zaire, the emergency inscribed on the inside of the denture Contact is not very concerned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zherel’s report to the boss directly led to his accident! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian listened for a moment, and for a long time, he clenched his fists in annoyance and tried to keep calm and said:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't even think about this, you are really a good detective..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quietly vomited and said :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also told the whereabouts of the manuscript to the military intelligence, and everything else, they rushed to mention your experience, oh, they turned out to be I didn't doubt that I lied, didn't send someone to look after me, all went to snatch the manuscript, but under that pressure, no one can lie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, Ian stood up and said deeply:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please allow me to say sorry again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, let you get involved in this kind of thing, in fact, you don't have to hide anything for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understand the reason Ryan smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, this is mainly because I made a mistake and fell into the current situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He just listened to it and, based on Ian’s description and reflections over the past few days, repeated the whole thing and confirmed that he had made two mistakes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ian found that the water was a bit deep, but I still had to entrust it. There was no problem. At that time, I only felt that it would involve gangsters. At most, there were at least one extraordinary person who could not be exposed in the shadows. However, divination lacked enough information and the result was Failure... This is, in the scope that it can solve, normally, there will be no trouble, and maybe it will take the opportunity to contact the extraordinary people of Beckland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Find Zerrell's body, make sure that the water is very deep, consider its own identity sensitive, immediately decisively withdraw, let Ian handle the follow-up, which is no problem, quite cautious choice."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of the mistakes I made was that Mersor was not decisive when he came to the door. Hey, shaking out the things related to Ian, but at the time I only thought that the opposite was a gangster. It was a few extraordinary people behind the gang. Who knows that this kind of character will be involved with Ambassador Intis, but what I didn’t expect is that Mersor is so Hey, after the task was not completed, he did not threaten and intimidate. He did not go through other processes. He went directly to kill and psychic. He did not give me the opportunity to repent. My situation deteriorated. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, this is not a too subjectively serious mistake. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A mistake that really led me to be so passive, was a small mistake at the beginning, renting and accepting commissions in the name of Sherlock Moratti At the time, did not do camouflage! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
