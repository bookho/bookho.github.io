			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, Klein, who had just returned from St. Saul’s Church, was preparing to enter the restaurant on the second floor, and saw the steward Walter welcoming him, respectfully saluting: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr., the things you want to investigate have been clarified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not Asked around the maid maid, he nodded calmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Walter followed him, all the way to the third floor, watching Richardson open the door of the study, lighting up the gas wall lamp inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walked slowly to the back of the desk, sat down and looked at the housekeeper, waiting for him to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter reminded Richardson to stay outside the door, while leaning close to the desk, deliberate on the language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door was closed again, he said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Vahana’s husband is The cloth merchant, who had previously worked with people, invested 1,000 pounds. As a result, the other party ran with the goods. She had already asked Mr. Maht and Mrs. Liana to ask the police to solve the case as soon as possible. However, this kind of thing, the police The department is not sure that it will find the target."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein picked up the black round belly pen on the desk and rubbed the next one:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For Ms. Vahana’s family, £1,000 is not a small amount.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as he knows Normal tutors will not earn more than £150 a year, and if the employer provides accommodation and food, there will be even less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Vahana serves a high society and has multiple employers, the annual income is at most four or five hundred pounds, and a large part of it has to be spent. Self-dressing, posture, and appearance, so as not to be considered by the employer to be decent enough to teach etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, her husband’s income is only moderate in the cloth merchants. For him, 1,000 pounds is a considerable investment." Walter euphemism Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me too... Klein sighed and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just came to Beckland and I am not familiar with the police department."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter immediately responded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., when I served with Viscount Conrad, I met a few people." Member of the Bakerland Senior Police Officers Association."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland Senior Police Officers Association? This is the upper class of the West Vilas field. The Chief Superintendent in charge of a district security is not eligible to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——West Vilas refers to the Beckland Police Department, named after the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the butler of the aristocratic family... Klein sighed and smiled and shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Not needed for the time being. In this regard, there are too many people who can seek help from Ms. Wahana. No matter who Mr. Maht is, or anyone else, there is enough capacity for West Vilas to pay attention to this case. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and pretended to say inadvertently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen this society The bottom layer, clearing their rules of survival, sometimes the police may not have gang members, bounty hunters.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Walter, you go to the police department to take Corresponding information, go to the famous bar in the Beckland Bridge area and the Eastern District, and release the reward task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether I found the appropriate criminal or found the fabric, I gave a reward of £200.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I only hope that the scammers will stay in Beckland. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"200 pounds bounty? Walter repeated the number and couldn't help but look at his employer. He couldn't believe he was willing to pay so much for Wahana's work.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Zhang I opened my mouth and seemed to want to remind me, but I didn’t say it in the end, just responded seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will give you the money directly." Klein slowly got up and took out the wallet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter took over the thick cash and thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell Ms. Wahana?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter has a sneak peek:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your generous and enthusiastic reputation will be This neighborhood is circulated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East District, Dalavi Street, a forced But the lively pub is inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully combing the short blond hair, I went out to the area full of wine and sweat, and came to the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slammed the plank and pointed at the bartender:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's new today? Entrusted?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s someone else, don’t ask for a drink, the bartender will definitely not take care of it, but seeing the opposite is Hugh, a person who would rather not drink her After the gold hunter, he could only sigh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a commission with a very rich bounty, £200."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"200 pounds?" Hsily almost suspected that he had misunderstood, except that she received a bounty at Miss Audrey, who had this level or even higher tasks. She had never been in the Eastern District and Beckland. The bridge area encountered a commission for so much money, even the Azick Aegis mission that had previously made the bounty hunters here crazy, only 150 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an ordinary bounty hunter, as long as you can complete this commission, it means you don't need to work again in a year! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of Hugh, this is equally important, because she has been working with mysterious people wearing golden masks for several months, and initially knows that the other party belongs to the military intelligence, and the accumulated merits can be exchanged for the “interrogator” potion formula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, she paid very little for helping the other person to do things, and most of them were turned into merits, and their savings depended on becoming a "security officer". Find and hunt down the superiority of the prisoner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got the potion recipe, I had to pay for the extraordinary materials, and I only have more than 300 pounds... Foers is right, money is not Almighty, but important enough... I think about it here, I look at the bartender and ask carefully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What mission? Who committed the commission?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking for a few liar, they lied about a fabric worth 1,000 pounds." The bartender took out the information and handed it to Hugh, saying, "The commissioner seems to be a butler, claiming to be a var. Special, for Mr. Daun Dontes of Berkrund Street, if you can catch a liar or find a fabric, you can go there to collect the bounty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hugh quickly looked at the information, the brain quickly generated the corresponding image, and intuitively had the direction of the search. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I took the task." She immediately looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender shrugged his shoulders:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not just you, all the bounty you have been to The hunters took over this task.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And they have other ideas. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What thought? Hugh asked curiously.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They said, Dawn. Mr. Dontes is so generous, if he still lacks bodyguards, they can recommend themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, they later gave up on this idea, because when the bodyguard did not make the bounty hunter free, even drinking must wait until the rest day."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a problem for me, but I can only be a bounty hunter... I nodded and jumped off the high chair in front of the bar, and did not waste time walking towards the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Klein runs out of lunch and is ready to go to his own garden Take a walk and eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the butler Walter came in from the outside, quietly followed him, waiting until there were no more people around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., two things," he said with a compliment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two things?" Klein was a little surprised, he thought there would be only one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val features the next line:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the first thing is about Baekeland Some 10% of the shares of the German bicycle company have already reached 10,000 pounds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to continue bidding? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ups up 1,000 pounds? Not bad! Klein thought about it as difficult:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I just came to Beckland, and many things must be restrained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it, just like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, sir." Val Specially said, "The liar who cheated Vahana’s husband’s cloth caught it, and the bounty hunter has come to the vicinity to request payment.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “So fast?” Klein staggered and looked at Mr. Guan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s his own shot, it’s really possible to solve it on the same day. After all, there’s a “buddle method” for people, but the problem is that the vast majority of bounty hunters are not Diviner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, maybe an extraordinary person who is good at tracking and tracing people... Kline made a preliminary judgment in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter definitely replied: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, much faster than I expected.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" According to the bounty hunter, she traced the backs of the stolen goods and found the few liar. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The channel for selling stolen goods is so easy to explain? It seems that it is an education that accepts iron fists... Klein gently sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the bounty hunter? Very capable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She claimed to be Hugh. Walter answered the truth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No... Klein almost stunned, but he has the super balance ability of the clown.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a meditation to calm down the waves in his heart, he said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave the bounty hunter Contact information, maybe there is a chance to ask her for help later. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, sir. Walter doesn't think that there is anything wrong with Don's instructions. A qualified civil society person always has some unofficial channels.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Klein did not continue to take the topic again, "Hmm" a voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is it to recover? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cash on the liar adds up to the fabric that has not been sold, for a total of 850 pounds. Walter seems to have already expected the employer to ask this question and have made an assessment in advance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Klein nodded. "After giving the reward to the bounty hunter, she helped her to send the liar and stolen goods to the nearest police station." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North District Police.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wahana and her husband Bakus looked at the opposite inspector and asked in surprise:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Get it back?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Catch the person?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior inspector The smile responded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much cash will he have left? Again, I heard that Vahana and Bakus were relieved at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150 pounds of money, they can still afford, and the remaining fabrics have room for appreciation and profit, overall, the loss is not large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They repeatedly thanked the police officers until someone came to ask Bakus to identify stolen goods and criminals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wahana sat there, without losing her manners, laughing at the senior inspector in front:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Your efficiency is beyond my imagination. I am very curious. How did you find those liar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that the beautiful and elegant lady is familiar with the lower house, Sooner or later, the senior inspector replied without concealing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, it was done by a bounty hunter, she started from the sales channel, very I’ve caught people soon.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you still have a reward?” Wahana seems to understand the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior inspector shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We haven’t had time yet, it’s released by others A reward of 200 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"200 pounds?" Wahana asked in amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a small amount, even more than the estimated profit of her husband’s business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the police officer’s affirmative response, Vahana couldn’t help but ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
