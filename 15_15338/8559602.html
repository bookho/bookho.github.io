			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange afternoon town invaded the real afternoon town? Dairik vaguely understood the "chief" speech and had a rough guess about the reasons for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suspected that when Mr. Fool pulled himself out of the strange afternoon town, he broke the balance there and let the power infiltrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also explains why the "Hunter" Colin Iliad repeated his attempt and why it didn't disappear on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Dairik thought about what kind of change this would bring, the six-member council "CEO" Colin had taken one of the belts from the dark There was a shimmering dust inside and sprinkled them into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust blew up and sprayed a silvery light, which was very noticeable in the dark and dark environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick, Joshua, and Heinham are all aware of the meaning of this signal, that is, don’t run around, stay in place, alert may come Attack the enemy, waiting for the rescue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that this was for the exploration team scattered around the rest of the afternoon town! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Demon Hunter" Colin released three consecutive signals in the interval of lightning, and then sideways to Dairik and others: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We meet from them from near to far.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful on the road. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Chief! "Dyrick has forgotten the grievances just now, and only hopes to help his companions as soon as possible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Colin’s instructions, he walked to the left side of the team, On the one hand, Joshua, who wears red gloves and raises the iron straight sword, the relatively stronger "Dawn Knight" Heinham falls to the end, and is separated from the "hunter" in front by about three steps.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-altitude lightning frequency alternates faster, the gloomy afternoon town is bright and sometimes dark, and the candlelights reflected in the windows are swaying, peaceful and quiet.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick is not the original rookie. At this time, although nervous, but the palm of the "Hurricane Axe" does not sweat, the line of sight is moving back and forth, guarding Monsters that may suddenly pop out in buildings on both sides.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lightning strikes, the world returns to darkness, and the candlelight in the afternoon is a little bit like waiting for the need Travelers who are staying.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the animal skin lanterns in Heinham’s hands are dimly lit But it is not far enough, and there is no effective night vision ability of Dairik.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its only function seems to be to dispel the dark black around.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Dairik’s neck was suddenly cool, and there was no cold wind around!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously Did not go straight back, slanted one step, half turned to the body, looking at the back with the corner of his eye.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Heinham staring at a height of two meters three gloomy stare With yourself, you have a big and wide straight sword in your hand!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rick’s body rolled over and avoided the blow, and the ear seemed to echo the fierce wind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he heard the voice of “chief” :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heinham attacked me! "Derek rolled up in the direction of the "hunter" Colin.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I? Heinham, carrying a leather lantern and holding a large straight sword in one hand, asked with a puzzled face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin looked at Dairik: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the speech, the "hunting demon" highlighted two dark green symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks around in a circle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can the attacker change to Heinheim?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s not falling, the silver straight sword clenched in his right hand slammed back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent collision, a figure emerged in the dark and gloomy environment. He has white and messy hair, deep decree, and vicissitudes. The deep blue eyes are covered with a silver straight sword painted with light gray grease, which is almost identical to the "hunter" Colin. The only difference is that his expression is gloomy and his skin is dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗噗噗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two silver straight swords collided continuously in mid-air and fired a spark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Colin Iliad screamed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Light !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light? Dairik instinct raised his hands and held it against his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, he found three figures in the darkness around him, one is tall and strong Heinham, and the other is a book of red gloves. Ya, one is the height of the height of the face still left childish Derick himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick did not panic, according to the "chief" command, let a relatively clear brilliance released from the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three figures seem to be very afraid of this, while lifting their palms, blocking their faces, while trying to escape to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, their speed is too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clear brilliance illuminates the surrounding area, and the three figures are completely submerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They opened their mouths and made a silent scream, but soon disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light rushes into the bright field with the two "hunters" in the fight, one of which immediately becomes stiff and sluggish, then loses color It is completely dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver straight sword coated with light gray grease penetrated the monster, but it seemed to stab the invisible air and failed to cause any harm. At this moment, the dark black monster suddenly burns itself, split into a twisted shadow, and melts in the light and flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Demon Hunter" Colin takes back the silver straight sword, sideways to Dairik and others:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This monster is our own shadow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The weakness of them is bright light! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, the "chief" of the six-member parliament has a clear and holy morning, and the whole street is like a dawn.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the extraordinary ability that the "Warrior" route can gain in the "Dawn Knight" stage. The reason why "Hunter" Colin is not used at first is because the effect is too obvious. I don't know what the accident will lead. Now, he has already understood the weaknesses of the monsters in the afternoon!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief of the morning is like a field, Heinham Abandoning the use of similar extraordinary ability, still carrying the animal skin lanterns, along with Dairik and Joshua, followed by Colin Iliad, turned to another street.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long, a group of four arrived at a church that had collapsed more than half.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This church originally had a tower, the overall adoption The classical stone pillars and brick arches are heavy and bleak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the altar, a figure wearing a simple white robe squatted there, whispering and praying that people could not hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not our people." Heinham, who also has night vision ability, has the highest score and found an abnormality in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that the shadows of our team members have become monsters... Dairik has helped Heinm in his heart to say the hidden meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this means unknown, unknown often means very dangerous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be a team of exploration here." Colin converges on the scope of his morning, so as not to stimulate the white robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinham, Joshua, and Dairik were silent and did not say a word. In this scenario, the exploration team did not appear basic in the first place. It means that the ending is not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They turned their heads, and at the door to the right of the hall, two men wearing tight-fitting black clothes were the members of the church exploration team. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chief, those shadows, those shadows have problems! La Roya was swallowed up by his own shadow!" One of the team members of the exploration team swept the "hunting "The Devil" Colin, immediately excited and afraid to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has anyone already sacrificed... Dairik’s heavy feelings, seeing the spread of the morning dawn spread out, including the two exploration team members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two players’ expressions suddenly stunned, but their bodies were fading. After only two seconds, they were like the shadows that were illuminated, and disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white bone, a mass of flesh and blood falling from their bodies and hitting the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of light is slowly coming out of these wrecks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin regained his gaze and said with no expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the priest first Listen to what it is praying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dairic and others silently nodded and stepped toward the collapsed statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten steps, they saw the appearance of the white robe from the oblique side. This is a middle-aged man with deep outlines and tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priesthood’s face was almost stuck to the floor tiles, and muttered to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The Almighty Lord, I repent, ... tempted Saslier, and the kings frequently fought in the palaces that belonged to the evening.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" People in the town did not know when it changed. They set up secret altars, held strange ceremonies, and did everything you could not allow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I found it all, but it was too late, degenerate, bloody, dark, rotten, killing, filth and shadows that had flooded the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The huge disaster will start here! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This discourse is repeated over and over again, just as a prophet is telling the tragic ending that will come with a low voice.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge disaster will start here? Is this land abandoned by the "creator of everything" from here? Also, who tempted the "dark angel" Sasliel? This clergyman should have a saying, because after the sentence "I regret", there is a blank that just happens to finish a name... He originally said it, but the name disappeared by himself? Who was erased? The clergyman should have appeared in the strange afternoon town after the balance was broken, otherwise he was discovered when he was last explored... Dairik flashed a lot of ideas in a short time.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw the "chief" stepping forward and walked to the priest who wore a simple white robe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
