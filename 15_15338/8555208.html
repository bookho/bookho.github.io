			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BMW City, Berg Home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the bloody scalp with short black hair, Dyke Horan thought of what it was like, it was a beautiful and seductive one. "Mushroom", he could hardly control it and swallow it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Dak wants to ask himself to eat the Dumu fruit, the bite will make a crispy Dumu fruit, it is a bloody, The pale skin of the human finger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Dairik’s stomach appeared violently, and the sour liquid rushed to the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He endured the urge to vomit, quickly sang a lyric with a male duck:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God, ask your kingdom to come here, the enemy will be gone, and the believers will be happy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This song reveals a little warmth and sacredness, wearing Rick only felt that all the discomfort of the body was calm, and the spirit became full and lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His courage, his strength, his agility, have been significantly improved in this song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the extraordinary ability of Sequence 9 "Singer". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dak stares at the singer and former teammate, his expression is getting darker and he doesn’t feel like human beings:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is in your body...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your body? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is on your body!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Dak’s clothing is propped up A strip of bar-shaped bulges, like a poisonous snake with a nest underneath, a snake that is constantly swimming and squirming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖! A bloody strip of meat penetrated the black tight-fitting clothing with rough skin with body hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roots of the meat strips danced out, making Dak like a bloody soft burr! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After brushing, the meat strips rushed to the stand of Dairik. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick is also a patrol team member who has seen a lot of monsters. There is not much panic in the face of this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He twisted his waist, raised his arm, and waved the "Hurricane Axe" that had been held in the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hurricane's axe smashed on several bloody strips and cut them directly, letting them fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, because it is now the "night" of Silver City, this blow can not bring lightning, more bloody flesh is coming in a frenzy, will be the hurricane The axe was wrapped around the circle and the death was not allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the weapon can’t be pumped back, there’s a pure light in the eyes of Dairik’s eyes, as if two small suns are coming into the room, and he’s One hand has been holding it in front of the nose and mouth, making a prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, a bright, burning pillar of light burning in the air, hit the bloody strip of meat wrapped in a group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dak gave a scream of incompetence, and a lot of bloody meat strips broke down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They struggle to beat, if there is life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the inner spirits contained in these bloody strips are no longer subject to the natural power of the original master, and the natural forces that are swaying by the sacrificial rituals are gradually merged. A rising red "wave". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "wave" was thrown into the dim candlelight, causing the latter to swell and become bigger, forming an illusory and mysterious door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a preparation in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this constitutes a sacrifice ceremony with simple steps but complete elements! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cracking of the seat, Dak rushed to Dairik with a bloody flesh of blood, no fear in his eyes, no tension, only the purest and most Hot cravings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein above the fog responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the voice of the real scream, the illusory door with many strange patterns broke through a gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the gap is a deep darkness, and there are countless transparent shadows in the dark that are difficult to describe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heights of these shadows are covered with seven pure brilliances of different colors with infinite knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the road Guanghua, there is boundless gray fog, an ancient palace overlooking the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, a shadow emerged from the dark corner, and it covered the nearest Dak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody strips that Dak wore in the week were all wrapped in dark, viscous "liquid", and the whole person became like an opaque drill. Bag of cats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow did not stop, quickly extended on the ground, flocked to Dairik, who had already evaded to another position, and shouted: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! What are you going to do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a monitor, his original intention was to Watching changes, recording the corresponding anomalies, and other situations become out of control, and then stop the strange sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he saw the illusory door full of strange symbols and logos cracked into a gap, but was shocked by the deep, mysterious, high-spirited, majestic scenes inside. Intuitively thought that this was related to the evil spirit of the horror, and had to inform and rush to act, trying to forcibly interrupt Dairik's attempt to sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Deric has already determined his position, the area he chose for himself is the one far from him, so to control this mysterious The boy of Amon possessed the body, the "shadow" of the watcher can only bypass or control Dak Rikins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his choice is the latter, because Dak apparently has an abnormality, leaving his back to him is absolutely stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take this opportunity, Dairik took out the iron box from the pocket of the garment and threw it at the illusion of the candlelight. The crack that presents a magical sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the iron box disappearing there, the door of the singular symbol and the logo, "Dangdang", closed and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Dairik remembered the shackles of "swinging people", deliberately twisted the muscles on his face and squatted toward the "shadow" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the "shadow" covered, he suddenly coughed hard, coughing his hand and covering his mouth, coughing and falling to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark shadow spreads over and completely wraps him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was quiet, but there were two huge black "cocoon" on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the dark, viscous liquid shrunk back and re-condensed into a shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the disappearance of the "cocoon", Dairik and Dak's figure appeared again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former fell there and fell into a coma, but in his hand he dropped a weird bug with twelve transparent rings, the latter has become a The flesh and blood, squirming, squatting, will launch an attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the pale fingers scattered on the ground and the blood-stained scalp with short black hair, the monitor involuntarily took a breath and manipulated the shadows outside with his extraordinary ability to form tidal waves, thus re-notifying the inside of the round tower. chief". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing this, he carefully examined the situation of Dairik and saw the translucent weird bug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...Amon hiding in Dairik's body is dead?" The monitor whispered quite surprisedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recalls the eccentricity of Dak, recalling the terrible change, recalling the "mushroom" and "Dumgo" that can't see any problems at all. ", there is a vague guess: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amon may be a deadly enemy behind the pollution Dak, in order to destroy the opponent's plot, even lose a avatar At the same time, Dairik went to the training ground to observe the exploration team and report them to the "chief". These two things are all tried by Amon without revealing himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the behind-the-scenes lord of the pollution Dak also vaguely discovered the eccentricity of Dairik, so Padak came to control each other, the bloody scalp and fingers were The props to achieve the purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the monitor suddenly agrees with the "chief" fear: the final doomsday or bigger disaster is really coming, so the Silver City will continue Encountering a strange thing, continuous encounters hiding in the depths of the dark do not know what is the secret existence of something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The round tower, in the chief room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "shadow" describes the original of the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin. Iliad with a white hair and a scar on his face listened quietly and sighed slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Derek or Amon is indeed prepared in advance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The candle with the symbolic symbol can make Dak expose the problem. Evil items, whispering prayers made by pouring water, and the sacrifice ceremony of the last item, all indicate that the whole thing is developing according to his plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two questions, one, who is the secret symbol on the candle, who is the god behind him? Second, why does Amon prefer? This avatar also wants to expose the exploratory team's anomaly, because he and the man behind the curtain are deadly enemies? What did he wait for forty-two years in Silver City?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does he predict this thing in advance, so he deliberately met the previous exploration team and let the lodge live in them, thus destroying the plot behind the curtain? This forty-two years of waiting is this moment? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the chief question, the "shadow" monitor suddenly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Maybe it is!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Chief', you think about why Amon waited patiently for forty-two years, but after Dairik was behind him, suddenly let Yudel lost control? Because the time in the prophecy is about to come, he is eager to change the parasitic object that can move freely to destroy the plot behind the curtain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really... ... We only thought about what's wrong with Dairik, and didn't think about the point in time." Silver City's "Chief" Colin responded thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "shadow" monitor immediately: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Chief', please control this immediately All members of the squad, they are absolutely problematic! Also... Elder Lloydya, she may be contaminated if she is not small!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lin Wei frowned: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before you return this thing, even before Dak goes out, Lovia comes to me and tells me, She suspected that the members of the expedition team were contaminated by something, and suggested that they should be secretly monitored and, if necessary, be allowed to guard the inverted mausoleum of Elder Havik."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
