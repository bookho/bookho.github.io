			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folding the letter paper, Klein took out the copper whistle, and put it to his lips, and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, he saw the illusory white bone on the desk being thrown by a root, turned into a fountain, and turned into a huge monster. It is still close to four meters, still dimmed, and still has its head out of the roof, which seems to be no different from the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shook his wrist and threw the letter up and saw the white bone monster firmly grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also blew the copper whistle, witnessing the "messenger" disintegrating into an illusory white bone, one root falling like rain and disappearing on the surface of the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, Klein settled a lot, but he didn’t stop trying, moved back to the chair, stood up, and walked four steps counterclockwise. Enter the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majestic palace and the ancient mottled table are reflected in his nephew, as if it has remained unchanged for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat down on the high back chair belonging to the "Stupid", silently untied the spirit of the left wrist cuff, and showed a yellow brown parchment and Round belly pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to divination for the captain tonight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a moment, Klein wrote the first divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dun. Smith’s anomaly can put me in danger.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——In mystery, divination involving self-security is the most difficult to be interfered with by external forces. Spiritual instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, as long as it is not particularly strong interference, Klein can get more accurate results in the divination involving his own safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the reason why he knew that Mrs. Xue Lun had the ability to interfere with divination, and that there was a danger of divination for the task. He knew that Mrs. Shelen was not strong. Can affect the extent of such divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, in order to determine the situation of Captain Dunn Smith, he decided to rule out all interference and divination on the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand held the spirit pendulum, Klein silently recited the divination statement seven times, and closed his eyes and entered the state of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stabilized for a few seconds, he opened his eyes and the darker twilight had returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the citrine pendant, and a heart gradually sank, because the spirit is making a clockwise rotation, the amplitude is not small, the speed is not slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that the answer is yes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that Dunn Smith’s anomaly can put him in danger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the danger is not low! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closed his eyes, Klein "wipe" the previous content and write a new divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason for Dunn Smith's anomaly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the citrine pendant, leaning back on the back of the chair, meditating on the divination statement, side Use meditation to enter the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the gray and illusory world, he saw nothing, and found nothing, except gray, or gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This shows that the information is not enough, the divination failed..." Klein stared at the parchment on the bronze long table, bitterly and helplessly whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he felt a strong exhaustion, understanding that this was the result of intense fighting, continuous use of the ceremony, and multiple divinations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wraping himself with spirituality, Klein fell into the fog and returned to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Klein, who is about to rotate the Chanis Gate, arrived at the Blackthorn Security Company in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the civilian staff, such as Mrs. Rosanne and Mrs. Oliana, were not yet at work, and Klein crossed the partition and looked at the open door and saw the captain. Dunn Smith in the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den took off his jacket and had only a white shirt and black vest on his upper body. He sat in the position with a cup of coffee in his hand and looked at the front. wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hair is slightly dry, gray eyes are dull, and the hard-lined face reveals a clear flaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the captain who has experienced many similar things, losing two teammates in a short period of time, it is unbearable... Klein’s heart is sour, my mind Neihuran came up with the broken mirror, which revealed Dunn’s half-squatting body and dark-stained face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gnashed his teeth, turned his head and looked to one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds passed, he took control of his expression and reached out to the door of the captain’s office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚,咚,咚. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng put down the coffee cup and the ashes regained their gloom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a breathless voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have reported things to the church They also made a preliminary reply."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church compensated Cohenli’s family for 3,000 pounds, and the police department gave 1,000 pounds of pension..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 4,000 pounds, which for most middle class, is a wealth that can not be reached in a lifetime... Cohenli’s weekly salary is 7 pounds, and the annual salary is 364 pounds. The bonus and extra income can reach at least 380 pounds, 4000 pounds is equivalent to his ten years of income... such a wealth, at least 200 pounds a year, can be used to make up for the death of Cohenri. The damage... Although money can't replace feelings, it can't replace Cohenli, but this is the only way to be relatively effective now... Kline has flashed a lot of thoughts, but the final export is a sigh:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only thing we can do is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Night Goddess In this respect and we will be very conscientious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng pulled the neckline and said low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go underground, will Luo Yao replaced it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his body and walked over to the door, hearing the captain’s almost self-talking supplement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "We will send Coenley to go home..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send Cohen to go home...his father, his mother, his brothers and sisters What kind of reaction will his fiancée have? Klein has a tight heart and is a bit grateful that he does not need to face that sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that this is a escaping mentality, but he is really afraid to see the grief-stricken eyes of Cohenri’s parents and his fiancee’s loss of soul-like performance, fear Seeing that they were hiding their expressions of grievances, they were afraid to hear the sound of sobbing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the footsteps, Klein came to the door of Chanis, silently completing the handover with Luo Yao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat in the duty room, and occasionally took out the silver pocket watch and saw the time pass by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, and Klein’s ear suddenly sounded a phantom stack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the back of the four black points, knowing that this is "justice," "upside down," or "the sun" praying to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just after taking out the key to open the door, Klein saw the maid Bella wiping the table, and sister Melissa and her brother Benson walked down the stairs in their outfits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you go to Mass before last week?" Klein asked a little strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can understand a person who has not slept all night Memory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Klein was even more at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today is the first day of the Open Book of Earl's Return." Melissa explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took his forehead and took off his hat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My time Too busy, I have forgotten this thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially these three days... He sighed and added one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa looked at him with concern:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your breakfast in the kitchen I’m going to sleep when I have eaten. Ben and I think that if I want to go out, I will go to the Church of St. Serena to attend the mass.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein waved goodbye to his brother and sister, simply used breakfast and returned to his bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be prepared, he reversed four steps into the fog, and saw the deep red stars corresponding to "justice" and "downside" are illusory Expansion and contraction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extended his right hand and spread spirituality, Klein’s ambiguous picture emerged, and the voice of Miss Justice was heard in the ear:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for your hearing."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the things of Qierlingus, my father invited an extraordinary person to protect me, and there are secrets that I don’t know. I managed to find an opportunity to pray for you. I think Next week's party is on leave, I believe that these will soon fade away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein subconsciously aimed at the blurred picture and saw the diffuse fog, I saw a giant bathtub that seemed to be wading in the water, and saw the "Justice" wrapped in a bath towel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He regained his gaze and began listening to the "inverted man" prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The description of the other party is different from "justice", but the same thing is prayed for, and he will also take time off because of the remnants of the Qilingus incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slightly decapitated and responded to their petitions separately:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he passed a thought to the deep red star corresponding to the "Sun":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The upcoming party is temporarily cancelled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of Silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick Berg is listening to the teachings on the training ground, the sky above his head is still dark, and from time to time he illuminates all the lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw a rich mist in front of his eyes, saw the ancient palace like the residence of the giant, and saw the high sitting in the depths of the fog. Mr. Fool," Mr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The upcoming party is temporarily cancelled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is still echoing, in front of Dairik Everything has been restored to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not surprised by this kind of magic, because every time before the party, Mr. "fool" reminds him like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
