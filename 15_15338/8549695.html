			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I don’t know if the note was ruined or hidden...but you can reason backwards, if you want to ruin it, you can On the spot, there is no need for me to take it away... When I heard Leonard’s question, Klein instantly turned on the “keyboard detective” mode and said with indulgence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Maybe I and Welch, Naya touched the unknown existence, enjoying the 'sacrifice' of life, and hope to continue to have similar things, so in the case that the 'suicide incident' will definitely be discovered, Let me take my notes, hide them, and prepare for the second 'enjoyment', but I don't know what happened during the process. I didn't succeed in suicide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a reasonable guess by Klein based on materials, novels, movies, and TV dramas that have been seen in previous life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for what went wrong in the process, he was very clear that it was more of his own "transformer". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good explanation, but I think, maybe there is another possibility, Welch and Naya’s suicide sacrifice, let the unknown existence have The possibility of coming, the note carries or breeds evil, let you take it away, hide it, worry about being 'born', before we find it, and destroy it directly." Leonard. Mitchell explained another possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he stared at Klein’s eyes and smiled slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The notes may have been destroyed in order to cover up the contents and cover up the objects that actually carry or nurture evil, so that your attempted suicide has enough reason to explain."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean? Is this doubting me? Do you suspect that the original body's body carries or breeds evil? No, he carries or nurtures the traversing person... The word "pregnancy" is okay... Klein groaned and secretly spit out and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I don't defend myself. After all, I really forgot that memory, but whether it is the captain or Ms. Dai Li, I confirm that I have no other problems. Your jokes are not funny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just exploring such a possibility, not to rule out that the unknown existence has suffered a blow, so that your suicide failed, we must believe that the goddess always bless us." Nader smiled and shifted the subject. "What did you find in the afternoon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the conversation and the previous events, Klein had a very good experience with Leonard. Deep alert, but the surface is quietly answering:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I have to change a route tomorrow afternoon."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the partition:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to go to the arsenal to receive the bullets. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "Shooting Club" will be open till nine, after all, it was a lot of members have free from work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the goddess protect you." Leonard smiled and drew a circle on the chest symbolizing the moon of blush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Klein through the partition, listening to the footsteps of his steps down the stairs, Leonard’s face gradually disappeared, and the green eyes were full of doubts. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He whispered something, a little dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the stairs, Klein walks quietly along the gas lamp Turned to a library of weapons, materials and literature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron gate is open here, the brown-haired girl Roshan is standing at the long table, and a middle-aged man with a thick black beard and a half-high hat. What the men exchanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the afternoon, no, good evening, here is always like a midnight, Klein, listen to the old Neil, you become an extraordinary person? Call it 'Divination' Home??" Rosanne turned his head and asked quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not hide her curiosity and concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon, Miss Rosanne, although it is always dark here But it makes people feel quiet. Your description is not accurate enough. It should be said that the name of the sequence potion I take is 'Divination'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still chose to be an extraordinary person..." Roshan sighed and said, and suddenly fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked to the middle-aged man next to him, politely asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other value night players, or one of the other two civilians I have not seen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosanna licked his lips:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bright, our colleague, he wants And I changed the order of the duty, and I will vacate the day after tomorrow. He wants to go to the North District Grand Theatre with his wife to see "The Pride" and celebrate their 15th anniversary of marriage. It is a romantic gentleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright smiles and reaches for the hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With Miss Rosanne, all things don't need to be repeated Hello, Klein, I didn’t expect you to be an extraordinary person so soon, and I, oh, maybe never have this courage.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s ignorant and fearless.” Klein ridiculed himself and reached out and shook hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a bad thing." Brett shook his head and smiled. "There was an extraordinary person who told me before death that I should never explore strange and dangerous things. The less you know, the longer you live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Roshan interjected:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Klein, you don't have to care too much. I listen to Old Neil. Your 'Divination' is auxiliary and relatively safe. As long as you don't try to communicate the unknown existence, how do you wear such clothes? Gentleman! What are you doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Getting 30 bullets today." Klein did not answer the question in front of Rosanne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes the girl will soon forget this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Rosanne pointed at the table. "Bright, they are all handed over to you. You should know the location of the keys and bullets, hey, old." Neil was stingy, and he didn’t have a hand to grind coffee. He promised to let me drink it today...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She’s awkward, Klein’s collar Came to the bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two separated from the ground and went to the "shooting club" on the Zoutelan street, one in the public carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold the gun, raise the arm, shoot, pull out the wheel, retreat the shell, and insert the bullet... Klein repeats the process over and over again, familiar and memorized The feeling of shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are several breaks between him to summarize and correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the practice, Klein used the venue to do a lot of sports like push-ups, trying to exercise and improve his physical condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was over, he returned home with a trackless public carriage, and he found that it was close to seven, and the sky was already dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein planned to go to the market or buy food for dinner on the street, he found that the door was open, and Melissa returned with a bag of stationery books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, she also carries a lot of dishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I think you and Banson will come back later today. When you go out in the morning, you take 1 Sule from where you are hiding money." Seeing my brother With a puzzled look, Melissa habitually explained it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have all taken the money, why not take the public carriage to school?" Klein reminded of the morning thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa slightly frowned: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I take a public carriage? 4 pence, 8 pence back and forth, count you and Benson, we will spend 24 pence on the public carriage in a day, a full 2 ​​Sule, a week, um, not Sunday, is 12 Sule, slightly equal to us The rent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop and stop, don't show off your math level... Klein pressed his hand with a funny smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa first paused, then added another sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I walked to school quite Ok, the teacher said that everyone has to exercise regularly, and I can pick up some broken parts on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein chuckled: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we count again, the public carriage costs 12 Sule, the rent 12 Sule 3 pence, a total of 1 pound 4 Sule 3 pence, with Benson The salary can be paid, and there are still a lot of surplus, um, he got the salary of last week... and I can get 1 pound 10 sol a week, even if I eat meat every day, even if I count gas, coal, The cost of wood, seasoning, etc., in the case of a little lunch, there is still a surplus, you can even order a morning newspaper, only 1 pence a day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait until two After a month, I can make up the salary of the advance payment, and I can save money to Benson and add new clothes to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, however, I Was considered accidental. "Melissa insisted the same point of view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at her with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then we can eat less meat, you Don't feel that spending 50 per day, no, one hundred minutes on the road, is a waste of time? You can use it to read more books, think more about problems, and improve your performance."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this way, Melissa can graduate with excellent grades and find a job with good salary. When is it, what are you worried about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He played the previous experience in the forum and people debate, finally convinced Melissa, let her agree to take the public carriage go to school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, finally flicked, no, how can you call it, this is called convincing people... Klein’s belly, took over the purchase of Melissa Dish, sigh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tomorrow remember to buy beef or lamb, chicken... eat well, eat well, in order to have a healthy body and a smart brain to deal with the difficult Learning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a matter of saying that you want to drool...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa I licked my mouth and silently for a few seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Supervising Melissa on the public carriage, Klein and Benson arrived at the company respectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just stepped into the gate and saw that Neil and Rosanne chatted at the reception desk. The former is still a classic black robe, and does not care about others. The latter, the latter changed to a bright yellow dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Mr. Neil, Miss Rosanne." Klein took off his hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil gave him a narrow look:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, I didn’t hear it last night. "What should I not hear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I slept very well." Klein was also very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only be attributed to his inspiration is not high enough...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, don't care, Actually, it’s not so easy to hear.” Old Neil pointed to the breakout. “Go to the arsenal and continue our 'mystery course' this morning.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein nodded, followed the old Neil down the stairs, into the ground, to the arsenal, replacing the night of Bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you need to learn today?" Klein asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil has a long bang: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complex, basic Knowledge, but before that, teach you an interesting technique."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
