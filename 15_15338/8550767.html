			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of his sister's problems, Klein can only smile with a bitter smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Muscle soreness." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally thought that taking the sequence of potions, becoming a peculiar person will have more or less physical improvement, but the cruel facts tell him, "Divination The skills of the family are based on spirituality, spirit, intuition and interpretation, and do not allow him to adapt quickly to combat training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original owner has been focusing on reading for many years and some malnutrition, so that the physical quality has been at a moderately low level. Today, such "sequel" can only be said to be quite normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Muscle soreness? I remember that you came back after dinner yesterday and didn't do anything else... Is alcohol causing muscle soreness?" Melissa I was very eager to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does alcohol cause muscle soreness...Sister, you asked this sentence... It’s really unconscious to think about it... Ryan laughed at two channels: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, nothing to do with alcohol, it was yesterday afternoon, I joined the company's fighting training."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fighting?" Melissa was even more surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quickly organized the language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like this, I think, I I think that as a security company's history and cultural relics consultant, I can't stay in the office forever, stay in the dock warehouse, maybe there will be a day in the future, I need to go to the country with them, go to the castle, and get the cultural relics. The initial location, on the way will climb the mountain, will cross the river, will go a lot of roads, will accept a variety of natural tests, which must have a healthy body."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you join the fighting training to improve your body?" Melissa understood the meaning of her brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Klein gave a positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa slightly frowns:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is not a gentleman...you Isn't it always required to be taught by the standards of the professor? The professor only needs to read the literature, consider the problem, and have a graceful manner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I am not saying this. Ok, I like men who can solve problems by themselves, whether they use muscles or their brains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, no, Melissa, there is a certain misunderstanding of the definition of the professor. The real professor can both communicate gracefully with people, or when communication is in trouble. Raise the cane and convincing the other person physically."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Physical way..." Melissa didn't respond, but soon understood her brother. I want to express the meaning, but I can't find a language rebuttal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t say anything more, struggled to move his legs and moved to the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa stood there, watched for a few seconds, suddenly shook her head and chased it in two steps:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need my help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave a helping posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, I have some ingredients for the show." Klein felt insulted and suddenly straightened his back and walked normally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at his brother’s steady pace into the bathroom and closing the door, Melissa snorted and whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein is getting more and more exaggerated... I thought his muscle soreness was so serious..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the washroom, Klein stood behind the closed door and his face suddenly twisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not until the hardships went downstairs, after breakfast, and when Benson and Melissa went out, he felt sore and no longer so terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a break, Klein took a cane, put on a top hat, and walked slowly to the site of the rail public carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hove University in the summer, trees, flowers and birds, Peace and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long walk along the river, Klein turned into the road to the history department and found the three-story gray stone building that was some years old. Tutor Cohen Quentin's office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked on the door and saw the position of the instructor sitting on the teacher Azick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Mr. Azick, my mentor? We met at ten o'clock in the letter," Klein asked doubtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cohen Quentin’s good friend, often with his arguing with academic issues, Azke laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cohen has a meeting and went to Tining University, let me wait for you here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His skin is bronzed and medium in size. The black hair is brown, the facial features are soft, there is always an indescribable feeling of vicissitudes in the eyelids, and there is a small cockroach hidden under the right ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the reason, Azick frowned and carefully looked at Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any rudeness on my body?" Klein looked at his dress blankly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Tuxedo, black vest, white shirt, black bow tie, dark trousers, leather boots without buttons... It's normal...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick Stretching the eyebrows, hehe smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not care, I just suddenly found that you are much more spiritual than before, more like a gentleman."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your compliment." Klein accepted openly and asked, "Mr. Azick, the instructor found the book "Honachs" in the school library. "The study of the ancient ruins of the main peak"?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found, with my help." Azick smiled softly and then opened the drawer. Take out a book with a gray cover. "You are not a student at Hoy University. You can only watch it here and you can't take it away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good . Klein joy implicit fear that took over this academic monographs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design of this book is completely in line with the current trend, the hard cover is made of the cover and the back cover, the pattern is the picture, and it has become the main peak of Hornachs. Abstract look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at it, found a position to sit down, flipped through the books, and read them line by line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was fascinated, and suddenly found a cup of coffee at hand, the scent is full and rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I add sugar and milk." Azick put down the silver plate and pointed to the milk can and the candy box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Klein nodded gratefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added three cubes of sugar and a spoonful of milk, and continued to read the book without knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study of the ancient ruins of the main peak of Hornachs is not thick. Near noon, Klein flipped through and grasped a few notes. The point: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I. The main settlement of Hornachs and the surrounding area has clearly formed a civilization, there is an ancient kingdom."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Second, from the perspective of murals, their appearance is no different from human beings, and can be regarded as human beings initially."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Fourth, the strangest thing is that the tombs of this country have not been found in the entire region, giving people a strange illusion that their residents do not need to be buried or even die, and this contradicts the content of the mural reaction. In the murals, the people of this country believe that death is not the end. I believe that the deceased relatives will protect themselves in the dark, so they will leave the dead relatives at home, stay in bed, and stay on the pillow for three days. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After that, the murals do not cover the part of the burial."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ryan took a sip of coffee and continued to write "reading" in his notebook:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mother of heaven, the mother of heaven, the name of the very tall, and the night The dominance is obviously overlapping with the goddess of the night... is this the source of the contradiction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the exhibitions in the ancient ruins of the main peak of Hornachs and the surrounding area The furnishings and the furnishings are well preserved, and the murals are not damaged or damaged. Before, it didn't seem to be disturbed at all... There was a plate on the table, and there was a dry rotting trace on the plate... In some rooms, there was half a bottle of wine that almost became clear water...”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people of this country? They seem to have left their homes in a hurry, nothing has been cleaned up, and have not returned."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s even more strange to think of no tombs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Joseph also talked about the initial When he discovered these ruins, he even thought that the residents here had evaporated instantly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stopped the pen and turned his eyes to an illustration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the black and white photo taken by John J. Joseph with a new camera when he went to the main peak of Hornachs for the third time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the photo, the palace is smashed, the walls are collapsed, the weeds are crowded, and the style is dominated by grandeur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I turned to this photo, Klein instantly remembered the palace she had seen in her dreams:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style of the two tends to be the same, but the one that dreams of is at the top of the peak, more magnificent, and there is a huge seat that is not human, at the top, there are countless transparent locusts In a group, slowly creeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can confirm that my dreams are related to the ancient ruins of the main peak of Hornachs...that should be the night mentioned in the Antignus family notes. Country... Klein nodded invisibly and closed the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Azick sat across from him and touched the humble black skull below the right ear:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Is there something to gain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are quite a few, you see, I have taken a lot of notes." Klein pointed at the table and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand why you are suddenly interested in this matter." Azick sighed and said, "Klein, I am in Baker." When Rand was in college, he was exposed to some divination. There was some research on this aspect. Well, I found that your fate has some inconsistencies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;啥? Divination? Talking to me about divination? As a "diviner", Klein looked at the opposite Azick teacher with a funny smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the inconsistency?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azk thought for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have been meeting coincidences for the last two months." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Coincidents?" Because of the favor of Mr. Azko, Klein did not resist the other party's problems, and the subconscious began to think back:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that coincidence, the most obvious thing is to hunt down the kidnappers, and found the missing Antignus family notes across the room where they were hiding. The clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
