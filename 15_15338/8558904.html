			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washing room, wet and dry partition, diffuse water vapor enveloped the entire bathtub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the head, Klein was immersed in hot water, lying comfortably, and didn't even want to move his toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a wonderful night...If there is no Cynthia outside, just wait for her to wait for her... Klein sighs and considers how to make excuses later. Avoid things close to you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the characteristics of Admiral Levitte, he decided to start with work, followed by the recent discomfort, because of the loss of the ability to deal with that aspect Just taking a drug takes a certain amount of digestion, suddenly awakening the real sexual orientation to see the curls are all eyebrows and other reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to whether this will damage the image of Admiral, Klein has no psychological pressure, as long as Cynthia is not suspected of being a fake Amyrius. Witt, he completed the task satisfactorily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to explain those excuses afterwards, how to find reasons to return to normal, are questions of Admiral Amyrius, and what is the relationship with my German Sparrow ? What is the relationship between the corrupted image of German Sparrow and my Sherlock Moriatti? Klein stood up comfortably, walked wet outside, wrapped in a bath towel, and wiped his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In exchange for the bathrobe hanging there, Klein took a breath and silently lifted the anti-lock as the enemy, and unscrewed the door of the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the empty corridor, only the light from the two side lights illuminate the dark aisle, Klein relaxed a little, not so tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is almost the same as challenging the pirate generals... In the meantime, he suddenly found a serious problem, that is, he does not know which master bedroom Which is the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, you must say hello to Cynthia, otherwise it will appear as "Amirius" Admiral guilty... Klein recalls the pattern of similar houses Try to find the master bedroom accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door of the diagonally opposite room opened and only Cynthia, who had set up a silk robe, came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She blonde hangs slightly in a mess, even a few squatting in front of the blue eyes and bright red lips, let the sun shine halfway, lips like It seems to be closed, and it is extremely attractive in a dimly lit environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silk robe has a large neckline, and snow white and gully reflect Klein’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein almost looked up and looked at the ceiling to escape this strong excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm, calm, you are Amyrius Levitt...and you are also a lover who has seen the ** witch... compared to the "disease girl" The charm of this lady is obviously not enough... Wait, why do I want to think about the witch, who knows whether they used to be male or female... Klein maintains his gaze, even “plays” from top to bottom, and from Look up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he can feel the original desire, but the lower body has no movement...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This is the second manifestation of the temporary contract? In fact, Admiral Amyrius does not need to be so troublesome, even if there is an impulse, I can control myself... What scene have I not seen?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... Cynthia and the information are a bit different, not that she became a mistress of Amyrius for a year or two, and most of the time she saw Going to the other side, I can’t open it on that kind of thing, every time I have to be squatting? How do you have a tendency to seduce today? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it felt that the status is not stable, or has she been replaced?" Since becoming a "faceless person," Klein sees everyone as fake. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cynthia’s eyes are drooping, and the courage to forcibly swelled a little under the examination of Amyrius, and her face gradually became a thrilling blush, and her heart was ashamed. And a little bit proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, she heard the admiration of the lord calmly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me prepare coffee, put To the study.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a lot of things to deal with tonight, you don't have to wait for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Cynthia looked up and her face was still red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She could not understand the words of Admiral Amyrius for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quietly took a breath, hugged each other and kissed his forehead:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I will be with you in a few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This response comes from the information, he just changed the word slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, if it wasn’t for some prior knowledge, Klein would have thought that Admiral Amyrius would also be on the bed when he was with the mistress. With that face, it is very serious to say what to do. However, this demigod also has a soft tone, a side of laughter and flirtation, but is not very good at telling love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes him understand one thing, that is, many people only look at the surface, it is impossible to imagine that he is private, "no face" to do Real camouflage must have a detailed investigation and full understanding, just as the magician does not perform unprepared performances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cynthia showed a clear disappointment, but soon converge on those emotions, piled up with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General, your pajamas are in the room, bathrobes are not suitable for handling things. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is consistent with the information, more considerate, understanding and understanding... Klein looked at Cynthia and turned into the house, pulling the bell, and he took the opportunity. Take off the bathrobe and put on the dark red pajamas and the same color pajama pants.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cynthia opens the study door attentively, making the slightly messy table simple After a while, I waited for the maid to make a good coffee, took it by myself, and sent it in.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, Klein looked through the documents and materials, Very professional, but in fact, he has little knowledge about the data and design concepts of ships such as ironclad ships and sail battleships, and is almost the same as illiterate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the field, he only knows the concept of aircraft carrier, air superiority, giant ship cannon, and multiple turrets.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the eye sees Cynthia leave silently and closes the door, gram Ryan was completely relieved and knew that it was mixed tonight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the master bedroom, Cynthia licked her lips and took the necklace from under the pillow, holding only the knuckle-sized black rhinoceros horns on the palm.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood there and whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great desire mother tree, please make me more attractive, let Ai Mi stay Sergeant is more obsessed with me, so that he can experience the ultimate happiness from me and give me a child..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quiet study room, Klein Shasha flipped through the documents piled up in front of him, and according to the way of processing the data, he simply picked it up and brushed it with Amyrius. Levitt's name - he can imitate handwriting because "no face" can remember the characteristics of the target, "clown" provides precise control.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Complex, those who don’t understand, Klein wrote similar instructions:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Re-examine. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Busy" until the early hours of the morning, Klein stretched out his mouth and yawned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;No, you have to sleep, there are still many challenges tomorrow, you have to keep your energy... Klein thought about it and gave up the plan to return to the master bedroom.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He lifted his right hand, held the eyes closed in half and half, slammed down and moved them to the sides of the middle of the bridge of the nose.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Klein separated the two gaps in the position where the original eyes were, and pretended to have a pair of fake eyes with flesh and blood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After becoming "no face", I am more and more like a monster... If I go to school, there will be such a magical skill... He sighs silently, just half-baked, his eyes closed, and his eyes open and "see" The document falls asleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
