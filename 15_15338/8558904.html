			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washing room, wet and dry partition, diffuse water vapor enveloped the entire bathtub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the head, Klein was immersed in hot water, lying comfortably, and didn't even want to move his toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a wonderful night...If there is no Cynthia outside, just wait for her to wait for her... Klein sighs and considers how to make excuses later. Avoid things close to you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the characteristics of Admiral Levitte, he decided to start with work, followed by the recent discomfort, because of the loss of the ability to deal with that aspect Just taking a drug takes a certain amount of digestion, suddenly awakening the real sexual orientation to see the curls are all eyebrows and other reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to whether this will damage the image of Admiral, Klein has no psychological pressure, as long as Cynthia is not suspected of being a fake Amyrius. Witt, he completed the task satisfactorily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to explain those excuses afterwards, how to find reasons to return to normal, are questions of Admiral Amyrius, and what is the relationship with my German Sparrow ? What is the relationship between the corrupted image of German Sparrow and my Sherlock Moriatti? Klein stood up comfortably, walked wet outside, wrapped in a bath towel, and wiped his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In exchange for the bathrobe hanging there, Klein took a breath and silently lifted the anti-lock as the enemy, and unscrewed the door of the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the empty corridor, only the light from the two side lights illuminate the dark aisle, Klein relaxed a little, not so tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is almost the same as challenging the pirate generals... In the meantime, he suddenly found a serious problem, that is, he does not know which master bedroom Which is the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, you must say hello to Cynthia, otherwise it will appear as "Amirius" Admiral guilty... Klein recalls the pattern of similar houses Try to find the master bedroom accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door of the diagonally opposite room opened and only Cynthia, who had set up a silk robe, came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She blonde hangs slightly in a mess, even a few squatting in front of the blue eyes and bright red lips, let the sun shine halfway, lips like It seems to be closed, and it is extremely attractive in a dimly lit environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silk robe has a large neckline, and snow white and gully reflect Klein’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein almost looked up and looked at the ceiling to escape this strong excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm, calm, you are Amyrius Levitt...and you are also a lover who has seen the ** witch... compared to the "disease girl" The charm of this lady is obviously not enough... Wait, why do I want to think about the witch, who knows whether they used to be male or female... Klein maintains his gaze, even “plays” from top to bottom, and from Look up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he can feel the original desire, but the lower body has no movement...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This is the second manifestation of the temporary contract? In fact, Admiral Amyrius does not need to be so troublesome, even if there is an impulse, I can control myself... What scene have I not seen?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... Cynthia and the information are a bit different, not that she became a mistress of Amyrius for a year or two, and most of the time she saw Going to the other side, I can’t open it on that kind of thing, every time I have to be squatting? How do you have a tendency to seduce today? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it felt that the status is not stable, or has she been replaced?" Since becoming a "faceless person," Klein sees everyone as fake. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cynthia’s eyes are drooping, and the courage to forcibly swelled a little under the examination of Amyrius, and her face gradually became a thrilling blush, and her heart was ashamed. And a little bit proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me prepare coffee and put it in the study.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a lot of things to deal with tonight, you don't have to wait for me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Cynthia looked up and her face was still red.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a moment Unable to understand the words of Admiral Amyrius.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quietly took a breath, hugged each other and kissed his forehead:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will stay with you in a few days. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This response comes from the information, he just changed the word slightly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly Speaking, if it wasn’t for some understanding beforehand, Klein would have thought that Admiral Amyrius would have a face when he was on the bed while he was getting along with the mistress, saying that what he did was very serious, however, this half God also has a soft tone, a flirtatious side, but is not very good at telling love.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes him understand one thing, that is, many people only look at the surface It is impossible to imagine that he is private. The "no face" must be carefully investigated and fully understood to be true disguise, just as the magician does not perform unprepared performances.<br /><br />&nbsp Cynthia showed obvious disappointment, but quickly converge on those emotions and piled up a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General, your pajamas are in the room, bathrobes are not suitable for handling things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This is consistent with the information, more considerate, and understandable... Klein looked at Cynthia and turned into the house, pulling the bell, and he took the opportunity to take off the bathrobe and put on the dark red pajamas and the same color. Pajama pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cynthia opened the door of the study diligently, and handled the slightly messy table for a while, then waited for the maid to make a good coffee, took it by hand, and sent it in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, Klein looked at the documents and materials and put on a very professional look, but in fact, the data of ships such as armored ships and sail battleships. And the design concept, he has little understanding, and is similar to illiterate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In similar fields, he only knows the concepts of aircraft carriers, air superiority, giant ship cannons, and multiple turrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the eye, seeing Cynthia leave silently and close the door, Klein breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that it was mixed tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the master bedroom, Cynthia licked her lips and took the necklace from under the pillow, holding only the knuckle-sized black rhinoceros horns on the palm . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood there and whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great desire mother tree, please let I became even more moving, and I was more obsessed with Admiral Amyrius, so that he could experience the ultimate happiness from me and give me a child..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quiet study room, Klein Shasha flipped through the documents piled up in front of him and sorted them out according to the way they were processed. Brushed the name of Amyrius Levitt - the reason why he can imitate the handwriting is because "no face" can remember the characteristics of the target, "Clown" provides precise control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complex, those who don’t understand, Klein wrote similar instructions:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Re-examine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Busy" until the early hours of the morning, Klein stretched out his mouth and yawned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you have to sleep, there are still many challenges tomorrow, you have to keep your energy... Klein thought about it and gave up his plan to return to the master bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted his right hand, pressed the two half-closed eyes, yanked down and moved them to the sides of the middle section of the bridge of the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
