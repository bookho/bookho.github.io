Leonard, who first arrived, held the revolver in his hand and asked in a loud voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that he couldn’t stop the car, Klein suddenly thought of what Roshan had mentioned. Three years ago, he became a "sleeper". In the absence of adapting to the power of the potion, Nader tried to finish the stairs at the speed of the sprint, and turned into a wheel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a light cough, Klein pointed to the door of Chanis:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The sound came out from inside and later became a slap. Later, the door was pushed a little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Chanis Gate was pushed away? "The short Denko Cohen is wrong and asks." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, was pushed open a gap." Klein was about to continue to describe, but saw that Leonard, Cohenri and Luo Yao were not close to the duty room. , stopped a few steps away, and scattered into an arc, seems to be guarding yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are doubting me?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not doubt, this is a normal process." Cohen Li shook his head and denied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a tense atmosphere, Leonard still smiles with a lack of seriousness:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In other parishes, there have been such cases. The extraordinary people who watched the doors of Chanis lost control, and they rang the bells. Then the teammates who came to help didn't pay attention and even killed two people."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein no longer had the wronged grievances and anger, and instead asked, "How can I prove that I am not out of control?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard converges with a smirk, and points four times on the chest, his voice whispering deeply:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are naked Naked, no clothes, no food, no cover in the cold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They were wet by the rain, because there is no shelter, they hold the rock." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are the mothers whose children were taken away. They are orphans who have lost hope. They are the poor who have been forced to leave the right path."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "The night did not give up and gave them care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sacred and pitiful prayers echoed in the earth, so that everyone's body, mind, and spirit were all quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Klein has no abnormal reaction, Leonard stops mourning and outlines the smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, you are still our trusted companion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold lady who has been silent for a long time looked at Chanis Gate and asked :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did you see after the door was pushed a little?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw The doomed puppet, wearing the black classical court dress, 3—0625.” Klein still had a little bit of fear and answered, “But no more than three seconds, it was pulled back by the invisible force, Chanis Gate And then shut down again. What is the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard and Cohenli and Luo Yao respectively looked at each other:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, we are just like you, it is not clear why, since the Chanis Gate has been closed again, there are no more exceptions, then we should not enter at this time. ., We must wait for dawn, waiting for Captain "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"I will stay here and stay with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Leonard spread his hand and joked, "As the most here." Strong man, I also stayed, Cohenli, you go back to the second floor, so that the police department can not open the door in an emergency case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cohenli did not say much, Immediately nodded and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Leonard looked at Klein and Lorraine respectively: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Maybe we can continue to play cards? In this case, we need some entertainment to make us not too tight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Klein adjusts the revolver, will It put back the gun pocket under the arm, Luo Yao did not say agree, did not say disagree, wearing a soft and smooth black hair, followed by entering the duty room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The landlord, no, fighting evil, Klein likes to say casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dooms, I mean 3-0625, according to the description of the data, it should not have the characteristics of living ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, 3 A. Leonard pressed his hand and said in a chat. "In the past 40 years, 3 - 0625 did not show the characteristics of alive. We can assume that the description of the data is correct, as a premise to reason and deduct. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Over. Do you have an idea?" Luo Yao asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein hesitated whether or not to drop three "2"s, Leonard drank the freshly brewed coffee track:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, since 3-0625 itself does not have a living character, its performance today must be due to other factors, and is a factor that has only recently emerged. Otherwise, it should have let us see this side of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what is different after the Chanis Gate in the last month?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Yao looked at Klein’s three “2s” and sighed for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "There is only one thing that is different from the past, that is, the notes and seals of the Antigonus family '2-049' have been spent one night behind the Chanis Gate."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard looked at the cards in his hand and smiled at the table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the bad luck puppet is abnormal , '2-049' has long been in the Bains of Beckland After making similar incidents, I suspect that the problem is from the notes of the Antignus family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought carefully, could not help Frequently nod:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is probably the biggest... Leonard, I didn't expect you to be a good at reasoning."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, romantic poets and good at reasoning are incompatible...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just because he recently loved to look at detective stories." Luo Yao stated plainly next to him, "Two kings, 8 to K straight, no one wants? Three 6, no."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing this scene, Klein and Leonard Qiqi fell into silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t concentrate on playing cards and they forgot a crucial thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this Zhongluo Yao is "evil"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at Luo Yao cut cards, Klein once again seized the opportunity to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What power is pulling back 3-0625?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard gave him a look, hehe laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You wouldn't think that the protective measures behind the Chanis Gate are only buried in the seal room and several elderly guards?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"The power inside reaches its peak at night, no longer suitable for living things. When the sun rises, it will weaken. This is why the captain lets us not enter the Chanis Gate no matter what sound we hear."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the captain forgot to tell me this reason... Klein wondered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection against the array?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a magnified version of the spell and amulet? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Luo Yao nodded when he touched the card. "The reason why the Chanis Gate is placed under the central church of each city is to use the daily The believers who have come to maintain, their pious prayers will let some spirituality enter the law, and accumulate a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way..." Klein nodded I saw a bad card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Leonard smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Protection measures behind the door More than this one, St. Serena’s ashes were buried inside, and she was a high-ranking strongman before her death.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Selina’s ashes ? The ashes of high sequence strong? Holy Ashes? What can this do? Klein was puzzled and curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Selena is a saint during the establishment of the Goddess of the Night, active in the ancient Third Age, and recorded in various holy scriptures. Therefore, in the people who believe in the goddess of the night, Selena is a common name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard seems to have heard of Klein’s voice and said to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumor has it that the corpse or ashes left behind by the death of a high-ranking sequence still has incredible power. Of course, this is just a rumor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded slightly, Turn your attention back to the poker in your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few hours, there was no abnormality after the Chanis Gate, but Klein lost the whole two Souls, and he was very distressed. Leonard, who is also full of romantic poetry, lost 4 Sule 5 pence, and only the unspeakable Luo Yao is the winner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sun has just risen, and it’s my turn." The quiet "writer" Ms. Seagate Thorn entered the duty room at six o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wrote the story of last night on the record book, and returned to Blackthorn Security Company with Leonard and Luo Yao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, his expression is extremely exhausted, and the "Midnight Poet" and "Non-sleeper" next to him are still in the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the difference between different sequences..." Klein was about to go through the partition, go home to sleep, and suddenly saw the captain open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, captain." He couldn't help but yawn when he greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den, wearing a black trench coat, took off his hat and swept him with ashes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Good morning, you should go back to rest, what happened last night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is going to do bad luck with the puppets and Leonard’s The reasoning is briefly said again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Dunn did not express his opinion, and Shen Ning went to his office. "I will take a telegram to ask about the church."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t stop again, stepping out of No. 36 Zouteland Street and breathing into the cool morning air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spirit is a revival, and suddenly remembers something that has been forgotten before:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I forgot to tell the captain and Leonard what they have in the hands of the doom puppets!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I forget?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
