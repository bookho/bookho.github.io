			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the abandoned medical school building, the party has ended, and Audrey, who is leaving the circle, suddenly squats and sees the familiar fog and The blurry figure in the center of the sorghum fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a clue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the low voice of Mr. Fool, it’s a photo Scenes, and still have color photos! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man who is not nearly as strong as a black priest’s suit in the shadow of two meters is in the shadow, the yellowish hair is soft and soft, and the dark brown eyes are cold and indifferent. There is a fierce hiding in the mouth, the mouth is slightly drooping, and the loneliness is like a wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cluster? The clues to the Dalavi Street explosion in the Eastern District and Gavin’s loss of the drowning incident? Is this the murderer? Audrey was stunned and immediately realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool" has a clue... He is really powerful, no, omnipotent... After a deep feeling, she turned her head and looked to her side. Firth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folse just took off the mask, took off the surgical cap, and sat in the carriage, and noticed that Miss Audrey had a slightly strange look, immediately questioned道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there anything on my face?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Li took back the line of sight and sat down to remove the camouflage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fols recalled the previous party, and asked curiously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Julie, why didn't you buy the 'audience' formula? So you can establish a connection with the psychological alchemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembers the generous Austrian Ms. Li remained silent almost throughout the game, listening most of the time, only selling some spiritual materials and purchasing another variety accordingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my first time in this circle Party, I think observation and waiting are more important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking forward to the recipe of the potion, looking forward to more magical items, but I told myself that there is no need to do this. Urgently, getting familiar with the action is a better strategy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the "professional habit" of the "audience" approach, and there is no evil pattern black panther spinal cord Liquid, elf spring medullary crystal and other extraordinary materials that Mr. "World" wants... Audrey silently added a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fols looked at the girl who was under 18 years old and suddenly felt that the other person was more mature than ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly laughed at herself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I could be like you, it wouldn't Waste valuable opportunities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey held a smile and responded by saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I will ask some special friends tomorrow morning to see if they have clues to the Dalavi Street bombings. You and Hugh are waiting for the news in the old place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Okay." Fols nodded without doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t return to Minsk Street late at night and slept directly One bedroom in Black Palm Street in the Eastern District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was afraid that the man who suspected the murderer wearing the black priest’s suit had the same party, and was looking for himself at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the probability of encounter is not high, and he has also disguised before, the other party can hardly recognize it, but since the result of divination indicates that there is a certain possibility, then Klein was cautious and made a sleep in the East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was just getting bright, he put on another dark blue worker's uniform, put on a light brown cap, left the room, went down the stairs, and entered the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein buried his head and hurried on the road, exactly the same as the pedestrians who worked early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When walking, he saw a 40-year-old man in front of him, two white-skinned, middle-aged men in thick jackets are constantly stumbling, and Trembling a cigarette and a box of very empty matches from the inside pocket of the garment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just opened the matchbox, his right hand suddenly shook, and the crumpled cigarette fell to the ground and rolled to Klein’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stopped his own steps, picked it up and handed it to the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, thank you! This is my old man, there are not a few left." The middle-aged man sincerely thanked and took the cigarette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face is white, the beard is not scratched for a long time, the meaning of exhaustion is unreservedly revealed from the corner of the eyebrow, lamenting a sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t slept for another night, I don’t know if I can still hold on for a few days, I hope the Lord will bless me and let me enter the almshouse today."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the driven tramp... Klein asked casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are the kings and ministers not allowed? Are you sleeping in the park?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows? But in this weather, sleeping outside, it is very likely that you can never wake up again, or it is good during the day. Find a place to warm up, hey, so there is no time to physically find a job." The middle-aged man lit the cigarette and took a sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His energy seems to have recovered a bit, and Klein walked side by side, not knowing where the fog is at the end or in the depths of the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has no cold thoughts and intends to speed up to get rid of him, but at this moment, he suddenly saw the middle-aged man who was clearly organized and bent down from the ground. Picking up a dark thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be a very clean Apple core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man swallowed his mouth and stuffed the dirty earth-filled fruit into his mouth, biting it, and then expertly All eaten, no residue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Kline’s strange eyes, he wiped his mouth, shrugged, and smiled bitterly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't eaten for three days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence hits Klein's heart and makes him inexplicable Touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed silently and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I didn’t introduce myself. I am a journalist and I am doing a report about the tramp. Can I interview you? Let's go to the cafe in front."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man 愣A moment, I immediately laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, it is much warmer than the street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If you can finish the interview, stay for a while, let me sleep for half an hour, no, a quarter of an hour, that would be better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Klein opened his mouth and didn't know how to answer it. He simply led the "interviewee" to the cheap cafe in the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tables and chairs of the cafe are quite greasy. There are many walls and windows, and the average temperature is indeed higher than the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man grabbed his throat and concealed his throat because of the scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein motioned him to sit down and came to the place where he ordered, and ordered two large cups of tea, a plate of tender pea stewed lamb, two loaves of bread, Two toasts, one inferior butter and one artificial cream, totaling 17.5 pence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me?" The middle-aged man looked forward and asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides a piece of toast and a cup of tea, the rest are yours." Kline smiled and responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man wiped his eyes and said a little choked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... You, you are really a good person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are hungry for a long time, don't eat too fast," Klein muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, I have an old man who died like this." The middle-aged man tried to slow down and eat, and occasionally picked up the tea and sipped. Take a big mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein simply solved the toast, just watching it quietly, waiting for the other party to finish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call, I have three months, no, I haven’t eaten so much in half a year. In the poor house, the food is just enough." After a while, that The old man put down the spoon and the empty plate in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pretended to be a journalist and asked casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you become a tramp? "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a bad thing, I was originally a pretty good worker, I have a wife, I have two lovely children, one Boy, a girl, but a few years ago, a contagious disease took them away. I also lived in the hospital for a long time, lost my job, lost my wealth, lost my family. From then on, I often could not find a job. I have no money to rent a house, I have no money to eat, I can only wander in different streets and some parks, which makes me weak and harder to find a job..." The middle-aged man was numb with some recollection and sadness. Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a sip of tea and sighed again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can only wait to enter the poor The opportunity of the hospital, but you know, each poor hospital has a number of restrictions, good luck, queued in time, I can take a few days, recover some physical strength, and then find a temporary job, um, temporary Soon, I will lose my job again and repeat the previous process. I don't know how long I can stay like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should have been a good worker. Klein thought, "How many cigarettes do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are not a few." The middle-aged man smiled bitterly. "This is my last possession. The only thing left when I was driven out by the landlord. Oh, I can’t bring them to the poor, I will secretly steal them. Hidden in the gap of the clothes. Only when the most difficult time, I took out one and let myself have a hope, I don’t know how long I can hold on, I will tell you ., But I had a good worker "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Klein is not a professional reporter, it did not know what to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and looked out the window and saw a face with a markedly hungry color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some are still awake, this is the residents of the Eastern District, some numbness is not as tired as humans, this is a tramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no obvious gap between the two, the former is easy to become the latter, such as the gentleman in front of me... Klein turned around and found that The middle-aged man fell asleep and curled up in his chair and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Klein used to wake up and gave him a copper penny:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"This is the interview fee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, ok, thank you, thank you!" The middle-aged man did not return to the moment, waiting for Klein. When he reached the door, he only raised his voice. "I will take a shower at a cheap hotel, take a good sleep, and then find a job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, Klein attended the banquet at the Summer House, and the guests had a total of ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
