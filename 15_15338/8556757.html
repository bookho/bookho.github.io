			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just stepping onto the deck and getting into the cabin in the future, Klein saw a figure through the corner of his eye and walked through the crowd to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was careless on the surface, but inside, but looked at the police with a stern look, and found a 30-year-old man wearing a half-high black hat and a long windbreaker . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party has a face polished by the wind cream, rough but very masculine, light blue eyes without smile, as if depositing many past events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bit familiar... Yes, the guy I met at the ticketing company yesterday seems to be an adventurer too... I was wearing it on the sea in January. It’s a windbreaker, it’s very strong... Klein’s side easily lifts the cane, slanting down and squinting, and smiles and says:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Good morning, we I met again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like greeting an old friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rough man did not feel surprised, stopped, slightly restrained and nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Crivis, former adventurer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Man, are you peers? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you knew it yesterday, Galman Sparo. Klein responded with a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hand the cane to the left palm because he did not intend to shake hands with the other.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be seen. "Crevis has been silent for two seconds. "The adventurer is not a good career. I have changed careers and become a bodyguard. This time I followed my employer's family to the capital of the Rothde Islands. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his body halfway and pointed to another position on the nail plate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein follows Looking around, I saw nearly ten people gathered together. The first one was a gentleman who was a middle-aged blessing. His cheeks were ruddy and his eyes were sacred. The double-breasted long dress can see the gold chain of the pocket watch and the collar of the gemstone. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lady wearing a wide-brimmed hat next to her, her face was completely covered by the dark blue spun yarn that was hanging down, and her figure remained fairly good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two children in front of the two, a small boy, less than 10 years old, wearing a children's version of the dovetail dress, the big ten At the age of five or six, she is a vibrant girl. She looks very special, but a pair of brown pelicans is quite agile. The faint freckles and fluffy pleats add a bit of playfulness to her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are surrounded by suitcases, three people with various items, one man and two women, all dressed as servants, one of whom is brown-red. The obvious Southland race.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven people who protect the above are a man and a woman, dressed in a simple and capable manner, all in white shirts, light sweaters, black coats, Dressed in dark trousers and sturdy leather boots.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two bodyguards did not specifically cover the traces made by the waist gun bag, and did not take a hard look at the traffic Close pedestrians, sharp eyes, calm and temperament.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three servants, three bodyguards? Klein asked casually.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This configuration is quite extravagant, indicating that the employer is a rich man...he is instinctively making judgments.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Krivis bowed his head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer said, quickly turned to the employer’s family.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;......Klein is there, I don’t know what the other person is going to say and say.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminiscence of novels and movies that I have seen in my life. And the TV series, he gradually understood the meaning of Krivis's hidden.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a little bit to me, or someone who claimed to be an adventurer and didn’t look very good Be vigilant, so introduce yourself in advance, show your identity and things to do, let me not hit the idea of ​​his employer’s family. Simply put, you are yours, I am my, and do not infringe each other... This is a sophisticated adventurer. Or the tacit understanding of the senior bounty hunter? A little bit... Klein laughed, carrying a suitcase, holding a black cane, entering the cabin, and finding his own room according to the ticket.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, he pushed open the wooden door and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room is not spacious, just can put a bed and a table, not even a chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest advantage of it is that it has windows, the sun in the harbour shines, and the pure gold spots are sprinkled on the table and the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The crew just said that the bathroom and the bathroom are shared, about eight rooms. If you are too anxious, you can provide a wooden toilet, but you must Paying for the cleaning fee, 3 pence a time... I have to thank you for the renovation of the white agate, the laying of many metal pipes, the burning of boilers, the supply of hot water, providing a relatively convenient lifestyle, otherwise travel is not What a pleasant thing would be..." Kline said a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly took out the necessary items and placed them on the table for daily access. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he sat down on the bedside, listening to the long whistle, feeling the kind of steam and machinery inside. power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vessel began to sail, and Klein saw the seascape outside the window, and gradually regained his thoughts and began to consider the next most important thing, that is, how to play The problem of "no face". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the "real creator" approaching ceremony and the powerful Mr. A, the decision to abandon the escape attempt to destroy makes his potion digest a little, based on this Feedback, he has a new understanding of the role of "faceless people." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'You can pretend to be anyone, but only yourself', this is the code that the 'Secret Master' Rosago was asked to remember...I Originally thought that 'self' refers to the original identity, but now it seems that this is not perfect, what is himself, must really understand ..." Klein leaned forward, bathed in the sun, as if a statue of thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he gradually got the idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does this correspond to its own spirit? , refers to the most true self in the heart?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even at the time of the Earth, Zhou Mingrui has a lot of disguise, thus forming a social personality mask, from In a sense, this has a lot of false components. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well...when I become someone else, I’m replacing them, and in order not to be discovered, I have to do camouflage in relationships, equal Wearing different personality masks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When all personality masks are removed, there are no more remnants, what will the "no face" finally see? Kind of 'self'? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the deep meaning of 'self' in that code?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I Face the inner thoughts, overcome the fears, and do not really challenge yourself if you don’t challenge them for social reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be explored and verified..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein changed his position. In order to sit more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the aftertaste, he found another problem:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When underground ruins I used to pretend to be Inns Zangweier, and I managed to escape the predicament, but why is there no feeling that the potion shows signs of digestion?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to digest the 'no face' potion, is this shallow level of camouflage not enough? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, this is closer to the application of extraordinary ability, not to play!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The ability to promote the digestive of the potion is a deep disguise. Is it really replacing a person and becoming a social person? When his relatives and friends can't find it for a long time, it shows that the disguise is successful?<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, I feel like I'm in harmony with the 'no face' potion because I successfully pretended to be Klein Moretti? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first article of the 'No Faces' Code can pretend to be anyone, but only himself... The second article, the depth of all people Hierarchical disguise?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, replacing a person and becoming a social person is just an imaginary, it is very evil...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
