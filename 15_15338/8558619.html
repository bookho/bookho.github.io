			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windows in the bathroom are high, the sun is not enough, and they can barely dispel the darkness, and everything looks groggy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s right hand with the “probability of ambiguity” just approached the “black eye” and suddenly shook it and threw the grip to the sink. The other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The milky white scorpion rolled a few laps and finally settled to the red at 4 o'clock. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a less obvious smile and took a step forward, picking up the "probability of ambiguity", and bowed his head in a gentle manner:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't seem to want to listen?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way, give me an answer, 6 points for cooperation, the rest Refuse. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he threw up the "probability of the cockroaches" and then grabbed it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The milky white scorpion fell straight and rolled quickly, letting the bright red 6 points face up!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Klein gave a low smile and praised it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After throwing the "All Black Eyes" back on the fog, he turned and opened the door of the bathroom. Step back to the living room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of fat pharmacist Dirkwell and Owl Harry looking forward to worrying and curious and doubtful, he suddenly stopped. Throw out the “probability of the probabilities” in your hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell and the owl scream at the same time, afraid to throw out the result below 3 points, the latter is more subconscious flying, away from the possibility of lightning The fat man in the middle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the crisp touch, the milky white scorpion rolls continuously on the coffee table, which will be fixed at 2 points.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dakwell’s face brush was pale, the scorpion turned lazily and finally turned up at 4 o'clock.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It will be relatively quiet within 12 hours. Klein calmly sat down and began to enjoy his already cold lunch.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His approach is really useful? Dakwell whispered, dead Staring at the strange scorpion on the coffee table.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few tens of seconds, he couldn’t help but reach out and took the initiative to help the scorpion turn over and turn to 6 o’clock. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His palm has just left, the scorpion has no wind and it has returned to 4 o'clock.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s amazing Ah...what did Gilman Sparo use? Did you really pull a bowel movement and dipped the scorpion inside? Vomiting... Dirkwell decided to accept the result, no longer think about the cause, otherwise he doubted himself. I will spit it out on the spot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German Sparo, who looked up and quietly smeared the cream, Dakwell suddenly felt that 1000 pounds and a promise can please It’s really worthwhile to go to this level of bodyguards!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can definitely be called with any pirate general! If a rich man encounters me Kind of thing, take half of his body and ask him not to hesitate... Fortunately, I only paid 300 pounds, and the rest are borne by the teacher... Dakwell thought that within 12 hours, don’t worry about the scorpion rolling, body and mind It was easy, I couldn’t help but stand up and stretched out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the window and pushed open the closed window, only to see the outside air Sparse, tall and wide.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boundless azure gently shakes, reflecting the bright sunshine, like being sprinkled with countless pieces of gold, This made Dakwell's spirit suddenly abrupt, and his heart seemed to be cheerful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Beckland will not be able to warm up at the end of February, the waters of the Rothde Islands have gradually Get rid of the low temperature, all things grow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;facing the sea, the spring blossoms... Klein who eats the bread goes to the side of Dakwell, only to feel this time. I am like an animal that has just woken up from hibernation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not read the poem that flashed in his mind, this is not in line with the people of Galman Sparo, and the second is that the great probability will make Dirkwell feel the poetry talent of Russell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evening, when the scorpion has not turned, the weather has changed, the wind is sweeping, the clouds are cascading, and the storm is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most common danger at sea. Even if you sail on a safe waterway that has been explored by predecessors, you will encounter similar situations from time to time, but it will not be so terrible. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the high waves and the faint sky, and found that the boat seemed to travel in the valley, and the sides were high and might collapse at any time. The dark blue "slip wall". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong sense of oppression made his extraordinary person in the sequence also obviously depressed, even wanting to pray to the gods, hope that the passenger ship can be in this It was safe in the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that sailors, pirates, and businessmen who have lived in the sea for a long time will have a hard time deterring the Lord of the Storm, more or less trusting... Klein secretly Sighed. <br /><br />############################################################################################################## "Poseidon" Cavitowa made a prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was afraid of the storm, the "probability of the cockroach" suddenly broke out, get 1 point, let the ship sink to the bottom of the sea, so simply precautions - Klein did believe that the "Destiny of the Snake" Will Anthony's judgment, I believe that "the probability of ambiguity" will be quiet for about 12 hours after being intimidated for the first time, but this is no other condition. He believes that seals with alive characteristics should be treated as human beings rather than incarnations of rules, and must be guarded against the opportunity of the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the stormy and uneasy Dakwell and the owl, Klein said plainly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to take a break.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You continue to stare at the scorpion, take turns, can't relax. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. After watching the Germans Sparo enter the master bedroom, Dirkwell walked to the coffee table, sat down and stared at the owl to Harry. "What do you think now?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry flew in a circle, shouting:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why am I not Haiyan? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the master bedroom, Klein entered the fog and waved to let the "Poseidon Scepter" fly out of the debris pile.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took this short stick with a blue "gemstone" on top and quickly responded to his own petition.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein did not consume too much spirituality to directly calm the storm, because it was not far from the waters of the Rhodes Islands, so it is so obvious that such exaggerated supernatural phenomena can easily lead to the "sea king" Yann Courtman or the ship's storm in the same field. The priest’s attention, the second is to retain the “power” and guard against the “probability of the probabilities.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing he does is very simple, that is, attaching a layer of An extraordinary effect, let it sail smoothly in the storm during the storm, and will not overturn.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequence 5 and the sequence 6 below the demigod come Say, if you want to do something similar to a passenger ship that can carry hundreds of people, you must prepare for it in advance, arrange an unusually complicated ceremony, and almost eliminate it. It’s only possible to complete it, but in the field of “Poseidon”, everything is easy and simple.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The demigod really has the 'God’ One side..." Klein sighed and threw the scepter back into the heap of debris, and disappeared silently on the fog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next During the time, the ships were ups and downs, high and low, like the fallen leaves in the wind, but no matter how terrible and horrible the surrounding dark blue waves, it did not have any problems, and the smooth and steady came to the end of the storm.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday morning, Beckland, Williams Street.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulswall once again arrived here by horse-drawn carriage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
