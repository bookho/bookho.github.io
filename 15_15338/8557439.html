Daniz almost raised his right hand and rubbed his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His first reaction was that he was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German. Sparo has a hidden smile, and the abnormality of his own captain's eyebrows reminds him that the words just made are true! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...German Sparo is a madman who dares to think! This is one of the seven pirate generals, not the role of "steel" Maviti! Daniz’s pupils shrank and his heart was almost shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t mention the power of Senegal itself, only the big pirates and famous pirates under his command are enough to be daunting – The chief officer, the third officer, and the captains of each ship, each of them can be separated and independently lead a large pirate group! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steel" Maviti brings a combination of Baiyam, there are many in the "Blood Pirates"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qilingus was silent in the Bakerland like a wild dog, mainly because he was not in his own pirate group And "the blood will be above" Senigal is different, rarely leaving his flagship, rarely out of the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you return to Senigol’s own strength, it is extremely terrible. He is mysterious and strange. It is the second only to the four kings on the sea. One of the strong, even the captain, did not dare to say that he must be better than him... The daring of the madman is beyond my imagination, no, he simply does not know fear! The death and replacement of a pirate general is definitely a sensation! Daniz turned one thought after another, but in the end it was strange and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because he thinks that Gilman Sparo is a strong general of the seven generals, and there may be a hidden terrorist organization behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina silently for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know 'Rose School'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I not only know, but also kill their people, grab their magical items... and so on, why should I put myself Described as a bad guy... Klein converges on a smile, and does not move: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have hunt their members."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina is silent again, and Daniz next to him has "What are they talking about?" "What is the Rose School?" "Where am I?" "Who is this dream?" Waiting for thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief silence, "Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" and After the treacherous group of the 'Dusk Lieutenant' broke out, the fleet of Senigal lost its trace. No one knows where they are and must wait patiently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Is this promised? Klein smiled again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't lack this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to contact you ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina looked sideways at Daniz:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He knows how connection. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I? "The Spiritual Ceremony"? Wait a minute, Captain, do you mean that I have to follow the madman Spallo? No! No one knows when this guy will go crazy! Daniz took a clever and hurriedly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, I have left the gold dream 'The number is too long, and there are too many courses! I can't wait to return! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He strives to make his eyes look sincere and fills the thirst for knowledge:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think I can change someone, like 'iron sheet', like 'bucket'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bowed slightly and said nothing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I can't hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Rotherto Dreams' is near the limit..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pirate The skirt is slightly moved, and a step back, the figure quickly fades and turns into a broken light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniel’s follow-up words were stuck in his throat, his right hand stretched out, trying to catch something, but unable to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rosselto Dream"? The emperor’s sense of existence in occult knowledge is also very strong... The full name of “Iceberger Lieutenant” is Edwina Edwards... Edwards... Isn’t this the name of one of the great “Apocalypse Four Knights”? Descendants? However, the tone of "Iceberger Lieutenant" shows that she and the eldest daughter of the eldest daughter, Bernard, are not familiar with each other, and may not even know each other... Klein looked at Daniz, whose expression was completely smashed, and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe one day, I will call you Mr. Wan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Dani I was so scared that I straightened my back and saw that the figure of German Sparrow disappeared directly into my dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I only have sequence 7, but with a bounty of seven or eight thousand pounds, then no matter where I go, it will become the target of others... Daniz Staying in your dreams, the more you think, the more you have a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, Daniz looked at an indigenous dress Man Sparo Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are visiting local forces today, maybe we can find some good things there, huh, they are special materials, food Weapons have a lot of demand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this point, Daniz looked up and down with a few eyes of German Sparrow, and it is rare to find a psychological advantage. Laughter: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are all locals, even with a lot of mixed blood, and they will be found a little abnormally dressed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your wide-leg pants with brown jackets are fine, the inside can't be shirts, the real locals are wearing Tarapa shirts, similar to the sea soul shirts, but the colors are all blue or full White, they don't wear a cap, wear a headscarf or don't wear anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, the obvious Luen person you are there will encounter very serious rejection and hostility, like a wolf mixed into a flock I can't hide my existence..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t fall, he saw that Greman Spalo turned his head and looked at himself, that The deep facial features are soft and soft, and the white skin color is instantly dyed with bronze. In just one action time, the whole person has become an indisputable, uncharacteristic indigenous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Daniz looked dumb, and after a few seconds he laughed casually. "I am the same, I must do a disguise."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your disguise? Ha... Klein took off the cap and sat down on the chair:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What local power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The acquisition of extraordinary materials, food weapons? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, in short, cough, rebel." Daniz is suddenly uncertain whether there is a certain person in the form of German Sparrow and Lun a degree of connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has a heart for a second:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rebel?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz smirked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just shouting independence, the locals who manage local affairs They are in the depths of the jungle, on the sea, and cooperate with many pirates and adventurers. Of course, the main supporters behind them are the Foss, the Intis, and often have 'God of War' and 'Eternal Vigor. 'The missionary sneaked to run here.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently decapitated and did not object to visiting the local forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the "Azure Wind" hotel, Klein led the darkened face of Daniz, wearing a street, all the way to the southeast . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the earliest scope of the "City of the City", they entered a section of architectural style with a pile of piles and a vacant house on the ground floor. There are three or four floors of side-by-side buildings that have evolved from the Luen-style building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roads they separate are narrow and dirty, with a large number of stalls on both sides, selling headwear, earrings, and ornaments made of various stones. Among them, the number of colors with bright red and colorful is the most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a bunch of strange guys, like the bright colors, just like the snakes in the jungle." Daniz whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Intis are not so good, advocating gold, advocating luxury and exquisiteness, the taste of the nouveau riche is overwhelming... Klein’s belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across a bit of a dark-skinned, thin-skinned indigenous, passing through an alley with clothes drying on the top of the head, they suddenly suddenly open and show a A square that is too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the square, a group of locals around the central pool, or bowing, or swearing, or muttering, or singing in a small voice, expression devout but numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as they saw someone approaching, they got up and ran into the alleys around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windows on the second, third and fourth floors of all the houses around the house were closed and the square became quite quiet, but Kline’s inspiration told him that There are many people behind the window, at the corner of the alley, in the dark corner, watching the strangers who suddenly broke into this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz bowed his head and pressed his voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't care, this is them Self-protection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?" Klein expressed his doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi laughed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the colonization, the indigenous people of the Rothde Islands I have always believed in 'Poseidon' Cavitowa, and I believe that the gods who appear in the image of giant sea snakes guard all the islands here, preventing them from being swallowed up by the earthquake and tsunami.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, this belief has been banned on the bright side. The Storm Church has been fighting against the infidels. Even the Night Church and the Steam Church cannot expand their power here. There are only a few churches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But actually, how can these hundreds of thousands of years of faith be so easy to eliminate, Bayam, Blue Mountains, Rothde, still have The believers of the less 'Poseidon', even if they were arrested in a month or two, and subjected to various capital punishments, they could not reverse this situation in a short period of time. The main pillars of those rebel forces are the believers of 'Poseidon'. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I see, at least one hundred years of blows, the belief in 'Poseidon' will disappear completely, of course, without prejudice. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poseidon" Cavitowa...The image is a huge sea snake... Klein listened thoughtfully, followed Daniz into the right front On the side of a four-story house, walk along the narrow stairs to the top floor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚! Daniz rang the door on the left hand side.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who? "There was someone in the low asking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz chuckled and responded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send wine And barbecue friends. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where? The person inside asked a strange question.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz took a step back:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "At sea. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
