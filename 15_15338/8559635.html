			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layers are entangled, as if the pea vines that can weave the steps of heaven have fallen and retracted into the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the master of the "Black Saint" or the good-looking Leo Master, at this time, the trace has been lost, only "the star will be "Cardella stood at the top of the boulder and looked around in the air." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'The mysterious queen' has thrown Leomaster's protagonist and kind personality into his own dreams? Or, to other places , try to figure out where to go to the 'Abandoned Land'?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two personalities seem to be unable to pull into different dreams separately, otherwise,' The mysterious queen has long been able to talk to the kind-hearted Leo Maast alone to help him overcome the demons in exchange for the corresponding information, no need to make such trouble...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Of course, I really want to erase the master of the 'Black Saint", maybe I have to enter the dangerous relic in the real world, even the 'mysterious queen', dare not try it easily, because it is likely to appear 'The evil queen who wants to hurt, likes to hurt'..." Klein thoughtfully turned back and looked at the building near the black monastery gate, only after the clean and bright floor-to-ceiling windows, the same figure belonging to Bernard Has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not try to find the whereabouts of the other party, to know if the "Mysterious Queen" got more information from the kind-hearted Leo Master, because He remembers that the core person of the identity of Gilman Sparo is:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of Mr. Fool! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "the star above" is very clear, in the "fool" Mr. Tarot party, "the sun" comes from the "Ghost of God", the Silver City, To say that Mr. "The Fool" does not know how to enter the "land of God", it is obviously unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as a leader, Gelman Sparo is bound to lack the motivation to delve deeper! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of things are really set and defeated, this is the flaw of "no face"... Kline withdraws his gaze and looks back at the opposite mountain The "Giant Wang Ting" projection, only seeing the condensed dusk there is slowly returning to the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this mountain peak, the boulder still stands, and "the star above" Jia Delia slowly sat down again and hugged his knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noon and night alternate three times, but the actual time has just passed A white day outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Future" bypasses dangerous ruins and ruins, avoids hidden dangers hidden in different locations on the safe waterway, and finally returns to the entrance of this sea area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and others once again saw the first ruins that were flooded by the sea, saw the gray stones and pillars stacked in the peak, and saw the top of the tall Dome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, here they heard a huge and obvious gasping, "bloodless" even more painfully pointed out that the corpse is buried in the ruins! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that corpse is probably the source of breathing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, this ruin with great danger brings to the "Future" everyone is no longer afraid, but joy, because, see it It means that we are about to leave this horrible ocean! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, there is a boat!" Nina did not know when she had climbed the high observatory and looked at the ruins and said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ship? Klein bypassed Anderson Hood, who was in front of him, approaching the ship's side and staring at it. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the stones and the pillars stacked side by side, parked on the side of an ordinary three-masted sailing ship, because there are obstacles to block, not condescending, or carefully Observing, it is difficult for people on the "Future" to find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailboat floats there, there is no sailor on the deck, and it is so quiet that it is inexplicably scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the people who dare to outline the murals of "Destiny Angels" are not qualified to say this sentence... Your treasure hunt is self-satisfied and experienced, and the result is not only one of you... Klein has no sideways and has two words in his belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "Star above" Jia Delia also came to the deck and looked at the sailboat next to the ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole process, she didn't look at Gelman Sparo as if the other person didn't exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief silence, Jia Delia lifted her hand and took off the heavy glasses on the bridge of the nose. The deep purple in the scorpion slowly flowed, seemingly sketching out one after another. A complicated symbol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unmanned sailboat over the sky, suddenly appeared a pair of eyes, illusory translucent deep purple eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes moved slowly, circling the deck and entering the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This extraordinary ability is very useful... Speaking of it, according to the means of 'Mystery Queen' and 'Star above' will show, 'Peeping the Secret' The extraordinary ability is very kind of 'fairy tale' color! Hey, can the 'mysterious queen' turn others into frogs? Also, the 'peeping secret' of 'the glimpse of the secret person' is reflected in this aspect, reflected in the eyes. On the top of the 'stars above' will be a little weird, and later have to pay attention to..." Klein secretly speculated, waiting for Jia Delia's remote exploration to gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the deep purple in the eyes of Jia De Li Ya finally faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rubbed her eyebrows and put on her glasses again, against Anderson Hood, Frank Lidao:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a problem inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, she took out a colored powder from the pocket of the classical wizard’s robe, jerking Throw out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These powders are sloppy and self-contained to form a lifelike color picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The background of the scroll is the place where the captain's room is located, there are photos on the desk, there are portraits on the wall, and the same person is outlined:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Fossarian with a wide shoulder, yellowish hair and blue eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... Klein first felt familiar, and immediately remembered where he had seen each other:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was in Nassis, an adventurer was chased by the second Gilhies of the Undead King, ran into the "Lodal" bar, and sought the help of the members of the "Adventurer Mutual Aid Society". At that moment, stood up. In the strong who provided the blessing, there is such a strong man who is more than two meters tall. The feeling of giving Klein is not weak, probably already has a sequence of 6! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did his ship suddenly enter the waters and slammed into dangerous ruins? Klein wondered, taking a closer look at the supernatural picture on the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he saw a pool of blood on the floor, and there were several Fossic words next to the blood:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;“不老泉...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the word, the blood is abducted and becomes a long trail, and is connected with a marked drag to the door. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s mind seems to have been able to restore the scene at the time, the 6th-century Fossachian man was attacked inexplicably, and suffered serious injuries, trying to write The source of all my encounters, the result just opened the head, I do not know what is carrying the legs or head, and dragged away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that the bloody words were not erased, Klein suspected that it was not a living person who towed away the adventurer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be the body in the ruins...he thought a little bit of a toothache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"‘‘不老泉’? Are they here to look for ‘no old spring’?” Anderson Hood spoke excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Obviously, they didn't find it." Frank Lee shook his head in disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not old spring"... At that time, the young adventurer was chasing the "slayer" Gilshies, who was the second of the "immortal king"... The rumor "the king of immortality" once drank the spring of "not the old spring" ... Gilthias also warned me, warning Galman Sparo, saying that you should not interfere with the young adventurer, saying that this is the will of the "immortal king"... Klein is reluctant according to various information Piece together a truth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young adventurer gets or steals the secret of "No Spring" from a confidant of "The King of Undead", so he is murdered Later, under the blessing of several prospective strongmen of the "Adventurer Mutual Aid Society", they barely got rid of the "slaughter" Gilhies, and then they were on the one hand to avoid the "immortal king" and on the other hand to find "not old spring". ", finally chose to enter this sea area adventure, who knows, in this ruin next to the group ... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it "not old spring" in the depths of this ruin ? Klein once again looked at the gray stones and stone pillars stacked in a peak, and there was a vague speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is difficult to verify the idea for the time being, and it is not clear who the corpse buried in the ruins was, he has no impulse to explore and take risks, and he has regained his sight. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning back, you can ask Will Wessetin or "Magic Mirror" Arrods... Oh, maybe the so-called "not old spring" is that The pus from the decay of the body... Klein was the worst malicious speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the "Stars above" and the singer of the conversation between Anderson and Frank thought: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is because of the search for '不老泉' in danger, I don't think that the owner of the portrait and photo will have enough motivation to leave the correct information to the latecomer before he dies. After all, I can find it here. The big probability is not his family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes sense... I am a monster, I am going to die on the way to treasure, I am about to die, I will not think about it. The person left a hint... Klein shook his head invisibly and couldn’t think of another reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddria looks at the face of Anderson and Frank Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Successful Adventures often stem from detailed intelligence and adequate preparation, which are not available now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice suddenly grows bigger and reverberates in every corner of the ship: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Continue sailing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave this sea! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Captain! Nina on the observatory sipped a drink.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, the violation of common sense and the flight occurred again, but with the preparation of the future No. "The crowd is no longer as embarrassed as when they first arrived. It is easy and simple to spend the thrilling scene of jumping off the cliff and being thrown away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly, "The future The number "falls" on the azure sea, and in the distance is a huge storm that obscures the sky.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the not too far, there is another ship quietly suspended, it It is nearly two hundred meters long, and it is tilted up and down like a crescent moon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sail depicting the black tombstone, Klein’s mind flashed Corresponding nouns: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"death"!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The King of Undead" Agari The flagship!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Kline’s heart is not afraid and fear, but excitement and excitement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The "Mysterious Queen" is on board, And this time there is no need to hide... She added me, Star Admiral, Anderson Hood and "Future" everyone, and had the opportunity to destroy the "Undead King" fleet! The "squirming hunger" food was found. !傀儡的傀儡选了!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the “death number” suddenly turned, and the speed was far away from here. Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run, run... Klein was a bit sluggish for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
