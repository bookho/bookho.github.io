			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the dark blue viscous liquid that was hard to say is a cup or a piece, and swallowed hard:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just drink like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you need any additional preparations? Such as rituals, spells, or prayers?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil "呃" a channel:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare? Yes, you first Come to Intimid's Ormill wine, take a Dixi cigar, and then play a melodious melody, dance a brisk court dance, you can also tap dance, and finally come to the Kunte card..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Klein’s expression is getting more and more dull, Old Neil smiles and gives the summary described above:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you feel nervous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......You are quite humorous... Kline’s mouth twitched twice and held back The impulse to pull the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put his cane and extended his right hand, as if holding a heavy object and holding the opaque cup, the potion smells faint, illusory . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people, don't hesitate, the more hesitant, the more nervous, the more afraid, the more influence the absorption." Old Neil is back to Klein. Said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know when he had reached the sink next to him, unscrewed the faucet, and licked his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded silently, taking a deep breath, just like taking a nose and taking medicine as a child, putting the opaque cup to his mouth, one looking up, Drink it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cool, smooth feeling quickly filled his mouth, then slipped across the esophagus and slipped into the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viscous, dark blue liquid seems to have grown into a thin, long tentacle, and ice and stimuli instantly penetrate every cell of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He involuntarily twitched, his eyes quickly blurred, all colors increased, red was redder, blue was bluer, black was darker, color blocks Rich, patchwork, like the oil paintings of the Impressionist masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene, Klein had experienced before, that is the picture of the "Psychic" Dai Li asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, his vision is blurred, his thoughts are erratic but clear, like a victim floating on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, he saw the surrounding scenes, all the colors overlap each other clearly, and the gray and illusory fog was faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around him, it is difficult to describe the form, even transparent to the seemingly non-existent things, in the depths, there are one after another different colors of clear brilliance These brilliances seem to have life or endless knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit like the "transfer ceremony"... Klein instinctively looks down and finds that "self" is still standing, the body is pumping one Pumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, he has a clear understanding, the consciousness is sinking, and the body is one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog dissipates quickly, the color blocks are normal at the same time, and the bright brilliance and non-existent objects disappear instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene in the alchemy room has returned to normal, but Klein feels that his head is expanding, there is a tendency to be split, and there are countless things to see. Shadow, the ear is coming from the whisper of something unknown:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honakis...Fregra...Honakis...Fo Regra...Honakis...Fregra..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s forehead was stinging, his heart was filled with anger, wanting to ruin The impulse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned and swayed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the line of sight abnormal? And heard the sound that I couldn't hear before?" asked Neil, who was next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Mr. Neil, what should I do?" Kline resisted the intense mania and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is because the power of the potion has overflowed, And you lack control. Well, as I said, imagine an item in your mind, common, simple, and easy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein took note and outlined his half-height black silk hat in his mind, thinking about how it felt and thinking about its specific shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put all your attention on it, repeat it over and over and over, do you feel better?" Old Neil's voice wears Pass through, like a song of peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shifted his attention a little bit to the imaginary silk hat, only to realize that the whisper of the ear gradually became smaller until it disappeared. The ghosting is also slowly overlapping, no longer blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Much better." Klein calmed the mess in his heart and vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down at his body and found no abnormalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After moving hands, Klein was half expecting to ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I succeeded? Is it a 'divination'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil pulled a silver-plated mirror from the side and leaned in front of him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stared at himself, only to see his own black wearing a mirror The top hat, the outline is deep, the facial features are ordinary, except for the sweat on the face, it seems no different from before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully looked at the position of the eye according to the tips of the old Neil, only to find that his original brown scorpion deepened a lot, as if there was no light. The night is as deep as the soul that can absorb others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Normally, dark brown pupils are easily seen as black, and Klein himself is hard to detect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the manifestation of the potion power, when you learn to meditate, know how to converge, your eyes will return to normal." Old Neil smiled and extended his right hand. "Congratulations, new extraordinary, our divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Klein reached out and shook hands, "Mr. Neil, When can I learn meditation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, the initial meditation is quite simple, especially for the extraordinary." Laughing said, "You just sketched the items in your mind to divert attention, and the power of overflowing is actually the first step in meditation. You can do it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Klein closed his eyes and once again depicted the half-height black silk hat on his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His attention seems to be easier to concentrate than ever before. Soon, some miscellaneous thoughts emerged and fell, leaving only the hats that were outlined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the head be slightly empty, then replace the outlined items with items that are not found in the world and that are imaginary out of thin air."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be sure to follow this rule, only then can you enter meditation, only a little bit with the 'I', the infinite 'I', the 'I' of the universe For one, get insights and revelations of truth, and acquire knowledge that can only be realized by oneself. In the field of occultism, this is called 'different experience'.” Old Neil said in a soothing tone, “The description of the latter, you For the time being, I only need to listen to it. The most important thing is to enter meditation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world does not exist, imagined out of thin air... Count? Klein tried to replace the half-height black hat with the earthy, long, thick intercontinental ballistic missiles seen on television. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no matter how it is sketched, how to imagine, he always just concentrates more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t seem to work... Klein had to imagine, sketch a ball of light, and then sketched a lot of similar things and put them together . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light balls overlap, full of fantasy, and Klein's thoughts are gradually empty, seemingly erratic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body and mind are quiet, before the illusion of fog and mixed color that is not covered with objects and clear brilliance, quietly Suspended in the sky, at your fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirituality extends a little bit, and an inch is unfolding. Klein looks down at it quietly, feels it, and embraces it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, it is not a 'divination', the meditation is very smooth, just a little bit worse than I was, a little bit." Old Neil laughed. "In this case, I began to teach you the most common use in the mysterious field, the easiest to master, the most promising ability in the follow-up, and the vision!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will take a look at the gas lamp He closed, but opened the dark door of the alchemy room, so that Klein was in a very dark place, but not even the outline of the object could not be seen clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, continue to the current state, lift your hands up and put them in front of your eyes, but your index fingers are opposite, but don't touch them."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open your eyes until you adapt to the darkness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the description of the old Neil, Klein step by step Finished, I saw the outline of my relative fingers and surrounding objects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should have been lying down and let the body relax completely, but since your meditation works well, then let's continue." Old Neil laughed. Keep the focus of your line of sight behind the hand, you must be behind, then slowly move your fingers to keep them in a state of relative invisibility, and don't let them leave the line of sight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Klein calmly listened, and his eyes fell on the empty position behind the palm of the hand, allowing the two opposite index fingers to move slowly in the line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, twice, three times... Suddenly, Klein saw a red-hot color between his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey..." He made a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See the color? Yes, this is the initial vision, the color you see is your own gas field." Old Neil laughed. "Don't worry, more times, stabilize, and then go to other places, I also take this opportunity to tell you the meaning of different colors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Okay." Klein moved his fingers back and forth, focusing on the ignition red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In simple terms, the mainstream of occultism The non-physical part of each person is divided into four layers, the core of which is called 'spiritual body', which is the most fundamental spirituality of each person. The animist believes that all creatures have spirituality and have spiritual bodies."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Others I don't know, but for voyeurs, the purpose of meditation, the way to improve strength, all point to the 'spiritual body'."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides 'spiritual body' is the 'star spirit', which is the way the former communicates with the spiritual world and the starry sky, belongs to the external manifestation of the former, and is with your own The will is directly related to the current mood... The scene you see after taking the potion is the picture seen by the "Star Spirit" wandering spirit world, where the rules of the material world are not observed, and the 'I' of transcendence is infinite. The 'I', the 'I' of the universe, the past, the present and the future may overlap, which is the root of divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the spiritual world, what you see is only the image, just the symbol, which must be interpreted to understand the specific meaning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Divination and many other magics are carried out through the 'Star Spirit'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The relationship and difference between it and the 'spiritual body' must not be Wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One for the body, one for the use... Klein continued to look at the gas field at the tip of his finger and made a concise summary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Going further, is the 'mental body', starting from here, combined with the flesh... It involves the mind, your reasoning ability, thinking ability, insight The comprehensive presentation of abilities and ability to recognize things, some of the potions are mainly to enhance this, and a lot of magic is also aimed at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neal explains in considerable detail "The outermost layer is the 'Ether Body', which is the expression of your life energy and physical state."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
