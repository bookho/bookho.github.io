			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Received a letter? Doesn't it mean that there is something at home? Walter’s family lives in Beckland. Is there anything really going on directly in the public carriage or in the rental carriage? Isn’t it faster than sending a letter? With his income and the land of the country, he can definitely afford it... Klein seems to just nod his head and ask no more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked back to the easy chair position, sat down, picked up a newspaper, and started reading very seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richardson saw the situation, did not say anything, quietly back out of the room, silently closed the wooden door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sound of the snoring sounded slightly, Klein turned his gaze away from the newspaper and looked at the door, thinking secretly:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found out that Richardson has an advantage. He likes to observe the situation around him and can notice valuable information. Before the Bishop Electra went to the house of Mr. Murray Maht. The first thing that he saw on the balcony...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is different from the audience, the focus is on events, not on details...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter's things are a bit unusual. Is this the extra expansion that Ardodes said? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what, first go to divination, so as not to be harmed and not knowing...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking of this, Klein immediately entered the bathroom of the room, went four steps back to the fog, and every time he was in the state of "fool", the core under his fog was Klein Moretti's. It does not overlap with the images of Sherlock Moriatti, German Sparrow, and Daun Dontes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the lack of necessary information, he can only take care of his own safety, so he did not use the "dream law" to directly remove the wrist of the wrist and write The corresponding divination statement: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Walter's anomaly can be dangerous to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding the left hand and closing his eyes, Klein entered the state of meditation and whispered the words he had just written. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a full seven times, he opened his eyes and looked at the silver chain, only to see the citrine pendant rotating counterclockwise, the amplitude and speed were quite normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that Walter's anomaly will not bring him danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it can only explain this problem, maybe I will encounter troubles without danger... In addition, there is a possibility that danger is not dangerous depending on whether Made a normal choice, if it is rash, it will become dangerous without danger... Klein interprets based on rich experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just put down this thing and suddenly saw the deep red star symbolizing the "hidden" blooming, showing expansion and contraction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "Lucky Balance" payment? Klein had a happy heart, when the spirituality spread to the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the contact, he was disappointed, because "Star above" Jia Delia was only asking Mr. "The Fool" to convey her words to "downside people" I did not mention when the transaction with the "world" was completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 'Abyss whirlpool' in the north of the island of Sunia has the Obonis sea monster? Mr. 'Inverted man' is lucky, at least not like Like me, I must enter the ruins of the gods... Of course, the Obonis sea monster is also very dangerous. It is not so simple to use it to hold a ceremony. Mr. 'down man' may have to ask for help from 'Sea God'... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The request of Ms. 'Hidden' turned out to help find the immediate descendants of the Abraham family... This shows that the 'mysterious queen' is quite clear about the origin of Mr. Gate. ... the emperor told her? "Klein associates with the words of Jia De Li Ya from the top of the star, and throws the corresponding image into the deep red star that represents the "downside down man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Alger Wilson just finished his debrief and passed the assessment and re-boarded the "Blue Avenger".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the room and closing the door, he came to the wine cabinet and took a bottle of pirate's favorite "Lei Lang Qi", opened a beer mug and poured a half cup directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger immediately picked up the glass and put it to his mouth. He drank tons of tons of water, just like it was not a spirit, but a clear water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, his eyes are half closed and seem to be immersed in his own world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After drinking the half cup of "Strong Lang Qi", Alger put down the cup, wiped his mouth, and smiled aloud:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The direct descendants of the Abraham family? This is very difficult for others, there is almost no clue, but I can ask Miss 'Magician', her teacher is... Hehe, above the star Will 'not know this thing yet.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly converged his emotions, took a few steps back and forth, and finally decided to give up the idea and respond calmly to the "hidden" "Cardella's request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the star" will not only let me help, next week at the Tarot meeting, she is likely to release this task to all members, while others I know that the teacher of "Magician" is a member of the Abraham family... It is easy to deceive the things that are not necessary to deceive, and can not be destroyed by the temptation to make small transactions. There are many transactions that may exist afterwards... Sometimes, honesty is the least costly. The way... Alger stopped and respectfully buried his head and mourned the name of Mr. "Foolish Man":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Please tell us 'Ms., for clues about the immediate descendants of the Abraham family, she can directly ask Miss 'Magician'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respond to the "Star Over" replacement request After the incident, Alger took the initiative to mention his own experience in the "Blood Moon Night", asked Mr. "Footer", whether it is the "Book of Natural Disasters" that resonates with the extraordinary characteristics of "Ocean Singers", the dreamland Is the woman holding a gold wine glass in the Coral Palace? Xi Namu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still such things? The "Queen of Natural Disasters" is really dead and not stiff... It should be that he himself has divided the extraordinary characteristics, and some of them have been made into the book of Scourge, and some of them have remained in the remains of the sea. Well, maybe there are third and fourth. Part, but don't know where... After the "downside down" is finished, Klein will undoubtedly determine that the elf that the other person dreamed of is "Queen of Natural Disasters" Gao Shinam! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an intuition, but an inferred basis: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has ever received the Elves Queen Hillam’s favorite gold goblet, and dreams have similar utensils;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singer Haratas knows some details about the life of the "Queen of the Scourge" It has a very low sentiment to the angel, indicating that her high probability is the elf around Gao Shinam. The extraordinary characteristics of her legacy and the "Book of Natural Disasters" resonate in the "Blood Moon Night" is completely understandable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein suddenly remembered one thing, that is, he handed Gao Shinham’s favorite gold goblet to “Iceberg Lieutenant "A De Wenna, let the other person put this utensil into the grave of Xiatashi." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the "Queen of Natural Disasters" really has not completely died, will there be some change in the burial of the gold chalice and the elf corpse around her? Klein was busy calculating the time and found that he was not sure if the "Golden Dream" had sailed to the island of Sunia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly thinking, he responded calmly and calmly to the "downside down":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he “delivered” the words in front of the other party to the deep red star that symbolizes the “hidden” Jia Delia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Klein has the "world" of German Sparrow, let him pray:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr.'s great 'fool', please tell Daniz, let him ask about the abnormality of the elf singer Shattrath's corpse and the gold goblet. 'Iceberg Lieutenant' Edwin Na. Edwards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein, who finished the operation, vomited and threw the corresponding image into the specially marked prayer spot. Then go back to the real world and get out of the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
