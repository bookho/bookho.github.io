			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West End, Green Park Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who has a lighter beard around his mouth, wearing gold-rimmed glasses, a half-high hat and a black cane, followed by Loko Carman On the side of the body, enter the spacious and bright living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge crystal lamp hanging from the ceiling. The walls, corners and table tops are decorated with various golden reliefs and ornaments. The overall look is gorgeous and exquisite. ,luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a jeweler, a jeweler living in the West End..." Kline swept through the paintings next to him and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After every step of Logo, the fat on his body will shake, and people will always guess maliciously when his clothes and pants will break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But obviously, as a jeweler, he has enough money to buy the best quality clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Detective Moriarty, this is my child, Attleu." Luo Ge stopped at the edge of the carpet and pointed to sitting on a single couch. The fifteen or six-year-old boy said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because every fireplace in the house has been ignited and there is a metal pipe to transfer heat, the living room is quite warm, so Klein wants to get off There was only one shirt and one pair of trousers, but the boy was wrapped in a thick fur coat and covered with a blanket that looked very hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he is lowering his head, hugged himself tightly, constantly shaking, and the dark blue hair seems to have lost its luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logo glanced anxiously and whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yatru, This is the detective of Moriarty who is responsible for protecting you today and tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this sentence, Yatru raised his head and revealed a pale face. Holes, blue lips, and eyes without focus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Protect me, protect me...they want to kill me! They want to kill me!" His voice became more and more sharp, and at the end, he used it. Cover your ears with your hands and shout loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, he gradually calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, Klein has scorned his teeth and quietly turned on the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咦... He resisted the strangeness of his mouth, and carefully examined his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the color of Yatru’s gas field dyed with dark black and green luster! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a representation of a ghostly ghost, even a possession! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ytra's bad friends are already retaliating against him...or, there is no such thing as a bad friend, he has a grievance, an illusion... Ryan quietly reached out and took Mr. Azick's copper whistle and spread the spirit. Then he thoughtfully removed his gaze and looked at the other people in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the position of the convex belly window, standing in the man wearing a black jacket, he is tall and sturdy, not screaming, his waist is bulging, it seems to be hiding a pistol . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be one of the six security guards... Klein is about to look at another person, Logo Carman has introduced:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Castella Detective, her assistant Lydia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stuart Detective." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Luo Ge turned his body and pointed to Klein Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The position is Sherlock. Moriarty Detective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caslana, in her thirties, with dark blue eyes and thick eyebrows, when she was young It seems to be a good beauty, but now it seems to be not very good because of the slight sagging of the cheek muscles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of the ladies wore clothes similar to the aristocratic rider's suits, and the white shirts with waists were fitted with more sleek and easy-to-action trousers, only the pleated shape of the collar of the garment was different from that of men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, they left the two left wheels at their waists without any cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds Klein of the words of Jurgen’s lawyer, that is, for private detectives, illegal guns are a matter of check-- It is difficult to obtain the use of a full-class weapon, not a nobleman, not a member of parliament, or a senior government employee. It is difficult to apply for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart sits opposite Kaslana and Lydia, with no flesh on his face, but with a large beard, the light green eyes眸 There is an abnormality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Lydia should be about the same age, taller than Klein, 1 meter and 7 years old, weighing 140 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart has a kneeling gun bag with a specially made revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After asking each other awkwardly, Klein took off his coat, took off his hat, and handed it to the maidservant next to him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Place some important items in the place I can get quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he already has paper People, notes, spells, matchboxes, etc. are transferred to the trouser pocket, which has only herbal powder, pure essence and wallet keys, and the 206-pound banknote in the wallet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart sat there, looking at Klein aside, hehe smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You didn't bring a gun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gun? This is my gun." Klein raised his cane with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he sang the gang and simulated the pronunciation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gunshot rang out, Stuart didn’t want to roll forward, Caslana and Lydia quickly left the couch. They each found a place to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logo and the servant next to him were astonished and confused. They didn’t understand what was going on. Yatru still had a low head and shivered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you see that Klein is holding a black cane in his hand and knows that nothing has happened, Kaslana and other talents are calm and frowning. Asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened just now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since I got a pistol Turning in, I am learning the skills of simulating vocalization, it looks good." Klein answered half-jokingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not an interesting thing, detective Moriarty." Kaslana said in a cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to show you the magic... Klein spoke a word and handed the cane to the maid, Zheng’s focus:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will pay attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most embarrassing Stuart just did not have any angry performance, took it with great interest. When I took the clothes, I got up and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moriarty, why haven’t I heard of you? I mean, I don’t know in the detective line. There are few people, but I didn't know you before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came to Beckland in early September." Klein explained a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way..." Stuart laughed. "Tonight we are a group of two, responsible for the morning to tomorrow morning, no problem?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Klein responded with the same smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, wait until dinner, you go to rest, then rotate in the early hours." Kaslana added a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing happened throughout the afternoon, worried wagons prepared a sumptuous dinner for the detective and security personnel, but no alcohol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having enough to eat, Klein and Stuart, the young man with a slap in the face, went to their second floor room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing no one in sight, Stuart shook his head and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sherlock, you should have seen it. The question of Atru is not someone to retaliate against him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother, you are very familiar... Klein The expression does not change and asks: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He looks like There is a problem with the spirit, or, or, according to the country, it is entangled by ghosts and evil spirits. Frankly speaking, I am afraid of this.” Stuart sighed. “Mr. Caroman should take him to see. Psychologists, if they are not used, look for the priest of the storm master, let them sprinkle holy water, and do the ritual!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can make this suggestion to him. Klein said in a fair way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After two days, if Atru has not improved, I will consider it." Stuart looked at Klein sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is your business, I will end the commission tomorrow. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the two arrived at their destination and entered their rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 1 am, in the bedroom of Atru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat in the rocking chair, holding the Azick copper whistle, quietly watching the protected, Stuart drinking coffee at the desk . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two did not speak, afraid to wake up to Attleu who could not sleep easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, and there is a sudden coldness in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attruho sat up and opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Stuart asked a little nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, washroom..." Yatru whispered in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face seems paler and his lips are more blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart just wanted to speak, and saw Sherlock. Moriarty stood up and bowed to himself:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I followed him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Stuart sighed in relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein put his hands in his pocket and walked behind Arturo's side step by step, following him to the door of the bathroom outside the two rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yatru just had to close the door and suddenly saw a figure flashing in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't let you out of my sight. Oh, what do you do, when I don't exist." Klein smiled and leaned against the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yatru remained silent, his eyes swept away without a focal length, and looked at the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He unscrewed the faucet and let the water flow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein pulled out a box of matches and ignited one, seemingly wanting to smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
