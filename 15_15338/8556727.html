			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another exchange, "Sun" Dairik suddenly raised a problem:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Mr. Fool, what gesture should we use when we usually thank you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gesture? Klein was temporarily tested by the little "sun". <br /><br />#################################################################################################### <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the last bottom line of a false god...he spit in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See "Mr. Fool" Mr. gaze but not speak, as if waiting for himself to play, "justice" Audrey has a lot of inspiration, think of it in parallel New question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks around in a circle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, do we also design one at the same time?" The hidden movements that indicate their identity? We Tarot will not have many members now, and we don’t need to worry about each other on the same occasion. We will become hostile parties for various reasons, but it will be difficult to avoid in the future. We need a special set. '暗号' to distinguish who is a friend who is an enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This I have an idea... Klein remembered the secret gestures that he had known in his life, such as , 揣手礼. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just wanted to manipulate the "world" to make a suggestion, but "downside down" but spoke:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, Miss Justice, I don't think this is a good idea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compared with other hidden organizations, our Tarot will be the most significant One of the characteristics is that members do not know each other. Even, the amount, I give the most extreme example. Even if one of our members is arrested and tortured, it will not affect other people unless anyone can fight the 'fool'. Sir, go directly here, and this is obviously impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Once you have the whole set of 'ciphers' and 'passwords', the traitor's betrayal will allow hostile forces to use these methods to fish us one by one. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are eager to show off the identity of your Tarot Club members to others? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Audrey was unable to refute for a short time and could only swear, "But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation you are worried about makes sense, but it can be circumvented by weekly fixed exchanges, ad hoc gestures designed in advance, and praying to Mr. Fool's. "After hanging people" Alje considers that the other party is about to provide a large number of gold pounds, and the tone gradually becomes harmonious.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey has a clear understanding Asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The simplest example is to know in advance the possibility of meeting or even colliding with a member at the Tarot party on Monday, so design A set of temporary gestures to indicate each other's identity, and when the matter passes, immediately abolish the set of gestures. Hey, if there is an unexpected situation, there is no time to communicate, and there is some doubt, you can find an opportunity to pray to Mr. Fool’s to confirm whether Are there other members involved? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is roughly the case. "Alger breathed a sigh of relief.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "Sun" Dairik also stunned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Sorry, I asked a stupid question, 'Mr. Fool' never mentioned what gesture to use when thanking Him, that is, worrying about our exposure. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately looked to the top of the bronze table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your will is us path of. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just thought of a special gesture... Klein chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Good. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today's party is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow your wishes!" All members except "Moon" get up at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin took a second to hurriedly stand up and learn to salute other members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a deep red glow in front of his eyes, and his body had a slight drop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his sight returned to normal and he saw the big and small dolls in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Until this time, Emlin White was calming down and recalling the first Tarot party he attended:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides Mr. 'Footer', the strength of other members will not be too strong. Is it like me, being chosen for various reasons? I have ancestors behind them, who are behind them? ?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s ridiculous, I thought at first that the 'Sun' is a semi-god-powerful, just got rid of an angel’s pursuit, who knows, he Only sequence 8, is seeking promotion sequence 7! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A child who is not polite, certainly not yet adult! However, the silver city he has mentioned and the experience of cycling all the time are very weird, I have to look for opportunities. Ask the adults of Nibes, no, first ask Kasimi, and my father and mother, to see if they know Silver City, hey, the historical documents of Silver City dare to tamper with the story of our blood family!<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Miss 'Justice' is a Becklander, very rich and rich, is the daughter of a big banker, or a son of a big aristocrat? Maybe she is a banker, a nobleman...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Magician sees my eyes very strange, must admire the noble blood family, what she said Not much, I didn’t reveal my own information, um, it’s a quiet girl.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mr. hangman” is a mature gentleman, knows a lot, character Very noble, willing to answer questions for new members, and provide corresponding help and information. It can be seen that he is very popular. Both 'Sun' and 'World' are willing to ask him or ask him for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'The World' is a less-loving guy. When you talk, it’s like a mouthful in your throat, you can’t spit it out, such a person, I’m all I don't bother to drink his blood, there is a dirty smell... He is very lonely, very good at hiding his emotions, and can easily come up with the extraordinary characteristics of Sequence 6, and promise to provide one in two months' The psychiatrist's extraordinary characteristics...very powerful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of details flashed, Emlin found that Tarot would be simple and not simple, and "Mr." There is not much progress in intervening in the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He seems to be only interested in the so-called Russell Diary... but He is willing to provide members with miraculous convenience." Lin is not conscious of the identity of the "moon". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking around the doll in the room, he recalled his question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The 'relics' of 4,000 to 5,000 pounds, the hope of becoming a baron in a short time, really makes me embarrassed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, Emlin has not yet Making the final decision, but feeling that the room has become more gloomy, feeling that he has been carrying heavy debts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, in the ancient palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein held the side of the temple with his right thumb and middle finger, and gently rubbed it twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a quiet and silent environment, he quickly sat down and let a small badge fly out of the debris pile and fell to the bronze long table in front of him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badge is only the size of the eye, and the surface symbolizes "destiny" and "hidden", which was what Klein originally found from Llanus. Relics, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is engraved with the inscription of "Holding this thing, you can join" and provides the corresponding gathering information:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that Klein needs to consider now is whether he will take this badge to the Babul Valley to try his luck tomorrow night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, his heart is inclined to not go, even if he has been promoted to "no face", he can do quite perfect camouflage, he is not too I want to take risks because he doesn't know anything about that party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician does not perform unprepared performances... Klein whispers, licking a gold coin, sandwiched between two fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the badge with the other hand and whispered to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Participating in a party in the Babur Valley is risky.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several times, he slammed a gold coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold coin rolled down and stood upright in his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This indicates that the divination failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough..." Klein was not surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a problem with insufficient pre-information, but it is not at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat there silently, only the gold coins rolled over between the fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Klein defeated curiosity and adventurous spirit and decided not to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this does not mean that I can't mix this thing, tomorrow at 8 o'clock, um..." He outlined his mouth, smiled and returned to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;January 4, 10:35 am. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stood in front of the mahogany wooden table and picked up a stack of banknotes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stack of banknotes has 5 denominations of 10 pounds and 10 denominations of 5 pounds, for a total of 100 pounds. Way to pay for the payment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 15 gold pounds made Klein's wallet full, and he finally managed to buy the ticket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting the wallet, he took the thin leather gloves on the table and put it on his left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main feature of "wful hunger" is that it has a camouflage effect when it is not used, and will not be detected by most extraordinary means, so Klein can make It switches between the original look, the gloves of various colors, and the camouflaged skin. This time, he chose black gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, Klein also prepared a separate right side black glove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he put the brown "biotoxin bottle" into the iron box, blocked with a spiritual wall, and stuffed into the inside pocket of the clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the "sun brooch", as long as it is worn, it will create a hot summer-like feeling. Klein has to put it in an iron cigarette case. , hidden in the bottom of the luggage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"9 Purifying Bullets, 15 Hunting Bullets, 3 Exorcism Bullets..." Klein took out the revolver and put the bullet in the box, while silently Fill it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed the wheel, put the pistol into the armpit gun bag, then put on a black coat, put on a half-height silk hat, lifted the cane and skin The box went out of the hotel room door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the "All Black Eyes" and other unusable items still above the fog, he was fully armed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the carriage, Klein arrived at the "Plitz Port Ticketing Company" in the White Rose District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This company is located in a rather old three-story building with wooden signs posted on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
