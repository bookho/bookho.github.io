			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After crossing the body and avoiding a rampage of drunkards, Emlin frowned and played his clothes and continued to squeeze into the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, he seems to have done nothing, but always can not let the surrounding alcoholic people touch him, regardless of speed, agility, or The balance and coordination of the body have reached a rather terrible level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Emlin came to the bar position and knocked on the board:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender glanced at him and said nothing, continued to duck down the glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Emlin was in the same place, feeling that he should have done something wrong, and he did not get the expected answer, which made him a little angry and angry. I want to go forward and pick up the bartender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he thinks that this is a gentleman’s demeanor, forcing his emotions, watching his eyes and finding that everyone is drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Emlin experimented with the opening:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A glass of Olmer Red Wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action of the bartender wipes the glass, lifts his head, looks at the handsome black man in front of him with a weird look:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the world's top red wine, the price is amazing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin is not stupid, from the other’s eyes, he realizes that he has ordered the wine that he should not have, and carefully recalled the following:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A cup of Southwell beer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"5 pence." The bartender finally put the cup and the rag down. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin directly took out 1 Sule's banknotes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to change. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." The bartender pointed to the left side, "Ian is in the No. 1 card room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlinton sketched a smile and was happy and proud that he had solved a substantial problem. He did not go to the cup of Nanwell beer and turned directly to the No. 1 card room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚! He knocked the door very politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please come in." A slightly loud voice came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin took the collar and pushed the door in and found that the scene was not exactly the same as he expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he wants to come, since it is a card room, there must be a bunch of people around the long table, playing with Texas and other projects, who knows that there are seven or eight people. There was no poker, and every participant had a blank sheet of paper in front of him, and he didn’t know what was recorded. Apart from this, there were only pens and multifaceted scorpions on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin intuitively turned his attention to the youngest one in it, a handsome boy with the same red eyes, only ten Five or six years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ian?" Emlin confirmed as the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian nodded and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this gentleman, what are you doing? Or do you want to join us in this game?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Game?” Emlin instinctively asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian Hehe laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the game, I don't like playing cards, I don't like billiards, but staying here every day, I have to find something to do. I found inspiration from the biography of Russell the Great, that is, to organize some people, sit together and try the paper adventure.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this game, as long as you follow the rules, you can be anyone, a doctor, an adventurer who likes to eat vegetables, a private detective who always carries a wrench and a pipe, or an archaeology that loves whimsy. Home, then go to an old castle together, look for stories hidden in history, and fight with all kinds of monsters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds a bit interesting. "Emlin feels that this kind of game is very suitable for himself." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, do you want to participate? We are involved in a conspiracy this time, will face a powerful ancient vampire, he seems to have a handsome face But under the skin is all the pustules that burned in the blood." Ian warmly invited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood, thank you! Emlin's face twitched invisibly, directly saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have something to entrust you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well... let's go to the room next door." Ian stood up with his dome hat and old bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next door is the billiard room, and no one is inside. The well-behaved and sophisticated boy closes the door. After reviewing it, look at Emlin Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., I don't know you, don't know who introduced you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Emlin slightly lifted his chin and smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock. Moriarty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice just fell, suddenly looked around, raised his hand and pinched his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out to be the detective of Moriarty." Ian sighed with no disguise. "I will be relieved, yes, he is not going." Did Dixi Bay get a vacation? When did you come back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin put down his right hand and said the same expression:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He didn't come back, I went to the place where he rented him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frankly, normal vacation in January It should be finished in the middle and late, and it is now April. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He, will there be any accidents? Ian asked with some concern.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin thought about the ability and mystery of Sherlock Moriatti’s expression and shook his head. Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe just involved in a complicated case. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian didn't say more, and instead asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I call?" you? What commission do you have? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You call me Mr. White." "Emlin took out a paper path like a wanted order," help me find these five people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian took the past and looked through it carefully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A valid clue 20 pounds, the position is 150 pounds, is it acceptable? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem. "Emlin thinks this price is simply too cheap.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with this, his offer at the Tarot meeting is too exaggerated.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian folded the paper and finally asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. White, if there is a clue, where to go Looking for you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bridge South District, Harvest Church. "Emlin has already thought of the answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian heard a few words and looked at him in amazement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a believer in the 'Goddess of the Earth'? This is rare in Beckland. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! Emlin shook his head firmly. "I just volunteered there." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for Ian to speak, he asked first: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is your red eye inherited?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;When I saw Ian, he wanted to ask this question, because in the old age, red eyes belonged to the characteristics of the blood family, but in the Quaternary, humans and blood families had a long mixed life. All belonged to the inhabitants of the empire. Therefore, with a wide range of friendships, many descendants were born, and the "hybrids" with bright red eyes gradually increased, and they were inherited from generation to generation, becoming one of the most common twilights in human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, every red-eyed human ancestor has a blood family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian replied with some scorn: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My father...and go up to me I don't know, because I am a street child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't seem to belong to the kind that is also associated with the blood family... Emlino is disappointed I gave 20 pounds in advance and turned and left the billiard room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he stayed away, Ian did not immediately return to the card room, but closed the door again and opened the air:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Detector Moriarty has not returned to Beckland, I am a bit worried about him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The billiard room suddenly A figure emerged, her pale face, exquisite appearance, wearing a black compact bonnet, wearing the same Gothic style court dress, is the "resent" Sharon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is doing very well." Sharon replied with no emotions, and his figure disappeared and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every time you say that, you have been communicating with detective Moriarty..." Ian whispered and picked up the corner of the billiard room. The newspaper that was placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top is the Tassok newspaper, which is pressed against Sea News, which originally reported on the different colonies of the Kingdom of Lun. What happened at sea and the sea, but because of the current technological conditions, the sea news that passed to Bakerland has been seriously outdated, and it is of little use to those in need, so the sales are not good and the worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the new editor-in-chief, the style of the newspaper has changed, there have been many rumors on the sea, and various strange deeds about pirates about adventurers. It looks more like a compilation of stories than a news report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, this style is quite popular, especially for content involving ghosts, ghosts, sea monsters and treasures. The minority of words is the first choice for most illiterate bragging. After all, although it looks fake, it is interesting enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian arbitrarily flipped through the newspapers and found no content to be aware of. It was only impressive about a report in Maritime News:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is reported that on the evening of March 25, the fleet of 'The King of Undead' attacked a ship that returned to Fossac from East Byron and robbed all the goods and money. And the 'slaughter' Gilhies completed a bloody 'burial' like his title..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These pirates are really arrogant... ... Ian shook his head, put down the newspaper, returned to the card room and continued his game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the bar, Emlin boarded the carriage and leaned against the wall, watching the streetlight slowly receding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squeezed his nose again and silently said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One" '?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ian this weapon businessman really has a lot of channels...good! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin immediately closed his eyes and had more expectations for his commission.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun outside the window shines and the captain's room is dyed golden.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Edwina sat in the chair, holding the book, looking to the opposite side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, you also think Solomon, Tudor, Terence The three great empires have coexisted? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
