			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Klein and Frye’s guess, Leonard pulled the shirt collar and walked back and forth a few steps:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then it is necessary to investigate all the people that Sols has contacted in the almshouse, and everyone he met after he was evicted from the house. This is very troublesome... Let’s take the time to split up. Do a check here, then go straight to the third death in the West End and hand over the rest to the police."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein Answer without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frye had no objections and turned to the poor who slept near Sols last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was about to find another goal, and suddenly saw Leonard give himself a look and used his chin to point to the side hall of the almshouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean? He was confused and did nothing happening. He turned around the hall for half a lap, and then Frye did not pay attention, followed Leonard's footsteps, entered the side hall, and passed the partition to the corner of the secluded no man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a guess." Leonard stopped in front of the broken glass window and suddenly and directly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked around with a puzzled look: "What guess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Green 眸 deeply asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is no extraordinary factor, what do you think Mrs. Lauves will end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it, quite a bit heavy: "The same ending, but will be delayed for a week, two weeks, or a month, for their family, not When you can't support it, you will definitely not go to the doctor, and if the heart disease becomes serious, death will come at any time and there will be no room for salvation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What about Sauls? If he is not taught, what kind of ending will he have?" Leonard asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein considers the opening:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the introduction of the information, Sols early I am full of grievances against bankruptcy, and I am very resentful of not being rescued. I think he will retaliate sooner or later, but the object will not be the reliefee, but the boss of the company who caused him to go bankrupt, and the bank staff who took his house."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What will happen after he retaliates?" Leonard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no doubt that he has intended to terminate his life, and he will die regardless of the success of retaliation." Klein gave a positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard's slightly dagger, revealing a signature frivolous smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then can I Say, Mrs. Lawrence and Thors are both destined to die in the near future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is the "knowledge" keyboard. Immediately after hearing this question, there was speculation: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean that their death was artificially advanced by extraordinary factors? Why is this?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More accurately, the 'life' that they should have was artificially shortened by extraordinary factors, stolen away, and 'life' has been summoned The evil spirits, the devil, the best material for the terrible curse." Leonard's mouth slightly corrected Klein's guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Summon evil spirits, demons, and make a terrible curse..." Klein stared at each other's green eyes, half of which was questioning and speculating, "You seem Very sure? But our survey sample has only two..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard smiled cynically: "Klein, we don't Need to pretend, I have seen you get rid of the seal '2-049' control, know your special, and you should also blur the feeling that I am different from the general extraordinary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He converges on a smile and meets Klein's gaze:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world has a long history. There are such magical items in one way or another. There will always be people who get them, master them, and become the protagonists of different dramas. There are not many people like this, but certainly not only one or two." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think that the extraordinary person who hides the secret must be a bad guy, a villain. I don't think I have to figure out what their special origins are, why? ... As long as your behavior does not harm me, endangering the night and the entire city of Tingen, then you are still my teammate. Similarly, I hope that you will treat me with a similar attitude. Of course, this kind of thing is best. Still don't tell the people above, those guys are old-fashioned and conservative, and always think that our special person will inevitably get out of control, and will inevitably be tempted by the evil spirits demon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; However, my secret is probably more than you think... Klein silently said something, calmly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really do Attitude, just look at your line And purpose, don't care about your speciality, don't try to spy on your secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After saying this, he silently added: No, actually I still More concerned, quite curious, but can only be patient, ah, Leonard feels that he is the protagonist of a drama? What adventure did he get and what kind of magical items he had? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard unbuttoned the shirt collar and chuckled and nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We reached a consensus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In those adventure novels, this is where the two protagonists meet, and the wheels of history begin to roll forward."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't face! Klein smiled perfunctorily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly knows that "the wheel of history is starting to roll forward" from Russell the Great...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; At this time, Leonard slammed two laps, the green eyes were bright, and the corners of the mouth outlined:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I confess, I There is no small grasp that the protagonists of these deaths should die in three months, but they have been advanced to the last two weeks by various means, and the purpose of the other party is to summon evil spirits, demons, or a terrible , a wide-ranging curse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the person who has died of death die early, it is easy to cover up the past and will not quickly attract the attention of the police department. Will not be destroyed in the preparation stage by the night, the punisher and the heart of the machinery..." Klein whispered to himself, analyzing the thoughts behind the scenes. Nade laughed and said: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, if there are healthy, normal people who suddenly die inexplicably, as long as more than three, they will definitely be detained. , will be routinely investigated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So how do we find the altar for the ceremony? Whether it is summoning evil spirits, demons, or making terrible curses All need an altar, a ritual is needed, and those 'life' that are harvested in advance must be stored in a similar place.” Klein believed in the other side. After all, he did not find any other clues and could not make another judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try it and it won't be! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard sneered two channels: "Klein, shouldn't this be your area of ​​expertise? Can't you imagine a ceremonial altar? What kind of situation will it be around?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Klein’s answer, he prefaced: “The atmosphere of death is rich, with the altar as the center of the ball, radius In the range of 10 meters, in addition to the ceremonial host, there will be no living creatures... The surrounding temperature is at least 5 degrees Celsius lower than normal, and there is a cold wind blowing... The altar is sealed by the spiritual wall. And Mrs. Lauves and others were taken away from the 'life'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, he looked at Klein and joked: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that you will be able to divinate where the altars with these characteristics are located."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Ryan frowned slightly and replied in a loud voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as it does not go beyond the city of Tingen, in addition, I need an absolutely quiet, no one to fight . & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp environment, such as my family, ah, but also his wife Laowei Si et al belongings "<br <br /> & nbsp />;</div>
