			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hill outside Baiyam, a forest lost all its vitality and was buried in the collapsed rock wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall, burly, middle-aged man with dark blue hair is wearing a storm priest's gown, standing in the air, looking down on the bottom, with obvious anger in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the Cardinal of the Storm Church, Archbishop of Rothde, the senior deacon of the "Penalty", "Sea King" Yann Courtman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there is still a picture of the battle just in the mind of Courtman, bearing in mind the exit of each participant:<br /><br /> The angel of the rose school used some method to pass power from far away. After the failure of the purpose, he easily took away the seriously injured companion. No one wants to let him Leaving, except for the weird monster that didn’t know where it came from, Yann Courtman remembered very clearly that when the angel retracted his arm, the dark and sticky surface had one more white and one thin white. Feathers, they grow from the top of their heads, from the three-dimensional eyes, from all kinds of imaginable places, and all this is only from the rose school of the angel who escaped the "real creator" atmosphere. Gloves, with a little strength to smash a seemingly ordinary copper whistle;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange and strange spiritual creatures entangled the angel for a while and then retired Deep in the spiritual world, Ian Courtman can't catch up;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;Opening the door of the Aurora to the Holy One, did not participate in the battle, after a spectator spectator for a while, picked up the glove with the "real creator" breath, grab the reopen before the end of the battle" The door "goes away;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange monster from the copper whistle does not have a fixed form, just like the evolution of death itself, He is like a fog, filled with all around, but But there are many white feathers with yellowish smudges. His goal is very clear. It is the angel of the rose school. After the other party fled, he also disappeared into the scene. It seems to be chasing each other, but even then, Yann Courtman, who took the seal from the city and flew to this area, still instinctively felt unwell, just as he was on his long journey to death, and suddenly moved forward a long time;<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only one who was not divine had escaped from the area before Yann Courtman arrived and could not be found later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Yann Courtman recognized him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An adventurer who can kill the sequence 5 "Desire Apostles" is qualified to have his own material on the table of "Sea King"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is a less valued one, but Ian Courtman who has experienced the sequence of "voyagers" still remembers the corresponding content. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze to the cliff, looking down at the waves that hit the island below, whispering a name:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German Sparo!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unknown on the desert island of which sea area, Klein and Azick figured quickly on the edge of the beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is about to speak, wearing a dress and a hat-colored bronze Azick brown sly, deep and deep, as if connected to a dark and dark world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed his right hand, and the white feathers with incomplete roots all flew out, huddled and fell into his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick just a light grip, these weird feathers disappeared and seemed to be the food of the dead world in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Azick, this is the bronze whistle of the spiritual group!" Klein first pointed out the facts before explaining in detail, " At that time, the situation was somewhat critical. In order to make the situation more chaotic, I blew the copper whistle and gave the corresponding feathers to the messenger. Then, there was the same feeling of the fall of the underworld. I did not stop and quickly left the scene. But these feathers still grow on the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft-hearted Azick gently sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It should not be a normal high sequence of extraordinary people, I suspect it is a side product of the Spiritual Religion's artificial death plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way...so succeeded in dragging The angel of the rose school? Klein was fortunate enough to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick took a look around and continued:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still have things to do busy This will make me wake up more memories.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When it is over, I will come back to you to get the ring left by the ancient god of death, my The hunch tells me that it might let me go to a raging sea, or the Southland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You'd better go to a big city like Beckland and Trier. In those places, the strength of the Rose School can be very limited. Intentional action, of course, the best choice is the headquarters of the major churches such as Passo, but this will bring additional risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick Finally, a joke was made, just like a normal Lun gentleman. This life experience seems to imprint the deepest on him, no matter how much memory is restored, there are obvious traces left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of retaining memories, decades of time have little influence on the years of the millennium, starting from the state of forgetting everything, two or three Ten years is enough to reshape a person... When Mr. Azko completely restores his memory, will his different experiences lead to different personalities? It’s really an esoteric question. After that, I’ll let Miss Zhengyi think about it and “request” to the psychological alchemy club... In addition to Klein’s association, see Mr. Azke’s lack of insight into his own conflicts with the Rose School. In a sigh of relief, he asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Azick, what do you know about the 'desire mother tree'?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azke shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before I saw the letter you sent, I didn't even know his existence." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not know "desire mother tree"? Klein snorted and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the 'Bounded God'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Azick shook his head again and sighed and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In ancient times, He or He may have another name."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, at the end of the Quaternary, Mr. Azick began the life cycle of losing memories and retrieving memories. He has been "wandering" in the northern continent, and the rose school was born in the first The southern part of the early Five Kingdoms... Klein nodded, no more questions, and Azick was still busy, and after two more sentences, he took him to the spiritual world again and continued to the east coast of the northern continent. Somewhere, he was thrown to the beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Mr. Azick has gone, Klein has been watching the sea for a few seconds and is not rushing to the nearby city. Unmanned caves, arranging simple rituals, creating spiritual walls, "squirming hunger", "the death knell" revolver, Aztec copper whistle, "Growser Travels" and the soil contaminated with the blood of Senigal The sacrifice was over the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he went four steps into the mysterious space, sat in the position of the "fool", and took the metal vial before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was stored on the fog, the remaining blood in the vial did not solidify, and Klein, who put on the glove and stuffed other items, poured a few drops and smeared it. On the dark brown cover of Grosser's Travels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咦...After joining the new characters, why didn’t you open a new story and start over again... Klein looked at the book without changing his name and suddenly got a doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still has to think in the future, the eyes are blurred, and there are countless transparent creatures hidden around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is clear soon, Klein found himself sitting on a long wooden bench by the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where he left before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
