			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing here, Klein and Leonard both lifted their gaze from the letterhead and looked at each other and shouted:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a madman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lalhous is a hidden madman?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is really a madman with paranoia and anti-social personality... Klein’s thoughts are turning, his heart is tight, and he is busy returning his sight to the letter:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ladies and gentlemen, my reminder is that I have placed a bomb in Tingen City that will continue to grow bombs over time."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go find it, grab it before it blasts itself, if the game fails, a bang, the whole city of Tingen will become a ruin, believe me, in I didn't do any deception in this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Larousus who likes to surprise friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bomb? Klein looked Leonard, wondering to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard pointed the letter at the sun, turned it over and looked at it, and found no other clues:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The bomb should be just a synonym. I have never heard of a bomb that can get stronger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein frowned, thoughtfully The answer is: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I mean, this may be a mysterious bomb, such as some evil rituals that constantly accumulate power... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard squinted his head as if listening to something, and his expression suddenly became dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed his head and said: "Maybe your guess is correct. Is there a description in front of this letter? The child labor that continues to die, because of the environment And the factory workers who have worked hard for a decade, and the women workers who have the risk of serious illness and can only get a meager salary, the factory that has covered countless resentment, this may be the power of the 'bomb' that Lanerus can continue to grow stronger. Source."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very likely to be!" Kline's emotions are tight. "We must report to the captain immediately!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be so nervous, you should be very clear, Llanus is a The name 'scammer', his description of 'no lie,' may itself be a lie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, no matter what, we have to go back Tellan told the captain that it would be best to apply to the church and ask them to send a mysterious expert to find the altar through the irregular collection of those resentments. The position "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; a very skilled way Well ...... However, a similar arrangement is similar to the altar Hood Eugen Why do I want to help.? What role can a “psychologist” play in this kind of thing? Klein did not object, left Leonard Street 62 with Leonard and rushed back to Zouteland Street in a rental carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just entering the door of the Black Thorns Security Company, Klein saw two acquaintances, one full and one thin, the wife and sister of Maynard . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They still wear black skirts, black hats, and cover their looks with a fine black veil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ladies were about to talk to Rosanne, and suddenly saw Klein return, so he turned his body and greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really are the most elite people in this industry." Mrs. Maynard gently decapitated and said lowly, "I am very satisfied with this result and appreciate it." The style of your work, this is what you deserve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin woman handed a light brown paper bag to Klein, which contained a stack Thick cash, with a denomination of 10 pounds, has 5 pounds, 1 pound, and 5 soler and 1 soler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein now has the heart to pay attention to the problem of money, immediately thrown to Roshan: "You give Mrs. Oliana, I think the two distinguished ladies will not count the wrong money."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the corner of his eye swept the Mrs. Maynard’s "Tingen City Honest Man", with two news in the most prominent position on the front page:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Old Baron's Will was killed as a result of his involvement in the murder of Mr. Maynard"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Mayor of Mr. Dennis Resignation, I apologize for the deterioration of the security situation in the last three months of the city of Tingen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Xuelun’s case finally reached an agreement? I haven't had time to read the newspaper yet... Klein turned to the two ladies and followed Leonard through the partition to the captain's office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Is there a clue?" Dunn Smith folded the file, raised his head, and looked at Klein and Leonard with a faint ashes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a letter left by Lalhous." Leonard did not describe too much, directly filling the letter with madness and provocation. Delivered to the captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den started the stationery and quickly browsed it. At the end of the day, he looked at the forehead:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A madman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He only has sequence 8, up to sequence 7."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Ryan sincerely agreed: "Lalus is a dangerous person who is very destructive to social stability. Even if he is weak, he can't despise him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Next, he described himself and Leonard’s guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den touched his own hairline:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also mine I will immediately send a telegram to the church and ask them to send a mysterious expert to help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one knows what Lairus called the bomb 'How dangerous is it, we must be careful enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait for the sacred church, I will arrange for follow-up action."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and Leonard glanced at each other and nodded at the same time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain took the opportunity to telegraph to the church, and Klein returned to the reception hall and took a copy of the "Tingen City Honest Man" from Rosanne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the partition and concentrated on reading the two previous news:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... ... Mrs. Shelen, the widow of the old Baron of the Hoy family, was suspected to be related to the sudden death of Mr. Maynard... The police department received the line report and stayed up late, discovering that Mrs. Shelen and her accomplices had stunned the servants and the attendants. In the bedroom, she worshipped the demon. They refused to surrender and tried to resist, resulting in the death of a heroic police officer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ultimately, Xuelun The wife and her accomplices paid the price of their lives for their sinful cause."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "...The mayor of the city, Mr. Dennis, resigned after the deterioration of the security situation in Tingen, and announced that he will no longer participate in the next year's election. In the next few months, Mr. Harry, the deputy mayor, will act as the mayor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a heroic police officer...this is right En Li's description of it? Klein sighed and knew that this was the best way to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the internal regulations of the night, in order to prevent the evil forces from retaliating against their families, even if they sacrifice, they cannot be named by ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is also a lady, but she is not very old, at most in her early 20s, wearing a lotus hat, wearing a loose skirt, with a bright forehead, long blonde hair, green eyes, and melancholy and calm temperament. It is a pretty good beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most striking thing about her is the tall belly, which seems to have been pregnant for more than seven months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein stunned and felt where he had seen the young pregnant woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he heard Leonard stunned and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Megas ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mego Ossie...Yes, the young girl who was deceived by Llanus! She is pregnant with the children of Lalhous, and the spirit has caused some problems. She said that her children will sing in the womb and whistle... Klein is stunned, and it is not unexpected why Leonard will know. Mei Gaoousi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the people and things related to the Llanus case were re-examined, the girl’s photo was seen by every night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein knew her earlier, when she was married to her aunt, Ms. Christina, who was deceived by Lalhous, and took her to the Divination Club to ask for help. Even asked the child in the belly is not the words of the relevant items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Mecoos, who heard Leonard’s voice, looked at the two with a slightly innocent eyes, politely said:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Megas, what are you doing to our Black Thorny Security Company? Is there anything that needs to be delegated?” Klein asked in the first two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is puzzled by the sudden visit of Megacoos, and feels that this is very, very, very coincidental. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just found the letter left by Llanus, Mei Gaoousi came to the door? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mego Oss felt his stomach and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know why I suddenly thought about coming to Zouteland Street, and suddenly I was thinking about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mental problems have worsened... Klein remembered that he hadn't had time to open his vision last time. He couldn't confirm the status of Mega Koss, so his teeth were light and he was about to flick to the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he suddenly froze, and there was a stronger thought in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't see!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't see! Can't see!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See you will die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See Will die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein statue stands in place, forehead 沁There was a lot of cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like having a deepest and deepest nightmare, almost unable to wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he understood one thing, that is, the last time he was not too late to open his vision, but his own spirituality perceived an unimaginable danger. Let yourself subconsciously become sluggish, miss the opportunity, and forget the follow-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Klein had not thoroughly digested the "Divination" potion, and had not promoted the sequence 8. The spiritual blockade was very subtle and difficult to detect, just like instinct. Doing a habitual action, you certainly won't care too much, but now, the spiritual reminder based on the "clown" hunch is so clear, so obvious! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a dozen seconds, Klein finally broke out of the cold and sweaty state, looking sideways at Leonard and found that the "midnight poet" was also a The cold sweat of the face and the fear of the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
