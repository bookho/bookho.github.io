			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short period of thinking, the "hidden" Jia De Li Ya made the most favorable choice, saying without feeling: <br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will first look at the common monsters around the Silver City and make decisions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An empty gloved white wolf ... Are people who have been in the sea for a long time so good at licking wool? In other words, the small "sun" posture is so good that people can't help but want to slap a hand... "Foolish" Klein instinctively excluded himself from the team of empty gloves and white wolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." "Sun" Dairik, under the gaze of "Justice" and others, did not hesitate to agree with Ms. Claim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recalls the content, comes out, lists the common monsters around the area of ​​Silver City, but not as detailed as the previous one, there are many omissions, after all The "sun" approach has a limited increase in memory and time has passed many days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hidden" Jia De Li Ya took the information and looked carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more she looks, the more she is scared, because the number of monsters exceeds her imagination, which is several hundred times more than a few hundred times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the use of this is the ancient name, if she is a member of the "Moss assassination" chased by knowledge, and has reached the sequence 5, seen More, knowing a lot, there is no way to know what those names really mean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even then, there are still a lot of monsters that she has never heard of, just like in dreams, imagine that those hiding in the depths of the dark will never really The "shadow" of the appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is Silver City? How come there are so many monsters? After ten seconds, Jia De Li Ya raised his head, his expression remained unchanged, and his voice said calmly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You exchanged the history of Silver City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." "The Sun" Dairik’s eyes lit up as if he saw the dawn of promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly showed the outline of the history of Baiyincheng with the help of Mr. "fool" - he has a lot of experience, he knows, more complete More detailed content is much higher than the value of the radiant Chiling tree fruit, so there is reservation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hidden" Jia Delia knows that he is not a "fool", it is impossible for members to wait patiently for reading, so feel free to turn over and confirm After the value, I would like to ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can I give you the fruit of the shining tree?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice just fell, suddenly thought of something, with a guess, so I looked sideways at the top of the bronze long table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Mr. 'Footer', is it a sacrifice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the "justice" Audrey, who is ready to answer on the same side, obviously Then, swallow the words of your mouth and go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. "Hidden" is very powerful and very insightful, and directly guessed the way to sacrifice and give! Audrey controlled the subtle expression on her face and groaned in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Klein gently decapitated and did not explain too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes in a pirate general, the "sequence 5" route of the strong 5, can not know how to sacrifice, this is even their expertise One, and the other party also has the title of "fool", there is no problem of lack of necessary conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, when a true god exists and witnesses a gathering, sacrifices and gifts are the most convenient and safest way to trade... and spiritual communication can Directly solve the knowledge exchange... "The Hidden" Jia Delia thanked and turned to the "Sun" Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will finish it as soon as possible. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to have nothing unusual on her face, but her heart is not calm. Just just flipping through the information provided by the "Sun", she found that Silver City really It’s full of quirks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a knowledgeable and fascinating sea tycoon, she immediately described one of the most famous concepts in history according to the description of time and events, “Cataclysm”! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, according to this idea, she has further speculation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God abandoned Ground!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, "The Hidden" Jia Delia’s mind has emerged from the figure that people want to look up, and a slightly sigh of words emerges. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was always looking for 'the land of God's abandonment," he said, hiding the final answer to everything."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Sun" comes from the "land of God" that Russell the Great could not find? Can Mr. Fool connect there? No, maybe, He was awakened from there... "The Hidden" Jia Delia was shocked and dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was also because of the "moon", "justice", "sun" and other people's sequence is not high, will be a little contempt for Tarot, think that "fool" It was not long before the recovery, the level of members that could be pulled in was obviously insufficient, and now I have to re-adjust my cognition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involved in the "land of God", involving the Church of the Storm, involving the Mother Earth Church, involving the aristocratic class of Lun... Perhaps it is to develop from a low sequence, These members can not be suspiciously embarked on a high level in their respective circles, playing a more important role... And I, because of the Moss assassination, or the Queen's Majesty? Jia Delia seriously analyzed the purpose of Mr. "The Fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the trading part is nearing the end, "Moon", "Sun", "Justice" have finalized their respective transactions, "Hidden" Jia Delia Because it is still observing, cautious is heavy, no blind opening, revealing its own information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger originally wanted to purchase the magic formula of the sequence 5 "Ocean Singers" in advance, to prepare for the future, but "hidden" Join, let him be extra-armed, temporarily give up this plan, prepare to wait for the real promotion to be a "winder", stronger, and more room for manoeuvre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic" Firth is because it takes a long time to get the "Astrology" potion formula and certain materials from the teacher, before I don't know what to buy in advance, I can only sit quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She actually has some impulsiveness in her heart, wants to buy a magical item, make up her own "master of tricks" ability is relatively fancy, not strong enough, "apprentice" is just good at The problem of opening the door through the wall, but the reality of factors limits her desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, her deposit exceeds £400, which is quite good for the middle class, but she clearly remembers that Miss Justice just bought it last time. The magical item cost a full £5,500. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is more general, but the magical items with less negative effects, one or two thousand pounds should also be necessary... "Magic" Firth sits lazily There, I can't open the mouth of the purchase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein manipulated the "world" and looked around in a circle, said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Need the eyes of a six-winged gargoyle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Master of Secret Masters" aid, the golden spring water and the dragon tree bark of Sunia Island are mysterious Common and commonly used items in the world, as long as they are purchased in stages, will not be suspicious, so Klein only mentions the eyes of the six-winged gargoyle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "hidden" Jia Delia looked at the "world" and said that the speed of speech is not too fast: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"300 pounds, or equivalent gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has noticed that Lun’s golden pound was used in the previous transaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a master of a pirate group, it’s backed by the “great star” of ancient forces, the resources are very rich, and the price is cheaper than normal...if not The small "sun" is about to be promoted, and I am about to get rid of the mental pollution in the extraordinary characteristics. I want to consult her about this issue... Klein thought about it and let the "world" laugh and laugh:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
