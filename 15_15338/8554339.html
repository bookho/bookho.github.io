			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the "master key" and the diamond-set silver pocket watch has been taken away by the thief, here still maintains the look of my dream divination... Klein looks around Circles, black iron pots, glass jars and bronze lamp holders with many candles but already extinguished have been brought into the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His vision and inspiration tell him that these are very common items, without the slightest spiritual brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, but compared to before, there is still a little more... Klein stretches out the left palm with black gloves and touches the long table. s surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His finger was immediately contaminated with obvious dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein carefully searched it over and did a divination. No secret room or dark space was found, so he turned his eyes to the brown note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully open, the content of the first page is reflected in his nephew:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It will be a history of the resurgence of the cursed family!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to write down every key point!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Unfortunately, the potion that you just finished eating the sequence 9 died out of control, the glory of the Abraham family still can only stay in the mouth... Klein whispered, continued to browse, and quickly Turn the page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the value is confirmed, he will take the notes and stay on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our Abraham family is one of the top patriarchs of the Quaternary and is the main supporter of the Tudor dynasty, that era, whether it was Lun's The Gusdu family, the Einhorn family of Fossac, and the Soren family of Intis, the Castilla family of Fenetport, can only look up to us."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really, they were not weak at the time, but we are stronger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even in the rumor of Antigone The Sri Lankan family, the Charato family, is also worse than us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the glory of the family disappeared in the Battle of the Four Emperors, the ancestors Terry was not known in the war where the gods personally ended, and the rest of the high-ranking powers were degraded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And since then, our Abraham family It was a terrible curse, and generations of generations who tried to revive the family’s ancestors went crazy without exception, and they lost control. Some of them were becoming high-ranking strongmen. Some still stay in sequence 8, sequence 7."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And every loss of control brings a near-destructive disaster to the family, those cursed Forgetting the surnames inscribed in the blood, unscrupulously hurt other members of the family, they are already monsters!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the continuation of the family, Abrahams made The painful decision is to stop living and move to the northern continent in the form of a small family. In this way, even if someone is out of control and kills, the blood will not be cut off."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My father is afraid of cursing and chooses to be an ordinary person. If the surname in the blood is still shining, he is not even willing to tell me these things."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to record them, I will review them often, bearing in mind the glory and disaster of the Abraham family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary of each generation In the end, it will be out of control, no one is spared? The curse of the Abraham family is even more terrible than that of the Silver City... Wait, they should all be "apprentices", is it to hear the help of the "Men"? This, where is the cry for help, clearly is the curse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, according to the description of "Magician", she did not hear the illusory slang at the full moon because she became an "apprentice". I used the bracelet on the wrist, and then, no matter whether she wore a bracelet or not, she couldn’t get rid of it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the extraordinary people of the Abraham family? ? Perhaps the curse has nothing to do with Mr. Gate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a certain possibility that the object that he is most likely to locate is naturally a descendant of the same bloodline and in the lower sequence of the same extraordinary path. Unfortunately, since the strong all fall, his shouting has brought the family a long stretch. The curse of thousands of years almost made Abraham disappear all...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Mr. Gate knows about Quaternary history and understands the Battle of the Four Emperors. The reason for the detailed process? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my guess is true, I can only sigh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham is really unfortunate family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if the things mentioned by the owner of the note have been affected by the thousands of years and the family’s diaspora, and thus there is a deviation... “The Battle of the Four Emperors” In the meantime, did the gods actually end in person? Klein frowned and turned pages faster and faster:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The choice of being an ordinary person’s father ultimately failed to overcome the disease, which caused my mother to suffer a great blow and soon followed.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also means that I am free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What makes me miserable is that my father is not letting me embark on the cursed road, about the extraordinary Nothing tells me, I have to touch it myself, but I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Fortunately, he did not dare to violate the elder’s orders, still before his death. I gave me the apprenticeship of 'apprentices', 'masters of tricks' and 'astrologers'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to re-copy these three recipes, lest Forgotten: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 9, 'Apprentice'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 8, 'Master of the Master'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 7, 'Astrology'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked slightly eyebrows and felt that it was a worthwhile trip tonight I feel that I have not wasted the purifying bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he has to go to the fog to confirm the true and false. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Astrology”... The “Apprentice” approach also has a career in the divination series... So it seems that a guess I made before is likely to be close to the truth. The "Divination" approach and the "apprentice" approach may be interchangeable in high sequence... Klein gently beheaded and continues to page down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the value of the note has been determined, he does not want to leave the scene for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the note tells you where to hide something, he must have to come back. If so, why bother? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦,, during the paper flip, Klein roughly figured out the extraordinary journey of the descendants of the Abraham family:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After his parents passed away, he began to try to contact the mysterious circle, collect information related to the sequence of potions, and purchase the corresponding extraordinary materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly two years of hard work, after recording a lot of true or false occult knowledge, he finally succeeded and deployed the "apprentice" potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote at the end of the note:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Based on my occultal knowledge, full moon In the night, the spiritual world and the reality overlap most, that is, when the spirituality is most prosperous, it is most conducive to taking the potion and getting promoted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will At the next full moon, become an 'apprentice'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to step up and reproduce the glory of the Abraham family!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the level of sequence 7 is reached, I can try to contact the elders according to the family rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
