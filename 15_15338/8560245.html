			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because "Golden Cod Snake" Odell is not a pirate, it is hard to say clearly about his various rumors, and Klein took back the stairway. Look, go to the bar, find a place to sit down, tap the desk way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"a cup of Zarha."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the local malt beer, which is much cheaper than the Southwell beer that needs to be shipped from the Northland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"3pence." The bartender also recovered from a quiet state and picked up a reversed cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a whisper in the bar, and under the guise of a gas wall lamp, the reason for the "silver snake" Odell to buy ten tickets was discussed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He must have been tracked, three ships with ten tickets, that is, the trackers can't figure out which one they will go on!" The gang members who picked up the sleeve arm and tattooed expressed their opinions based on their experience of two absconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An adventurer who screams with anger and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know Austria Del, if his plan is so simple, then he will not have the nickname 'silver coin viper'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I bet they won't go there Any passenger ship represented by ten tickets! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only thing that can be confirmed is that they are going to Port Pritz."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another adventurer Wen Yan shook his head: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe to Pritzport this information is also fake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The former gang members listened at a glance and said nothing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to your description, Odell probably thought of what you thought of, Therefore, he just wants to go to Port of Pritz, that is, to go to one of the three ships!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two adventurers Zhangkou wants to refute, can think carefully I thought, I really felt that there was no small possibility, and I couldn’t speak for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made the gang member very happy and drank the remaining spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is carrying a cup of Zarha, boring and listening to a small mouth to drink, waiting for the fake identification and the ticket back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will take three quarters of an hour, hopefully there will be no accidents, don't let the bar be confused..." He silently prayed and painted a red moon in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale yellow beer is slowing down at a slower speed. Klein sometimes looks at the wall clock on the wall, and sometimes looks at the doorway, hoping that time will pass faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than half an hour passed, the bar door suddenly opened and the night wind outside came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No... Klein’s mouth twitched, resisting the urge to smile, turning his head and looking to the place where the sound was coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five people at the door, the first one is dark brown, with a deep face, hard lines, and a good Lun character. It is about forty years old. Look like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is cold and majestic, making the bar unconscious and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind him, three men and a woman are dressed in trench coats, holding the revolver without any disguise, it seems that as long as there is a little abnormality, they will aim at the shot instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know, not in any wanted order, there is no bounty... Klein swears and keeps the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five intruders suddenly dispersed, came to different alcoholic guests, bent over and looked at them, and asked: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is 'Silver Cod Snake' Oder?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He, they went to the second floor!" The alcoholic who was asked was pointing at the stairs almost simultaneously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really someone is tracking Odell, is this what I want to do with the "mysterious queen" or the "silver coin viper"? Or, because of the mysterious man wearing a hood and eating candy next to him? Klein took another beer and watched the intruders split four to the second floor, leaving the remaining one in place and continuing to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the latter mastered the situation of O'Dell looking for Denier to buy a ticket, and immediately went to the black and black black market businessman, Shen Sheng asked :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frankly tell me, where did Odell buy the ticket?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deni He did not take advantage of his own network, and smiled out: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He did not explicitly say that the request was ten, belonging to three different ships, time It is tomorrow, the destination is Port Pritz."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real?" The inquirer is a radical man in his twenties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denier whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can ask everyone here, they are I heard it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shit!" The man angrily pushed Denier and turned to other alcoholic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denil stood unsteadily, squatting back, seeing it fall, the back of the head hitting the edge of a small round table, and then feeling the strength of the shoulder position, The body immediately recovered its balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously looked around and saw the guest who had just signed the fake identity certificate to buy the black ticket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, this damn military dog ​​walks!" Denier said thankfully, and whispered his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Klein who holds him. He doesn’t want to have any accidents with the “ticket dealer”. After all, he has paid 5 pounds in cash in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is his habit to use people who are affected by innocence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military is walking the dog? In Baiam, this description often means that the target is the person in the military situation... "Silver Coin" Odell What did this do? Klein silently, excluding the possibility of someone targeting the "mysterious queen." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no point to the Lun military. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his mind and went to the second floor of the Military Intelligence 9 members hurried down the stairs, while heading straight to the door, while talking to the companion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been a long time to jump out of the window!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of people came in a hurry and went in a hurry, the bar was soon The restlessness was restored, and only the door that was still slightly shaken showed the lack of calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein finally waited for the fake identification and black ticket, no longer worried about being accidentally interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After paying the remaining £15 in cash, he left the seaweed bar and returned to the regular hotel where he was rented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"John Yord... This name is too easy to save? Before returning to Beckland, you have to get a more authentic identification." Klein flipped through a series of identification documents and threw them into the suitcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a shower, relaxed, and prepared to leave Baiam tomorrow to open the last voyage of the "travel". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he heard a loud knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who? Klein was busy taking off his bathrobe, putting on his clothes and pants and walking to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few policemen in black uniforms outside, one looks like a Lun, the rest is not a mixed-race, it is a pure indigenous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please show your proof of identity." A mixed-race child said politely, because the opposite gentleman seems to be a Lun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, I just got a copy, or else I have to go to the police station tonight, or run on the spot, change the look, come back again... Ryan returned to the room and took out the identification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the Luen police officer turned over and flipped freely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Yorde, you Is a person living here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, everyone at the hotel can prove it." Klein calmly replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Luen police officer showed a little smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you seen this person? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said while letting the police officer next to open a portrait with an unusually thin body and a white and messy old man, except these There are no obvious features. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Klein shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He likes to eat candy," added the Luen police officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Candy..." Klein suddenly remembered the mysterious man with a hood around "Golden Snake" Odell, who had been eating brown for a short interval. candy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considered, Klein did not conceal:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May have seen, before me At the seaweed bar, I saw a man who loves to eat candy next to the 'silver coin viper' Oder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lun officer did not disguise his disappointment The expression, a simple thank you, ended the inquiry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they knocked on other rooms, Klein closed the wooden door and returned to the easy chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Odell’s affairs not only led to the military’s nine places, but also let the Governor’s Office arrange the manpower and conduct a full-scale investigation. It’s not simple...” Whispering two sentences, decided to go above the fog, browse the prayer light around the "Poseidon Scepter", and find more information from the prayers of many believers in Baiam, lest you be involved in the inexplicable mistakes because of the wrong response. Big vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the bathroom, on the fog, Klein waved the white bones around the debris to fly out of the debris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One light spot to browse the past, he can only confirm that the questioning was not a small-scale thing, the goal is Odell and the mysterious person, but can't know more many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, he turned his gaze to a spot that was specially marked by divinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It belongs to a mixed-race policeman named Braa. He calls himself "Poseidon", and he humiliates and reforms the letter "The Lord of the Storm", only in the police station. Climb higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now a Superintendent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Klein put the will of "Poseidon" into the corresponding spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Braya, who was working in the police station to arrange a subordinate, suddenly came out with a cold sweat, and found an excuse to enter the bathroom and whispered: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The leader of the sea and the spiritual world, the great Cavitowa, your followers report to you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The key person to look for tonight is a very thin old man. His hair has turned white, but it is still very dense, just very messy. He is very afraid of cold. He also wears thick clothes in Baiyam. He likes to eat sugar, just like he is a steam engine. The candy is like high-quality coal. The above means to find him but not hurt him.
