			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Klein’s deeper understanding of the mysterious field of extraordinary, as he gradually tested the ability of this space above the fog, he faced When "justice", "downside down" and "sun", they are no longer as guilty as before, no longer thinking about keeping an inscrutable image, lest the members of the Tarot will sharply poke him. Camouflage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now knows that the gods of this world are powerful and unique, but they are by no means omnipotent. This description is only the creator who created everything in the legend, only Silver City is still mourning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are limits to the gods, and the gods may be in trouble. This is what Kleen can confirm now, whether it is the Book of the Storm or the Revelation of the Night. , more or less related to the corresponding content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Klein consciously added "personality" in the recent Tarot gathering, to make himself a little closer to the gods but for some reason Restricted power who cannot move freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, even if he occasionally shows that he does not know enough about certain things, and occasionally asks for help, it will not cause doubts from members of the Tarot Club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the premise of all this is that he has been through the past few attempts, through the "powerful" Azick to show the powerful strength, will be near the gods The image is undoubtedly implanted in the hearts of "justice", "downside down" and "sun". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, I hope that this shaping can be successful, then you don’t have to worry too much about answering their questions... Of course, things that are “common sense”, Still have to be stretched, can't show up... Kline fingers tapped the edge of the old long table, laughing low: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to issue a mission." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task? "Justice" Audrey's ears are slightly moving, her eyes are wide, and she is surprised and expects to be embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clearly remembers that this is the first time that Mr. Fool has officially issued a mission! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he also made some entrustments in front of him, they are all types of prepaid remuneration. It seems to be a casual collection task to meet the principle of equivalence exchange. ... This time He used the word "promulgation"... As a "reader", Audrey is very good at reading the hidden meaning from the words. At the same time, she was keenly aware that “the hanging man” did not seem to change, but the actual situation was extremely tense, and the “sun” ignorant, this will It became a very normal thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can choose to pick up, or not." Klein used the "clown" ability to make his tone seem quite relaxed, "I am another The latter arrived in Beckland, and he hoped to accomplish one thing, but it was not convenient for him to come forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional leader... "Panging man" It seems as if I have thought about it, and I am not surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his eyes, the "folly" Mr. This kind of god-like powerful existence, having multiple leaders is the default fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if Mr. Fool’s deaf person has a sequence... Hey, I actually owe him a reward for the best of the best... although Mr. Fool The reward was paid by the "upside down man", and he did not see the money, but I did pray with the help of the mind, and the "Hurricane Lieutenant" was killed by the leader... His 眷The person still needs a certain amount of activity funds... "Justice" Audrey has a little bit of thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, in her eyes, 30,000 gold pounds plus a large plantation really belong to huge wealth, but that way, it will not live for her. Causes too obvious impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a good, no, it doesn't matter, hey, it will be a little bit of a pain, a little bit... Audrey is sincerely in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a girl who has not yet matured, she does not mention the big plantation. Even if she has the remaining 30,000 gold pounds, she does not have absolute dominance. Only a few shares of the Beckland Arms Group were purchased under the arrangement of the Earl of Father Hall, and a company that sought to introduce some of the technology of the armored ship into the commercial ship sector was invested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing "Justice" and others did not speak, Klein issued a task: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What he wants to accomplish is to assassinate the Ambassador of the Republic of the Republic of Lun in the Kingdom of Lun , Becker Lang. Jean Madan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aesthetic Ambassador of the Republic of Intis?" "Justice" Audrey failed to control himself, ignoring Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an act that will cause disputes between the two countries and even a war! As a qualified aristocratic lady, she first thought of international relations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the question of Mr. Fool’s not being hands-on, she takes it for granted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Is it a big man who helps his subordinates to do things? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kingdom did not see the King’s personal deportation after the defeat of the war on the east coast of Byron, and at the same time changed one general and re-sent the troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔, it is said that the King’s majesty is quite eager to go out, but was stopped by the nobility and the ministers...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger is only slightly surprised by this task, his focus is on another part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Footer" is still unable to deeply intervene in the real world... My guess is correct... I don’t know that we can influence the establishment of the connection. To what extent... can you easily deprive you of life? A little bit of self-satisfaction, Alger gradually spread his thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik heard two eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intis Republic is what? What is the ambassador? This patchwork giant language is very strange! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked around and kept the relaxed attitude:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you? Willing to accept this task?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to get?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount... let I have no reason to kill an innocent person, I can't convince myself... and this is likely to lead to a disaster, stemming from the disaster of war... Audrey, who wants to raise his hand, hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, "upside down" sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I heard that Ambassador Becker also was the intelligence head of the Kingdom of the Republic of Intis. He secretly supported the bloody march, planned some incidents that undermined the relationship between the nobility and the rich, and spread a lot of rumors and incited the people to oppose the government." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to see the hesitation of "justice", detailing the dark side of Becker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if the ambassador is an extraordinary person, But many clues suggest that he is likely to be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a lot of extraordinary people around him, belonging to the extraordinary people of the Intis intelligence agency, and this department Long-term influenced by the original royal family Sauron family, mastering the front part of the 'hunter' route."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, whether the two countries will break out of war, only depends on I don’t want to fight at the top of the two sides, and have nothing to do with the life and death of a diplomat.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the assassination of Russell the Great, Intis went through several big The shock, and finally maintained a stable republican system, the Sauron family suffered a brutal blow during the Russell period, the strength of all aspects fell very badly, can only accept this reality reluctantly, change the goal to compete for seats, and secretly affect the country Intelligence department and a small army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the news provided by "Inverted Man", Audrey’s hesitation in his heart disappeared and he nodded gracefully:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In recent years, the Fossac Empire has expanded very hard. It has defeated the Kingdom and the Republic of Intis in the east coast of the Bay of Lang, and the stars have been pushed to them afterwards. The high level of the Republic and the people are acceptable and willing to believe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
