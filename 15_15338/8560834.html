			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you came to the door, Walter used the light of the gas street lamp to find through the gap of the iron fence that there was no one outside, and the street was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, Walter wondered if he had got it wrong, and there was no doorbell at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He set the god, walked quickly to the servant room behind the small building, shouted a few of them, let them take a double-barreled shotgun, and patrolled the main house back and forth. Surrounded by thieves or robbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter didn't call the police immediately, because nothing has happened yet, the bell ringing of the door may have just been made by a mischievous tramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the nearest sewer, the former sneakers held the metal handles, layer by layer, to the bleak area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly stopped, leaning against the mossy wall, slowly sliding down, sitting on the dirty ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes closed again, as if he was still in a coma, and in front of him, a middle-aged man wearing an old halter cap wearing a dark red coat It is the secret of Klein, "the resentment" Senol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniol bent down his back and found 7 Sule 11 pence coins and small powders with different powders from the inside pocket of the sneak Cloth bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room in the room Klein remotely manipulated the secret couples dozens of meters away, one by one to identify those powders, and found that as expected, they are all in the field of the dead. A variety of herbal powders, some of which can be used for "psychic"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The extraordinary person from Byron is very likely to belong to the “collector” route, even if the sequence 7 “Psychic” is not prepared, prepare the corresponding herbs Powder and essential oils are also very normal. After all, those materials are not only a "psychic" effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Klein manipulated the secret agent Seignor, quickly arranged the ceremony and prayed to the "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he responded to the fog and let the other person do the rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he returned to the real world, continued to manipulate the "resentment" Senol, and really began to "psychic." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the twilight storm, Klein saw the spirit of the sneak, he was embarrassed, fuzzy and transparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is your name? Which force does it belong to?" Senigol asked in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sneak replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Godops, I belong to the 'Black Party '."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Skull Party seems to be a gangster on the edge of the Eastern District and near the pier in the Beckland Bridge area, mainly based on people of the Bailang lineage, although It’s not as good as the Zmang party’s brutal and ruthless, dare to fight and dare to kill, but it’s also hot and not afraid of killing... Klein recalls the information he has collected in the past, and let Señol continue to ask:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mainly do? Why are you looking for Richardson?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goldops said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are fighting for God.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We were originally members of the East Bye, The establishment of the Black Skull Party is to acquire intelligence and obtain funds. In addition to these, there is also a task of collecting various items related to Death and sending them back to the Southland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time, we have a solid clue that the collection of Count Wolff has a mask from the mausoleum of the Aegis family, which is God's Descendants.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to get this mask, we need to send someone to work at the Earl of Wolfe or mix into the banquet ball held by Earl Wolff, and Richardson is a very good candidate. He has not participated in the predecessors of various organizations and has a rich servant experience. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that there is such a thing. At the ball tonight, a lady mentioned that a small number of poorly-funded aristocrats sold many land and manors, dismissed almost all servants, leaving less than ten servings, barely Maintain a decent life, and when you need a large banquet or dance party, spend money to hire a group of temporary workers in organizations such as the Helping the Family Servant Association...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp And, the Earl of Wolfe actually has a mask of the descendants of the Deathly Descent family. I remember that Mr. Azick’s surname is Aegis... Unfortunately, I don’t want to be disturbed by accident at this time, otherwise I might find a way to help Azick. Mr. got this mask... Klein silently whispered a few words and asked Señol to continue:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you get to know Richardson? "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goldops said dullly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are in East Byron The manor knows that at that time, we were all slaves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And slaves , Someone quietly spread the faith of death, I, Richardson, his mother, in a kind of life, death inevitably become believers, secretly joined the slaves in the influential organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Later, Richardson’s mother died of illness and he was taken to Bakerland, and I stayed in East Byron to find a chance to escape. The manor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A few years later, I was sent to Beckland, and in a chance, I met Richardson, he, he He even forgot his mother's death, forgot the abuse he had suffered, forgot the belief in God, and the will to be corrupted by the so-called calm life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to avoid me, he deliberately made mistakes and changed three employers in succession. However, how can he think that his past companions are no longer ordinary people! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has the power to choose, as long as they don't hurt others, but Richardson and I are two kinds of people... Klein in the room Closed his eyes and asked Seignor to ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the influential organization in the slave?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goldops hesitated the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eternal Life, the person who believes in death, will be leaving the pain After the real world, I will get eternal life in the underworld."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternal Life...I know that the branch of the spiritual group...the Klein pair of "nights" This is quite understandable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to manipulate the secret agent Seignor to inquire about each other and obtained a large amount of information related to the eternal life, the East Bye, and the Black Party. A group of Dopps is full of blood of innocent people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End the psychic, handle the traces, wait for two quarters of an hour, and Klein once again let the "resentment" enter the body of Godopus and drive him to climb Go out of the sewer and return to the shadow of the street. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in the 160th Berkrund Street, the servants of the double-barreled shotguns have been less patrolling, and it seems that the danger of hiding has passed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pretended not to notice anything, still sleeping in the master bedroom, but he had arranged the ceremony, summoned himself, responded to himself, and took Az The copper whistle, the iron cigarette case and the "squirming hunger" left the house silently in the state of ghost shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is adorned behind Godopus, always maintaining a distance of 80 meters, thereby manipulating the "hostage" possessed by the secret affair, let him go around In other neighborhoods, board the rental carriage at the intersection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than an hour, Godopus returned to the headquarters of the Black Party, a hut near the dock. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large number of arms in it, and there are several members of the East Brigade Reunion, which constitute the top of the Black Party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goldops" knocked on the door in accordance with the agreed way, to a member who greeted:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Richardson has already yielded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
