			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s fingers just touched the dark eyes, and there was an auditory hallucination in his ears, and his head burst into pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, there are some strange things in his horizons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless black illusion lines, from the bodyguards and himself, from every part of the body, spreading out, penetrating the void, through To infinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a horror that can make people with phobias faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein suddenly fangs, can no longer withstand the feeling of being corroded and contaminated, put the black eyes into the iron cigarette case . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything returned to normal and his negative state eased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, Klein has spared no effort to make a guess:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is the secret master The essence of extraordinary ability? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you see and control certain lines of each person and spirit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, it’s polluted, too many side effects, can’t be used as magical items...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the time being, I don’t consider the above-mentioned fog to try to purify. This is the second time there is to provoke the “real creator”. It is very likely that he is ready to be prepared... At that time, it is estimated that the resurrection can’t be resurrected... first Learn and master the relevant knowledge and make a decision...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, he spit out a sigh of gas, and the young bodyguard chose the rudimentary paper man and corresponding After the material, he bent over again and picked up the 13 pounds of 5 Sule 8 pence of cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he looked at Rosago’s headless body and the blood of the land, and said with a headache:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We clean up the scene."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale body of the pale-haired pale bodyguard floats aside, said in a plain tone:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You come? Klein was half-suspecting and suspiciously stopping the action, looking sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguard lady came to Rosago halfway and walked down and squatted down to the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly sinks in, she and the body merge into one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rossago’s corpse’s fingers bounced twice, and the surrounding blood, brain and debris flowed back, and a head reunited at the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this head is covered with criss-crossing cracks, like a disgusting toy made up of small pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like a glass that is cracked but not broken immediately. It is faintly bloody and brain-flowing, and the bullets of the pistol bullets reflect the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein couldn’t help but take a step back and feel that this can be a top-notch horror in all ghost stories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rossago’s body climbed up, picked up the police cap, half covered his face, and the murder scene around him was clean. There are no traces any more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbeatable professional! Klein lamented in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the bodyguard and drove the body, the soft hat covered the face, and the pace went steady to the door, and the subconscious sighed:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't take a carriage, don't walk in a place where the lights are very bright."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would scare the driver and scare the pedestrians! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguard did not stop, completely ignoring his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you come back, go to the Les Police Station, the home of Sergeant Fasin, or find the original clothing of Rosago around Minsk Street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rosago wore a police uniform, and the ability of "no face" was obviously only related to itself. So, where was his previous clothes? He can't wear a police uniform all the time tonight! If I found the clothing of Rosago in the vicinity of MI9 and the police department, and I was not hurt, things would be a little trouble... Miss Bodyguard is not a strong member of the legal extraordinary team, an ordinary detective Being able to take out 1,000 pounds and ask for bodyguards is enough to lead people to doubt... Klein is constantly thinking about blocking all the loopholes in the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he planned to help the bodyguard with the divination ability to find Rosago’s original clothes and send the lost police uniform back, Rosago’s body paused. Then, I replied with a rubbing rust-like voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咦Yes, it’s very confident... Yes, the body of the bodyguard is between the flesh and the spirit, and the principle of divination is the spirit of the star spirit... So she will divination by instinct... Klein Something was lost, not to mention more, the shell in the revolver was also given to the other side, and then the body of Rosago was opened to open the door, and he went away, and closed the door very lightly and politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spoils I have chosen are the extraordinary characteristics of being polluted by the "real creator". I believe that no one can divinate them. Even if they do, they will feel the danger ahead of time. Dare to divination... Klein walked back to the sofa area and sat down, feeling quite scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle just lasted no more than a minute before and after, and there was no violent destruction of anything, but the hidden turmoil and danger were second only to his face. Oss and the experience of the baby in her belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there is a very strong bodyguard, even if there is a "dirty language", he is almost controlled by Rosago and killed without resistance. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability of the "Master of Secrets" is really amazing and powerful! According to the law of conservation of extraordinary characteristics, the extraordinary characteristics left by Rosago should contain all the main potions of Sequence 5, Sequence 6, Sequence 7, Sequence 8 and Sequence 9. If it is not contaminated with evil spirits, it can be combined with auxiliary materials. An ordinary person directly becomes the extraordinary person of sequence 5. Of course, this kind of luck promotion method has long been abandoned by history. This is the most primitive and dangerous method...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Step by step promotion according to the sequence is the best way for countless ancestors to verify with life... If you can get rid of the "real creator" pollution in the future, I must only use Rosago in the sequence of 6 liters sequence 5 The extra features left over, and the extra features that make me stronger, like the captain...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein recalls the previous things, raises his hand Pinch the forehead and turn to think about the more important aspects:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosago appears, indicating that Hermeso’s battle for the manuscript is over...he has no The spell is because in the previous battle The? When such an important time comes, he should have the idea of ​​diverting his gaze... Oh, the people in the military intelligence department did not expect that he would retaliate so boldly in this situation, did not send people to monitor, can only passively wait Rosago gave a "signal"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosago is an assistant to Becker, his actions should only be directed by Becker, after his death, as long as Becker also died, and there was no hidden danger in the whole thing... I don’t know if the assassination was unfolded, whether it was successful...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Tonight, due to the competition for the manuscript of Hermochem, Becker’s protective power will be in the weakest state. If it is me, I will definitely miss this opportunity. Becker must not have thought about it. Someone will assassinate. he! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has nothing to do with a coin, whispering: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Becker is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;铮! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 penny denomination of coins tumbling and falling again, fell to Klein's palm, head up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Baker Lang dead? Is it successful? Klein was happy in his heart, and the state of tension was relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no Rosso interference, he believes this result is correct! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter finally, it is finally over... Klein took a breath and spit out slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly leaned back against the back of the sofa, tired and relaxed looking out the window of the looming red moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the embassy of the Republic of Intis, two military officers Next to Becker's body, he examined his cause of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their companions, their bosses have chased out and tried to catch the assassin, but everyone understands that it is already late and there is no hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are severe injuries in the lungs, suspected diseases... The critical strike is very strong, stronger than the attacks of all the extraordinary 5s I have seen... "One of the military officers whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Disease? There are obvious traces of flesh and blood on the ground and on the bed, but there are no walls, and the sounds and movements of the fight are not delivered, plus that The characteristics of corrosion and annihilation of a critical strike have at least four extraordinary abilities that are not related..." Another military officer stood up and described the situation on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly paused and glanced at the other military officer, and spoke at the same time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shepherd!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few seconds, the squatting officer frowned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe It’s a gang, at least four different extraordinary people...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we are waiting to be judged! The separate Rose Bishop is mixed with the ambassador by secret law. We didn't find it normal. How did the other three get together? This is impossible!” The standing military officer denied the guess and hesitated. “But I heard that another sequence can also make something similar. The effect seems to be called 'recording officer', I don't know which way it is, and I don't know which organization it belongs to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nodded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The shepherd's suspicion is the biggest, the aurora will be mad, it's not surprising to do anything! I From the investigation of the identity of the woman who tempted the ambassador, damn, the Kingdom of Lun will certainly not let us investigate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aurora will help the damn, the beggar The madman who is doing the ass!" The military officer standing is annoyed and shakes his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambassador was stabbed and they will inevitably be punished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 Minsk Street, Klein has nothing to do Occur, endure fatigue, read the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than 20 minutes of appearance, he suddenly saw a bodyguard wearing a black court dress on the belly window, leaving a long-haired bodyguard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get it done?" Klein asked subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Bodyguard nodded lightly, no opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein thought for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your protection, this one Things are here to end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The remaining £900, I pay you in two days, you know, there is a limit on the amount of money.",<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or still handed to Maric?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale-faced lady opened her mouth and the sound seemed to penetrate Unreal, coming back and forth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
