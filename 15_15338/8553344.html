			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"World" looks around in a circle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to get all the fallen aristocrats of the Kingdom of Lun The information, including their current address, the more detailed the better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not directly mention Pound from the Baron, because of Sherlock Moriatti detective We are taking over the investigation of the underground construction of the Pound family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein does not want "justice" to clarify the identity of the "world." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot ignore every detail! He emphasized himself again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey heard a stunned look at the member of the end of the bronze long table and tried to ask:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"World" smirked and said: "You don't need to worry, I am just Looking for something that won’t hurt them, I can swear, witnessed by Mr. Fool’s.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Can restrain one's own body language... His profession is the nemesis of "audience" and "reader"? Audrey thought thoughtfully: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The information on the aristocratic, I know some, but not detailed enough, not specific enough, not comprehensive enough, I need to be certain It’s about three or four days to complete, can you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a nobleman, having knowledge of people at the same level is a compulsory course, and participating in various At the ball, banquet, and salon, Audrey always hears interesting stories, but it is fragmented and difficult to form. After all, she is not an expert in researching this aspect. She also needs to turn books, inquire and check. Information to fill in the details, and not to miss a broken aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." "The world" smiled lowly. "There is what you want to get paid. What I can pay now is: some secrets of the Quaternary History, knowledge about certain extraordinary ways, and several recipes, but frankly, I don't think that the things that broke the nobility can be equivalent to the potion recipes of Sequence 8, Sequence 7, if you ask for something else I will try to finish it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formula of Sequence 8 and Sequence 7 is not equivalent, that is, I can't ask a "psychologist" "The corresponding request ... "justice" Audrey seriously thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, she quietly glanced at the top of the old long table, Mr. "fool", hoping to get a hint, and she found that "fool" There is no reaction in the fog, just like the gods are watching the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay...Audrey finally made a decision, smiling:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I want to hear about some extraordinary ways, but only if I don't know them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, can you judge? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes," Klein replied plainly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we communicate alone." Audrey looked to the "world." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein tapped the table and isolated the sight and hearing of the "sun" and "downside down". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately nodded to the trumpet, indicating that it is now in a state of separate communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"World" looks at Miss "Justice", using a consistent hoarse voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What do you know about the witch sect?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey recalled the last time he spent 1,000 pounds to buy from the "downside" Alger, there is Short answer to the alert: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know what they believe in, which era they originated, what extraordinary ways they have, and what tendencies the top has."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"World" hoarse laughter:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand, you don't know much." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The witch sect holds the 'Assassin' route, and the sequence 8 is the 'teacher'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is clear to me." Audrey is half reminded that half is looking forward to Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The World" raised his hand and touched the chin:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you know the corresponding What is the sequence 7?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey shakes his head very small: "I am happy to hear from you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sequence 7 of the 'Assassin' route is called 'Witches'." The "World" is concise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witch?" Audrey was shocked by this word, and there was a natural association in her mind. "If, if the male took this Potions, how do you play?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing a beautiful dress, drawing a delicate look, imitating a lady every move? She is a little disgusting and inexplicably feels interesting and whispers in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, 'Justice', when a man takes this potion, he can't be called a man, he has become a real lady. Klein endured the impulsive impulse to manipulate the "world" answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Goddess, ‘Witches’ potions can change a person’s gender?” Audrey blurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, this is really imaginable! Mr. "Folly" did not make a negative, the explanation is true! This is a miracle! This is the mysterious and extraordinary world, this is the world full of all kinds of incredible things! This is the world I yearn for! I, why am I a little excited... After a little calmer, Audrey quickly and guiltyly looked at the "fool" Mr., and confessed to the name of the goddess of the night before him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"World" low dumb way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but only for men to become Women, women will increase their own charm accordingly, regardless of long compatibility or skin condition, will be significantly better on the basis of the original, this is the reason why the top of the witch sect is female."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What disadvantages does it have?" Audrey suddenly felt heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "World" screams unsatisfactorily and slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The requirement is that Become an evil person who brings disasters, diseases and pains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey spit a little and was slightly disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her thoughts turned very quickly and immediately had new doubts:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If, I mean, if there is an animal taking the 'Witch' potion and not dead or out of control, does its glamour increase mean becoming a human being, or increasing the appeal of its own race? For example, one makes all male cats love The cats are crazy to like the female cat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world" did not know how to answer, after a few seconds:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not studied this kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaiting Audrey again, he added:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sequence 6 of the 'Witches' is 'Happy', also known as the Happy Witch, and the requirement is to bring joy to men and women, mainly in that respect. And with this control or influence them, this sequence of witches is very good at using strange spider silk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey opened his beautiful mouth, Immediately and silently The land is closed, and I regret deeply about my longing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Knowing this knowledge, you will be able to effectively distinguish the witch in the future, huh, are you satisfied with this reward?" "World" asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey gently slammed the first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is very helpful to me, um... ...the deal is reached, I will help you collect the information of the fallen aristocrats as soon as possible, and give it to you at the next meeting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "world" has fallen into the air:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can it be as soon as possible?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Then I will give it to Mr. Fool’s when I collect it, and ask him to give it to you, Mr. Fool’s, can you?” Audrey asked sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein in the rich fog nodded and agreed. At the same time, he is very busy manipulating the "world" whisper: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a problem with different products of personal pronouns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the "world" is different, Audrey's mouth is slightly tilted, his eyes are turned up, and he did not explain it intentionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein knocked on the bronze long table, indicating that the individual exchange ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he manipulated the "world" again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still have a question." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newcomer has accumulated a lot of demand... Audrey did not accidentally look at the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger and "Sun" Dairik also have body language to express their listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The World" is dumb:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to know the Soren family of Intis Is there a high sequence strong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the "world" is talking, Klein swept the "sun" with the corner of his eye and found the boy No additional reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the probability of Silver City is not recorded by the Sauron family... This family has mostly risen after the Cataclysm... Klein thoughtfully looks around I found that "justice" and "upside down people" looked at each other and obviously did not know the answer, and the "sun" was undoubtedly silent and silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he tapped the table again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This question, I will answer, you What kind of remuneration can I pay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not fallen, and Klein has quickly manipulated the "world" opening:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"One recipe, one recipe for sequence 7."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, deal." Klein creates a separate communication environment, and own The trumpet was silent for a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blocked "justice" Audrey and "downside down" Alger once again felt the unfathomableness of Mr. "The Fool", they all have some answers Curious, but I don't think it's useful for myself. It's not worthwhile to exchange the equivalent of the 7 potions recipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the individual exchange ended, Klein deliberately let the "world" go for a ceremony, hoarse and deaf: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mr. Dear Mr., thank you for your answers, this is very helpful to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is an equivalent exchange, no thanks Klein replied with a sudden goose bump, a tone of indifference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free exchange after the maintenance lasted less than ten minutes, he announced that the Tarot would end here, and then cut off with the crimson stars contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until the "justice", "upside down" and "sun" figure disappeared, Klein looked to the opposite "world", chuckled One channel: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the trumpet, many things are really convenient."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It's just that the black eyes can't be used outside the fog, but it's a pity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he manipulated the "world" and got up. A ceremony, then let it melt into the magnificent palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he had to distract himself from the trumpet, Klein’s spiritual consumption was very high. He did not stay in this space and took off the “Eye of All Blacks”. After putting it on the surface of the bronze long table, he immediately returned to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
