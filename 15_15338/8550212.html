			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of sight swept, Klein saw the person who asked about the fangs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is less than 1 meter away from him, wearing a black formal suit, a half-high hat with the same color, a silver-plated cane in the palm, and a gold-rimmed frame glasses on the face. The temperament is quite Sven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, do you need it? This small can of 3 Sule." The stall owner wore a dark black robe with a mysterious character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corners are pale yellow, and the inquirer of the glasses Sven thought about the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I still have to buy other materials, such as the white-edged sunflower petals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stall owner thought for a few seconds and replied reluctantly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2 Sule 6 pence, I think you can no longer find a cheaper price than this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The man who saw the gold-rimmed glasses not only bought the fangs, but also bought the white-edged sunflowers and other materials, and Klein felt that he seemed to think too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he carefully tapped his eyebrows and swept the other side with Ling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem, the body is very healthy, the mood is not bad, sir, you have to keep it... Klein took back the line of sight, turned the body, and looked back at selling the homemade amulet Booth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his pupil, the amulets are clearly presented, in sterling silver, iron, and gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these two or three of these amulets have a weak gas field color, or blush, or pale, or golden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that they are initially spiritual, indicating that these amulets have a role! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that time, Klein looked very carefully and confirmed that the owner of the homemade amulet had a certain mystery: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no errors in the different sources of power he has chosen for different spells, and the corresponding materials identified for different sources of power are quite correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, pure occult enthusiasts will definitely have some omissions, and Klein finds that the stall owner doesn’t know much about the curse, not according to Hermes. The grammar of the language, which translates the content of the petition, can be regarded as a mantra. The mantra must conform to a certain format and have unique laws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem is that when the stall owner is a mantra and chooses the appropriate symbol for the "source of power", there are also different degrees of error, so that dozens of Only two or three pieces of the amulet are completely correct, emitting "light". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the extent to which these two pieces can be achieved, Klein can only say that there is better than nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real amulet with obvious effect requires the creator to sculpt the spirituality from the tip of the knife in the process of carving the mantra and the symbol! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want better results, you must use ritual magic to assist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two things are not extraordinary and almost impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein knocked on his eyebrows with a black cane and clicked on the top left corner of the stall:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is the two pieces?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not asking for the amulets that initially have the color of the gas field, but the semi-finished products, only the shape, not yet Semi-finished sculptures of engravings and symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Klein, there is absolutely no need to buy the few pieces that are weak, and it is his purpose to make semi-finished products into real amulets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, give Benson and Melissa each a talisman to avoid trouble... My own can depreciate the materials provided by the Night Squad... Hey, I was not broken by the old Neil. I don’t think there is any feeling of guilt about this kind of thing... Kline’s thoughts diverged and looked at the stall owner’s picking up the two-and-a-half silver sacs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the appearance party, Klein can be said to have seen them at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This 6 Sule." The stall owner is a reticent middle-aged man who points to the more refined one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meal, he rubbed the simple one:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This 5 Sule 3 Penny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's too expensive, in fact, they are still far away from the amulet." Klein was accustomed to Benson and Melissa everyday, getting used to it. Bargaining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a verbal battle, he bought the two pieces of silver at the price of 5 Sule 6 pence and 4 Sule 9 pence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, for the time being, it’s only silverware... Klein thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this 10 Sule 3 pence was deducted from the divination club fund (5 pounds) he finally received. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein took two pieces of silverware and smashed into the pocket, when he planned to go to another booth, he suddenly heard a soft, green voice: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Why don't you buy the finished amulet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned and looked and found The inquirer was a fifteen-six-year-old girl, wearing a long yellow dress with lace and a satin ribbon hat in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I am going to make my own amulet, you know, this is the wish of every occultist." Klein euphemistically replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not want the stall owner to think that he is going to grab the business, although he has also considered whether to rely on this "craft" to earn some extra money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl has long brown hair with natural curls, and the baby fat on her face is quite cute. She looks at Klein with a light blue scorpion, sincerely asks :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can ask you how to choose amulets? Well, I was brought here by friends, I have been there a few times, I feel very much about mystery. Interest, but not enough to understand, um, she, my friend will be sixteen years old after a while, I want to pick a talisman for her, because the hope is a surprise, so I did not find her... I I have been consulted in advance, but many key points can't be recalled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gentleman smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of amulet do you want to pick? Avoid the affliction? Stay away from the disease? Can you have money to transport? Different requirements correspond to different sources of power, that is, different gods, and different gods Corresponding to different stars, different stars correspond to different materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the mantra that avoids the affliction must belong to the Empress and the fearful queen, which is the goddess of the night. As a occultile lover, we all know that the symbol of the goddess of the night is the moon, and the metal corresponding to the moon is sterling silver."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, if we want to avoid the affliction, then it is best to pick a silver amulet with the corresponding spell."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the language of the mantra is correct, the format is correct, the corresponding symbol of the "Evil and Fear Queen", the number of the representative, the spell logo, etc. are correct, the positional relationship between each other is also correct... ...but this is too complicated, there is no need to tell you... Klein silently added in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl was so stunned and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" As a goddess believer, can you wear other gods' amulets?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, the gods will not care about this little thing." Klein calmed the other side. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His no problem refers to the wearer, and the producer must be careful, if the believer of the storm master is to make the amulet of the eternal sun, then most will Harvested a lot of malicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this refers to the kind of ritual magic that needs to be produced, and the others don't have to care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope to be a healthy amulet to bless her. Which god should I choose? Eternal Sun, Mother Earth, or God of Knowledge and Wisdom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Eternal blazing sun and the earth god god have no problem, the former corresponds to the sun, the latter is the brown star." Klein said with a smile, "The material of the sun is gold, the metal of brown star is lead, I suggest to choose the sun." Just don't know if you have enough money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he suggested this is because there are three amulets in the initial aura, one is the sun field. Health talisman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not..." The girl said that she suddenly stopped and watched the silently waiting stall owner with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought about it and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Determining the material, what should I do? Identify the spells and symbols?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know Hermes?" Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just touched for a while." The girl replied not too embarrassedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will help you choose." Klein pointed his hand at the gold-made health talisman. "No matter the mantra, or the symbol, it is There is no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl took the skirt and squatted down, picked up the health talisman with the sun-lined edge, only feels warm and the body It seems to have been relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, thank you." She stood up again and thanked her for a ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein haha ​​smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next step is communication between you, me There are other things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the conversation, he looked at the owner and found that the other person’s eyes were very strange and seemed to hesitate to give him a kickback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sneer, Klein didn’t take care of this matter again, and he turned around the entire underground trading market without hesitation, and found no real extraordinary material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the old Neil had already finished the bill and still had a dark wooden box in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Klein’s confused eyes, he pointed to another room in the end:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “If you want to buy, or want to sell extraordinary materials, go there. After all, no one wants to know what extraordinary items they have bought.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein seemed to nod in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no past needs for the time being, and he walks with the old Neil to the underground trading market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much do these elves spend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a voice of inquiry was introduced into the gram Ryan's ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf flower... This is also the recipe material for the "audience" potion... Klein’s heart moved, looking sideways and seeing the gold side again Sven man with eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Old Neal asked with a little doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing." Klein regained his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is an associate member of the Night Squad, he does not feel that all the extraordinary people must be absorbed and detained, believing this must be determined by the circumstances. Among them, the "audience" is definitely a type of society that does not harm the kingdom to the world, and the possibility that the sequence 9 is out of control is also very low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the Dragon Bar, Klein and the Old Neil The carriage left the dock area and then separated in the north, returning to their respective homes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
