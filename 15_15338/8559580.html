			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real Creator"? The proverb that floods this sea comes from the "real creator"? When I heard the answer given by the "Mysterious Queen," Klein was surprised and grateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is fortunate that, as the "mysterious queen" said, if she did not board the ship, even if there were seals that reduced hearing in all senses, Heath. It is also hard for Doyle not to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the middle and low sequencers of other channels, if you don’t directly hear the “real creator” slang, at most, you will be depressed or arrogant, and occasionally Nightmare, will not suffer obvious damage, but in the "Bishop of Rose", the sequence 0 of his path is "real creator", has been shackled in the slang of this evil spirit, even if I am a deaf person, sooner or later . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Heath Doyle went crazy or out of control, the rest of the boat was really hard to escape, but Klein believed that as long as it could After a surprise attack, I have the opportunity to pray to the "fool" and go to the fog to respond with the Poseidon scepter, or solve the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is surprised that the owner of the proverb is totally contradictory of his own guess. He originally thought that this sea area was the second century ancient gods and the worship of Silver City. The battlefield of the Creator, suspected that the dependent gods are also the corresponding angels, and who knows, this seems to be wrong from the starting point, because the "real creator" first appeared before and after the Cataclysm of the Third Age! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not rule out the proverb is the possibility of the legacy... Klein did not blindly judge, watching the "mysterious queen" over himself, rubbing the sculpture on the armrest, slow Go down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady’s back is tall, fat and thin, and her body is very good. The long hair of maroon is simply draped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Klein feel familiar, and after recalling the incident involving the "mysterious queen", he finally remembered the source of familiarity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a similar back when he visited the Russell Memorial, and the back was dressed quite strangely, wearing a girlish yellow cake skirt. But wearing a very old black bonnet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be the 'mysterious queen', she also visited the Russell Memorial Exhibition in advance... She was watching the basic education improved by the Great Emperor for their children. Textbooks, invented chess and building blocks... she is convinced that I took the 'Black Emperor' card...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The eldest daughter of the great emperor Bernardin created" The element dawn ', against the 'Moss assassination', and from the diary, the lady appreciates the motto of 'do whatever you want, but don't hurt', so from these two points, it can be inferred that her big probability is 'the voyeur 'The half-god of the route...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sequence of 'the voyeur' is 4 'mystician'... 'mysterious queen'... Of course, 'mystery The Queen’s reputation has been proclaimed for hundreds of years in the sea, and she is certainly more than just sequence 4, um, after Jia Delia left the 'mysterious queen', she joined the 'Moss assassination meeting'...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Queen is very concerned about whether she can interpret Russell's diary..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Various pieces of piecemeal information are intertwined, and Klein Horan has a guess: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, the "mysterious queen" is the eldest daughter of Russell the Great. Bernard Gustav!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may explain why the Queen’s dress is earthy but quite strange, she is here by the emperor The influence of the aspect is very deep, and it is impossible to completely break away from the current trend of the times. Therefore, it combines a unique and bizarre self-style... As for the good looks, it is another matter, and the beautiful people have a sack. It’s good-looking and fashionable... Klein’s heart is voicing, but the surface is silent and restrained, and he follows the “mysterious queen” down the gorgeous staircase without hesitation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Queen did not look back and said as she walked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This dream world is not vast, only two parts, one is the giant Wang Ting projection on the opposite mountain, one is Black monastery here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Giant Wang Ting? Klein’s mind emerged as a magnificent group of buildings standing in the solidified evening.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the little "sun" they are really the entrance of the "Giant Wang Ting", the afternoon town! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Mysterious Queen" softly but without feelings said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is mine Guess, because it is very similar to Fossack's Dusk Hall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And in the Quaternary, there have been rumors that the God of War is big The ancient giant who survived the disaster. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "God of War" approach is the "giant" approach... Klein expressed his approval for the "mysterious queen" in his heart.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he remembered the small "Sun" provided in the mythological information, the description of "Giant Wang Ting" has the sentence "always in the dusk", this and the opposite mountain peak The characteristics of the spectacle coincide.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the "real creator" to the current "giant Wang Ting", the Queen revealed two extremely valuable information... She is showing me goodwill to me, no, to the person behind me, huh, I am behind me... Klein calmly responds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 'Giant Wang Ting' is in the 'land of God'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke this thing with a less careful tone in order to highlight his own value and highlight the person behind him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Mysterious Queen" stopped at the same place, the right palm pressed on the armrests covered with gorgeous sculptures, half-turned, looking towards German Sparrow, not too fast Said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The road to rumored to the land of the gods, is hidden in the opposite mountain, hidden in the projection of the 'Giant Wang Ting'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the little "sun" they started exploring the afternoon town? And the little Jack is not saying that they are at the seaside? "Giant Wang Ting" and "Giant King" There are switches in the projections of the court. They must be opened in advance to allow the two sea areas to connect.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a slogan of "real creator" and hides " The secret of the land of God, the power of the night, the sun, the storm, the earth, and the audience, seems to be able to correspond to the Cataclysm!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;大After the catastrophe, the "land of God's abandonment" was isolated from the outside world. The goddess, the eternal sun, the master of the storm, the goddess of the earth, and the salvation of the world, the 'real creator' appeared... only the illusion of the "audience" approach is not right... ... Klein made speculation based on the information currently available.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Mysterious Queen" continued to descend, and said: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The black monastery here does not look big, but every building in every building has TABLE different places of this sea, perhaps after each door is hidden in a creature of dreams. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way... Klein glanced at the stair railing and found that the sculpture above was dominated by the human head, which looked rough and gorgeous, so he Asked casually: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whose dream is this staircase? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A non-dead person of the Spiritual Regiment, he came here to look for traces of the death of the past, which is one of the necessary elements of artificial death, but Losing control in proverbs, always lingering in an underwater ruin, transforming every venturer who dares to enter into a living corpse belonging to him. "The mysterious queen" explained plainly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god war that broke out here, the god of death also participated? No wonder "Hell Admiral" enters this sea adventure from time to time... Klein was amazed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not shocked by the artificial death, because he had listened to the "not old witch" Katerina Pellet. And the spiritual group seems to be far from success.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "mysterious queen" just finished the ladder and looked back at him.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the lady turned to the corridor and entered the building.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked around And found that there is no further ladder, it seems to be the bottom.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
