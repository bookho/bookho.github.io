Daniz suddenly awake from confusion and chaos and grasped the focus of the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed his head down, not letting his eyes reveal his own surprises and sorrows. The adventurers next to <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continue to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible? No one dares to go Collar!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, unless you want to endure the anger of the storm church, or sell Galman Sparo!”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"42,000 pounds... If you can get such a bounty, I will go to Beckland immediately and be a rich man!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, shouldn’t you enjoy the "Red Theater" for half a year?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe Greman Sparo can go The rewards of Intis, Fossack or Fenerbotten, although not as much as 42,000 pounds, are absolutely quite a few..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several adventurers spoke and began to imagine that they had a life of 42,000 pounds, even because of the disagreement, blushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No... They mean that German Sparrow has killed the "blood". No, although this madman has always had this idea, but lacks the necessary helper and needs to cooperate with the captain... Anderson Hood? Daniz stood up, held the cap, lowered his head, and hurried to the billiard room and the card room, where newspapers were often placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just left, the adventurers looked at his back, pressed his voice down and discussed with each other:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know him? Sneaking and shrinking, there is a problem at first glance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't see him clearly, But I think it should be a pirate, come to Baiam to inquire about intelligence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like..." An adventurer slashed his throat . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe we can't afford it, wait until this time has passed." Another adventurer stopped the actions of his companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz enters an empty billiard room, comes to the corner, picks up a stack of newspapers, and quickly flips it up. Gradually, his expression changes. It has to be a bit distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did the madman do? He really killed the 'blood on the top'? This is only a few months, his strength has been raised to this Degree! And, and there is no mention of Anderson Hood in the newspaper...” Daniz was surprised and grateful, and it was a very sensible thing to feel that he always chose to succumb to face in the face of German Sparrow. Otherwise, others have long seen him in the newspaper being hunted and replaced by a bounty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, at that time, my death was not eligible to be in the newspaper... Hey, Gelman Sparo is really an evil organization. Members... Thinking about it, Daniz suddenly sluggish and seems to have become a stone sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, he seems likely to be a member of that evil organization too...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, church And the military always likes to exaggerate the situation, um, it is a secret organization, not an evil organization!” Daniz himself comforted himself, and once again produced the unusually mysterious and powerful feeling behind the organization of German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior, one of the seven pirate generals, was proved to be hunting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call...Danizi breathed a sigh of relief and feared the "fool" in his heart and expressed his attitude of doing things seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small building near the Governor’s Mansion, Elland and Usk Kent came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally over..." Elland sighed and put the captain's cap on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usk Kent licked his nose, which turned red because of frequent drinking, and vomited with breath: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were quarantined for a full two days because of the problems of German Sparrow, facing the "interrogators" who are best at this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Elland has not concealed anything since the beginning. It is reported that the origin of German Sparrow is unknown, but he has goodwill to the military. It is a high-level decision to include this crazy adventurer in the ranks of the informant and investigate the corresponding background, and has nothing to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Usk Kent, there is no problem. Helping Greman Sparo to receive the bounty is what he should handle in the normal process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the road in the middle of the garden, slowly approaching the gate, Airland casually said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Who knows that Gilman Sparo will be so crazy, so powerful..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a small amount of information he has learned, killing "the blood will "It's just the most normal and small thing that Gilman Sparo did on the day." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And such a crazy guy, in order to save a few passengers and crew who only expressed his kindness to him, actually took the initiative to enter the dangerous Banxi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alanlan knew later that Banxi’s hidden horror far exceeded his imagination—the Storm Church actually destroyed it directly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I say to the interrogators that Gelman Sparrow has a soft, kind heart, they will definitely think that I am lying... People, really Contradictory aggregates... Airland shook his head silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the feelings of Airland, Usk Kent responded with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I At that time, I thought that you introduced only a more powerful adventurer. As a result, he even killed the 'blood on the top'! Damn, I even think he has the ability to become the fifth king, look at the woods, look Look at the nearby mountain, you will not doubt my statement!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is like, like..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aylan looked at Usk Kent and added to him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like being shelled by shore defense Hundreds of times. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Right! "Us Kent agrees with Airland's description.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two have stepped out of the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerlan looked at the starry night sky and the blushing but faint moon, quiet for a few seconds, and finished the collar collar:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope he will not return to the sea..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byiyam , 6 Sfeier Street.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denton, wearing a children’s formal suit, ran into the study and said to the sister who was practicing sketching:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Donna, they, they said Uncle Sparrow is a bad guy, a cultist, a murderer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, give me a newspaper!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna twisted her head, wrinkled The lower nose:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't believe!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Sparo is a justice , brave, kind adventurer, this is something we have seen with our own eyes, definitely more accurate than the newspaper! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hesitated, and then fluently said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although, although he has very Terrible and ugly, but that is the price of dreams and guardianship! Denton, you have to remember that those newspapers always like to make content based on some rumors and rumors. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm! "Denton focused on the head, "I have already passed them! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donna praised her brother and looked down at the window with her subconscious mind. She saw the gas street lamp spilling light into her garden, quiet, peaceful and soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilston District, an upscale hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein put a stack of folded white handkerchiefs into his left chest pocket and raised his hand to remove the half-height silk hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today will be the day when the mysterious rich Daun Don Tass officially appeared in public! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not wait for the bike company shares and the sale of magical items, ready to use the remaining 2,692 pounds to support the initial expenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more than enough, equivalent to the income of an upper middle class of six or seven years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last Mirror 'Arrows' last night did not enter my dreams, which means that it can't sense me without being in close contact. It’s a good thing to return to Beckland. Well, to contact the radio receiver tonight and ask about the evil spirits, then you don’t have to be so complicated.” Klein groaned in his heart and took a cane. , walked out of the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sun after the rain shines through the thin mist, so that people walking on the road can not help but feel better, Klein got on a carriage, straight The Metropolitan Helping Family Servant Association, located at 9 Canarowell Street in Jowood, prepares to hire an experienced butler and then organizes a servant team for a garden villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Metropolitan Helping Family Servant Association, Belin ended a conversation with a male colleague who spoke to her, and looked down at the lotus leaf dress. Two drops of black tea contaminated with water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, she had a mellow and heavy voice with a touch of sorrow:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Good morning, madam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beiling up her head and looking to the front of the reception desk, saw a gentleman of forty years old. The other is wearing a swallowtail dress made of silk, with a gold-plated cane in his hand and a third button on the clothing. There is a gold chain extending into the inner pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gentleman has a pair of deep blue eyes, the five senses are very eye-catching, even a little white hair on the horns looks very tasteful, he just smiles, just Let Belin suddenly feel that her face is hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., yes, what can I do for you? Ah, how do you call you?" Bellin got up in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dawn. Dontes." Klein gently smiled. "I want to hire a housekeeper, a good housekeeper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Tang Taisi, wait a moment, please sit down." Bellin was busy with Klein walking to the reception area and pointing her finger to a fabric sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a very light smile, did not urge, did not hesitate, sat down very patiently, waiting for the staff here to provide a list of butlers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s so demeanor...Oops, I forgot to ask him what he asked for! Bellin raised her hand and touched her cheeks: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Tang Taisi, what kind of housekeeper do you need?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has been prepared, and the voice replied: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is best to have served the aristocratic family."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This helps Dontes expand its network. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belin gradually recovered her expertise and said in detail:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of housekeeper It's rare, you know, aristocratic families rarely change their housekeepers unless they are unable to provide effective services, and even if they don't be housekeepers, they can take other positions within the aristocratic family.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, the wealthy businessmen are very eager for similar butlers and are willing to pay a premium salary. Mr. Dontes, we do have the type you need here, but the annual salary is at least More than 100 pounds. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
