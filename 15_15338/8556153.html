			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hungry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the almost nightmare, the little boy Jack raised his head Look at Joshua wearing red gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hungry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his mouth and continued to the ear. White Sensen's teeth are neatly arranged, and the slightly sticky saliva is constantly surging. At the same time, he rushed out and rushed to Joshua in front of him, leaving a broken image in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Joshua is highly alert, it is a bit unresponsive at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t even see the process, the little boy Jack rushed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow-haired figure seems to have hit an invisible wall, stopping at a step away from Joshua. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little boy Jack stuck in the air, his body emerged in the black and red light, irritating and blocking the transparent barriers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind Joshua and Dairik, "The Demon Hunter" Colin did not know when he had kneel on his knees and applied silver ash cream to his hands. Straight sword was inserted into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the area where the entire altar is located is instantly brightened, like the purest morning light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin suddenly pulled the sword, and the figure was divided and split, and the residual images that were formed into overlapping layers were distributed around the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then each figure lifted the sword in his hand and combined it with the nearby morning light to bloom brightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A straight handle spurs out, and the light of the morning rushes to gather, and the little boy Jack is surrounded in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun rises like a splendid, black and red figure quickly evaporates and annihilates in a storm-like attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the underground hall where the altar was located, the brilliance became very bright, and Dyke Berg couldn’t help but close his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his screamingly, woke up from his sleep, saw the fire burning in front of him and the team members who were guarding the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "hunter" Colin sitting cross-legged next to a stone pillar opened his eyes and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After 50 lightning strikes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Dairik looked up at the sky and found that the frequency of lightning was not obvious Ascension, darkness is still the master of this land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the city-state that is about to arrive, and thinking of the temple of the fallen creator, he is difficult to contain some tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After spending a certain amount of time to calm down, Deric quickly ate and recovered the state of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what will happen in that temple... He took the “Hurricane Axe” and came to the middle of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the camp, lanterns with thin skins were lit up one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 Minsk Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein burned hot water, adjusted the temperature, and took a bath comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the laziness after bathing, he took four steps back and entered the fog, intending to use divination to confirm the evil spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quiet and silent old palace, Klein leaned back on the back of the chair and seriously thought about the choice of divination method. How to design the divination statement, this must be It is in line with the principle of mystery and cannot be excluded from segmentation and must have sufficient information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief rest, Klein leaned forward and showed off the paper and wrote what he wanted to confirm:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evil spirits in the ruins are for me. And Sharon had a strong malice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlocking the left wrist, Klein held his hand and began to meditate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After repeated low thoughts, he opened his eyes and looked ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the Citrine Pendant is spinning wildly in a clockwise direction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that the evil spirit of the evil spirit is even stronger than what Klein originally thought! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, my spiritual intuition with Miss Sharon was nothing wrong... The evil spirit was also a strong interfering with divination and prophecy... Oh, he certainly couldn’t think of it. We have a desire for restraint, we will not be blinded by greed, one has experienced too many things, knowing what is called "thinking with the tiger"... Klein sighed, returned to the real world, and fell into the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the heat brought by the "sun brooch" is only a psychological feeling, can not warm the bed ... before going to sleep, he closed his eyes, regretted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South Bridge, Rose Garden, Harvest Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White wiped the last chair, straightened up, and couldn’t wait to see Utovsky’s father:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have done what I am today!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damn old man, don't make me want to copy the holy book again! Emlin subconsciously prayed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the object of his prayer has unconsciously changed from the moon to the earth goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Uttraski stood there, lined up with a vampire like a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have recently experienced dedication and gratitude The joy and relaxation of the heart labor, go back, quietly feel the pulse of life itself, and the pure joy that comes from it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did not! "Emlin refuted the condition." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Uttraski smiled at him with a smile and said nothing, turned his body, found a position to sit down and started every night. Fixed prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin. White's lips are swaying, wanting to refute, but in the end there is no opening, silently left the harvest church, and habitually grabbed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the current residence, he found that the house was deserted and his parents disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, he remembered that there was a bloody gathering in the Beckland area tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guys are really decent, as a noble blood family should sleep in the coffin, or stay in their own room, why imitate humans, Hold a variety of parties? Even dance!" Emlin whispered two words in a contemptuous manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;talking, he touched his stomach, swallowed and decided to change clothes to attend the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Odra family is really enviable. There are pure human partners. There are several hospitals, and every day there is fresh blood. What do you think? When you drink, drink when you want to drink, and drink as much as you want." Emlin put on a tall black top hat and walked out of the house quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western District, a brightly lit villa-style house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin picked up a glass of scarlet liquid and took a sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, it was chosen... He closed his eyes and was very impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in the dance floor, a beautiful man and woman danced in the romantic music, and sometimes circled and walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What does this mean?” Emlin stood on the edge of the railing on the second floor, overlooking the family below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the largest city in the world, Beckland lives a lot of vampires, who are hidden in all walks of life and thoroughly integrated into human society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those who can’t resist the destruction and bloodthirsty desires, they are not sent to the castle in the mountains, they are solved in advance, so as to avoid the night. Official and extraordinary organizations such as punitives and punishers find clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin looked at the same family who was more and more spiritual at night, and felt that they did not have a common language with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the host of the banquet tonight, Kasimi Odra came over with a glass of wine and smiled and asked: <br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you like the 'wine' tonight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, its owner is young enough to have a good Vitality." Emlin straightened his back and put on a noble posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the outside, Kasimi Odra is a very temperamental middle-aged gentleman, but Emlin knows that he is over two hundred years old. Intis, who had witnessed the rule of Russell under the rule of Intis, was later moved to Lun because he had "lived" for too long and was afraid of being found wrong by the neighbors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the comments of Emlin, he smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it The owner was a young girl who was stabbed by a thief and almost lost her life. Fortunately, she met me, and this is the necessary price she paid for her recovery.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can taste the next side, there is wine on the other side, their owners come from Byron and Fenetport, which have different flavors. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fenerport? Goddess, the humans there are so fond of peppers that the blood is so hot that I can't stand it, mother god..." Emlin said, suddenly paused, his expression was sluggish.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kasimi’s mouth twitched and pretended not to hear anything.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;尴尬的静, He cleared his throat: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Emlin, that's just your illusion, yes, my grandfather wants to see you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your grandfather? "Emlin was a glimpse, and immediately opened his eyes," said Nibes? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nibes. Odra is a powerful blood group active in the Quaternary, but the long years have made his life decay, have to Lying in a cold coffin for a long time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cassimi Zheng focus:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he turned to the other step on the second floor, did not consider the possibility of Emlin's disagreement.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin is somewhat cramped and uneasily behind, thinking about the purpose of the call of Nibes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I finally understood that the honor of the blood family was more important. I decided to help me to remove the psychological hints of Father Uttravsky. As I walked, Emlin White had a strong hope.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the stairs, after coming to the underground area, Emlin White went through a few secret doors and entered a spacious grey hall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The center of the hall is filled with a heavy black iron-like plaque, engraved with many symbolic symbols and magic signs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casimier After Laihui reported, there was a deep and old voice coming out of the room:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Emlin White, you know why I want to summon You ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Mr. Nibes, I think you are planning to help me remove my psychological cues. Emlin responded without hesitation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground hall suddenly became silent, after a few seconds, lying in the coffin of Nibes. Dra laughed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
