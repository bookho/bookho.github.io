			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are guardians and a group of poor people who are always fighting against danger and madness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The corridor outside the window was closed, the stone wall was cold, the light in the house was shining, and the light was bright and yellow. Dunn Smith’s retelling in this environment was awkward, and he knocked on Klein’s heart and made him unable to speak for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Klein silently, Dunn shook his head and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it very disappointing? Extraordinary It's not the same as you think, we've been walking with danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is definitely a price to get it." Klein has just been shocked. Peace, answer with a tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not expect the extraordinary person to be glorious, supernormal, different from the ordinary side, and there are such hidden dangers, but perhaps because only the description is heard, not yet Really encountered, or perhaps because it has been involved in this whirlpool, maybe when there are strange events falling on his body, his fears, jealousy, fear and fear will soon be reduced to a degree that can be controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the emergence of retreating thoughts is inevitable, entangled, and refused to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, very mature, very sensible..." Dunn finished the rest of the coffee and added, "And, the extraordinary Not as powerful as you think, the extraordinary of low sequences, oh, why use 1 for the highest grade and 9 for the lowest? This is too counterintuitive and logical, we usually say low sequence, low The order, the high number, is the beginning of the sequence chain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, what did I just say? Yes, the extraordinary is not like you think It’s so powerful, the 'power' of the low-sequence extraordinary is not as good as the gun, let alone the artillery, but in some respects, it’s more wonderful than the gun, and it’s harder to guard against it. If you have the chance to become an extraordinary person in the future, be sure to These words I am talking about today should be considered clearly and not recklessly chosen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein laughed at himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I don't know when I have a chance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is this opportunity, he You won't miss it. Taking the wrong potion and the more potion can be avoided to the utmost extent. The main hidden danger lies in the subtle influence of the potion itself and the unknown that you hear and see after the inspiration is raised. "Danger". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former has a generation of ancestors' experience reference, as long as the focus is not on the rise, steady and steady control of the power, the probability of losing control should be relatively low, and it is mainly In order to solve the current potential danger, understand the essence of occultism, find a way to go back, and then go out of this step, not aiming at the "position" of high sequence. If it is easy to get out of control, it will not be promoted if it is too big, stay in the original sequence, rely on knowledge. Plan to "go home." <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hidden dangers behind it, not to mention, Klein’s whispers of the whispers that make him close to madness and whose heads are about to explode when using the “transportation ceremony” are still fresh. It is not that you can avoid it without becoming an extraordinary person. In this case, it is better to grasp the power that can be confronted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein only felt that the pros and cons were so clear that the thoughts of retreating in the heart disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den picked up the pipe again, and the gray eyes smiled slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I can't answer this question accurately. If you want to be an extraordinary person, you can get enough credit. Maybe you can interpret the key ancient documents tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, or provide very useful opinions for our case? Second, if there are any new ideas on it, no one can say this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I think you should know more about the extraordinary, in the future. I will not be impulsive to make a choice. Now I will introduce you to the civilian work of our Night Club."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and walked to the door, pointing The opposite direction of the “Chanis Gate”: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We have an accountant, one responsible for purchasing the necessary items, receiving supplies from the church and the police, and part-time drivers. People, they are professionals, do not need to rotate, rest every Sunday, the remaining three civilians, is Luo Shan, Wright and Old Neil, their work includes: receiving visitors, cleaning up the room, writing case documents and item declaration lists, as well as guarding weapons, materials and literature libraries, strictly entering and receiving and returning registrations, each person taking a week off each week. In addition to Sunday, there is also a rotation of the night and rest, all of which are negotiated by themselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you don't need it, you are a professional." Dunn smiled and said, "You have two things at the moment. First, every morning or afternoon, go out and take a walk. The focus is on Welch's residence. Every road of your home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Klein looked awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this "work"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are professional? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun's hands are inserted into the pockets of the black trench coat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Confirm that you are really missing the memory After that, Welch and Naya’s case was over. Similarly, the diary of the Antignus family was completely gone. We suspect that you left with it and hide it on the way home. So we didn't find any clues in your home, this should be why you are not at the scene, but the possible reason for 'suicide' at home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although you have been mysteriously influenced and completely forgotten this memory, but the human spirit and brain are wonderful, and there may be some traces left. Dai Li can't get it with the means of 'Psychic', it doesn't mean they don't exist. Perhaps in a familiar place, in a key place, you will see what you seem to have seen and what you seem to have done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what we want. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understood." Klein suddenly realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night-time inferences about the whereabouts of the diary are indeed reasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the people present at the time, only they are still alive, and only have their own time and "motivation" to take away the diary, hiding in the middle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can find the diary in this way, you should get enough credit to be an extraordinary person." Dunn Smith motivated one sentence, indirectly revealing that This diary is still important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hope." Klein nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun turned the topic back:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second, you take a day off every week For the time being, you can decide for yourself which day, when you are not outside, go to the arsenal and read the documents and classics we have saved. This is the work of historical professionals. When they have finished reading, they will rotate with the old Neil. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, no problem." Klein quietly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not too difficult...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Dunn turned half, Pointing at the black iron that is engraved with seven holy emblems, the door is open:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the 'Channis' door, from the modern night system The founder, the name of Archbishop Chanis, has a single underground church in every big city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is rotated by a formal member of the night club There are at least two 'caretaker' inside the church, and countless traps. Don't get close to it, or you will get bad luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Sounds great." Klein gave a speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is divided into several areas, which contain a certain sequence of potion recipes and various magical materials, temporarily holding heretics, heterogeneous, cults and secrets. Organization members, huh, they will eventually be sent to the church." Dunn introduced casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Church? Located at the headquarters of the Goddess Church in Winter County, north of the Kingdom, "Quiet Church"? Klein seemed to nod in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, there are a variety of high-density copies of the literature, so that when your authority is improved, you may have the opportunity to read." Dunn indulged Again, "At the bottom of the 'Channis', there are some seals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seal?" Klein chewed the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
