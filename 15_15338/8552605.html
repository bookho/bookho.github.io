			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On June 3, after discussing with Edwards, I gave up the idea of ​​reaching a tacit agreement with the Church of Eternal Sun, which is likely to reveal my true intentions. Let the Sauran family and the old nobles who support them notice in advance and carry out targeted arrangements, which will become very difficult and dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Green died in the foggy sea. He is the smartest of us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chaos, mess! Only when it is completely messed up, I can get The opportunity to fish in troubled waters! Only the Sauron family can no longer clean up the situation, the eternal sacred church can hold my nose and admit me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should probably give those rebellions The party has some help, but how can it be hidden and how can it be undetectable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On June 4th, the Charattu secret of the secret meeting came to visit I am very sudden."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is wondering that Charatu, the leader of the Secret Society, was looking for Russell on the eve of the rebellion and coup, and found that the subsequent two pages of notes were irrelevant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him have to create an uncomfortable annoyance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these three diaries do not have too many detailed descriptions, but the parties are flat, but still let Klein feel 1173, that is, more than 100 Years ago, the famous event in Intis was raging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The historical textbook clearly recorded the results. The identity of Russell’s school reconciled the rebellion, the coup d’état, the change of the Kingdom of Intis to the Republic, and the ruling official. In the 19 years since he reformed the Code, he encouraged inventions, escorted the industrial revolution, greatly enhanced his national strength, and levied the Northern War, and he would return to Rumburg, Ma Xi, Segal and other countries have been included in the protection, so that the three northern powers of the Fossac Empire, the Kingdom of Lun and the Kingdom of Fenetport have bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the 20th year of the governor, at the end of 1192, Russell changed the Republic to an empire, calling himself Caesar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less than six years later, he fell to the White Maple Palace, ending the most legendary history of the Fifth Age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein recalls the information he has seen, and he feels that Russell’s death is definitely not as simple as the surface, just like this famous event There must be an extraordinary force, and the rebalancing of extraordinary forces will not be the same as the description of the textbook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Green, one of Russell’s so-called 'Apocalypse Four Knights', died in the foggy sea... In a diary before, Russell recorded The 'Knight' is not right, it seems to have something to do with the island where they found many superb creatures...not only an adventure, but also a danger..." Klein associates with a previous record. I turned to the fifth page diary with emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of this page is of little value. They are the reviews of Russell’s 1128 Olmer red wine, and admiration when he was young. The result of the object was found to be the disillusionment of the lady's aging appearance, and the fall of the game that was indulged in playing cards for some time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth page is almost the same as everyday, but the last one makes Klein shine:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"On April 8th, I had to send someone to investigate the secrets and get more information. I can’t repeat the previous passiveness, and I can’t be led by Charato.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, have you found anything, Comrade Russell? Klein couldn't find the follow-up content, only forced to calm down, waiting for the other six pages that will be submitted by the "downside down" at the next party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that most of the survey data more than a hundred years ago could not help him find clues related to the secret conference. After all, such a long time passed, except for the more special ones. Those, many high-sequence strong people are probably dead, not to mention the middle and low-level members, but Klein believes that this can help them get inspiration and master the clear identity and activity rules that the close-up will use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, in the diary just now, Russell the Great had a description: "Create all the Lord, the omnipotent God", which is very close to the habit of Silver City. Where did he hear it? The oldest and most secretive organization that secretly manipulates the world situation? Was this organization born before the "land of gods" was born? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well... Suddenly, Klein had a new idea and smiled in a low and peaceful manner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Russell mentioned some hidden history in the diary and mentioned some simple common sense. The latter reminds me of it. I don't seem to have told you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey suddenly stunned, and then turned half-turned body, surprised to look at the top of the ancient long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Footer" takes the initiative to mention the contents of Russell's diary? What will be recorded above? She was excited and excited, completely forgetting that she was a "audience." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with her, "After hanging people" Alger will be much more stable, but he does not consciously straighten his back, still mercilessly betrayed him . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the "Sun" Dairik has always thought that the items of interest to Mr. Fool must contain many mysteries, but he does not know Russell the Great, do not know What does this name mean in the Northern Continent, so it is only difficult to hide curiosity, and there is no abnormal performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool's, what common sense did Russell mention? I can pay for this news." Audrey couldn't help but ask. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I ask for a separate exchange! She silently added a sentence in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein chuckles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, this is simple common sense "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Seeing this part of the diary, as the convener of the Tarot Society, I think it is inevitable that you all know, of course, I know very well, you Some people have already mastered it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mainly refers to the "sun", the history of Silver City has two or three thousand years, it is impossible to find the law of extraordinary characteristics . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, they are in a relatively extreme environment, even if the surrounding area does not lack the monsters in the dark, but sometimes, it may not be able to get the desired correspondence. The materials, for the inheritance, for the continuation of the whole city, the use of the extraordinary characteristics of the forensic remains to make potions is not particularly unacceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For them, this may still be a sacred glory ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, from the previous answer, Klein can see that "upside down" also knows something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, you can’t always let Miss Justice to pay the gold pound and transfer the money to my leader... my leader is also forced to ... can not destroy the image of the strong man created by Mr. Azick... Well, there is a chance to try again. After all, there is a strong existence, there will be subordinates of the bottom errands, just like the "sleeper" of the goddess of the night... No one will suspect that the night goddess is not the true god because of the weakness of the underlying night. Klein silently sighed a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you so much! Mr. "The Fool" is so generous!" Audrey responded with delight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She repented for three seconds for the vulgarity she had just wanted to buy money with money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stopped his fingers and said in a plain tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first Common sense, the extraordinary characteristic of immortality, extraordinary characteristics will not be destroyed, will not be reduced, just transfer from one thing to another."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know it With the captain's tone... Klein's mouth is subconscious and tilted up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will not destroy, not reduce, just transfer from one thing to another... Audrey chewed the description of Mr. "fool" and thought it was simple In one sentence, it contains too much meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
