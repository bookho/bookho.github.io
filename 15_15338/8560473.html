			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon silenced for two seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will help you ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meaning is that you have to think about it? Also, the negative effect of "Lucky Balance" is indeed hesitant. However, "biotoxin bottle" and "resentment" are really very good. If it is not lack of money, and carrying it will make the body worse and worse, infected with disease. I am reluctant to sell, in the ambush, it is quite useful! Klein vaguely grasped the meaning of Sharon and stuffed the silver necklace with ancient coins back into the collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked at his discretion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let every inanimate object around attack target 'Prisoner' ability to route high sequences?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Puppet." Sharon succinctly returned a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability of the sequence 4 "puppet"? It becomes a "lifeless" doll, so it can manipulate all inanimate objects within a certain range. Going up again, will it directly affect the enemy's magical items? Klein turned his head and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know such a demigod?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed in detail the appearance of the old man who attacked himself outside Baiyam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jacks." Sharon calmly said a name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I hope that you can introduce more relevant information... Klein knows the style of Miss Sharon, but helplessly laughs:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know Zatvin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the mentor of the leader of the Olawi celestial sect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunting our demigod." Sharon was like a doll, replied with no emotion and no concealment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the first time I think the chair, table and curtains want to kill me... It’s a coincidence...but this is not an arrangement, just Explain that the rose school has a history of more than a thousand years of hidden organizations, there are not many demigods... Estimated and aurora will be similar, the number of saints is about five, angels add 0 to three seals two or three... Of course, this is Because they have been suppressed by the Seven Churches for a long time, the base camp has become a colony. When they are in full bloom, it must be more than that... Klein thought about it and asked again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, do you know a member of the Rose School that makes the whole mountain tremble with one arm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to describe the characteristics of the arm specifically. I found myself completely afraid to look directly at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon listened quietly, his eyes were like alive, and his voice was cold and clear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A saint, an angel, and "the sea king", the aurora will be semi-god, the spiritual group The monster that comes with the death plan... Klein silently laughed at himself, and smiled bitterly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I got into the 'desire mother tree' and suffered an ambush from the rose school Fortunately, at Baiyam, there were people from the storm church and the kingdom military, and I also threw out the items contaminated by the 'real creator' and the things related to the spiritual group. In short, the scene was very chaotic. I took the opportunity to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He responded calmly, only to hide the existence of the messenger and Mr. Azke, as for the "real creator", he believed in Sha Miss Lun has long seen that he is not affected by slang, which can be explained by timely psychological intervention and psychotherapy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Desire Mother Tree’...” Sharon whispered the name, and there was a rare mood swing in the blue eyes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has no "audience" interpretation ability, can not give the specific mood of Miss Sharon, only vaguely feel that she is a bit afraid of a bit abomination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked across from Sherlock Morioti: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very lucky and very mysterious."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein laughs without saying, neither lying nor explaining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon did not ask, instead said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may have encountered Ah, He was the 'God' born 192 years ago, the child who claimed to be the 'Bounded God', and He is also the leader of the Rose School."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; No, the Rose School sent out the leader and a half-god in order to deal with me... I am just a small sequence 5! If it wasn’t for the “Orange” Hilary reminder, I’m afraid I’ve been caught by the Rose School... Klein was afraid for a while, and asked casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the oracle 'the 'Prisoner' route sequence 2 or the name of the sequence 1?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably." Sharon did not answer affirmatively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, not waiting for Klein to respond, she volunteered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Williams Street It was destroyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has tried to reflect on this topic when Miss Sharon raised this topic, and immediately frowned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it? When?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Night of the Night' and 'Mechanical Heart', more than two months Before." Sharon obviously has the right information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s focus is on contemplation for a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe we all overlooked one piece Things, that evil spirit does not necessarily need us to save, it also controls Pound from the Baron!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will there be a problem with this gentleman, What caused the attention of 'value nights' and 'machine heart'? "Klein is not guilty at all that there is a false speculation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon slightly decapitated:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;" Pound died from a baron after a carnival. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is being processed? The last trace of Arista Tutu's blood was cut off? Klein thought: <br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the situation at Williams Street now? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the construction of some high-rise buildings. "Sharon described it without expression. "Someone was initially monitoring in the dark, and then less and less. At the beginning of last month, there was no more. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has been indulging for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ever explored?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon's light swept over his face:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unwritten agreement between us: discover together, explore together? It’s a noble lady, the rose school’s “abstinence system” "I don't know how many times better than the "indulgence"! Klein tempted to ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go now? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Sharon succinctly expressed his attitude.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately told the driver in front to divert to Williams Street at the junction of the West End and Queens.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, he casually said some of the sea's knowledge and experience without secrets. Although Sharon didn't respond very much, but he listened very carefully, it seems quite Interested.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds Klein of the first time she met the bodyguard, who was sitting on the illusory high back chair in the convex window glass, right hand Holding your cheeks and listening carefully to your conversation with Ian is a potential for “audience.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein and Sharon were not close, they could find that there was a big construction site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the area corresponding to the underground ruins, standing under a dense tree, Klein did not have an umbrella but was not drenched. wet Sharon Road: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "we go on from here." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; rain falls through Sharon’s pale gold hair and body were beaten on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Sharon did not ask Sherlock Moriati what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein put his hand into his pocket and easily lifted the spiritual wall and opened the iron cigarette case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His side of the side suddenly appeared a figure, it is wearing a dark red coat wearing the old triangle hat "the blood above" Senol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He replaced me." Klein said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he calmly manipulated his family. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "Blood on the" Seney Orr immediately to hand on the chest, a ceremony in front of Sharon: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good evening, I am honored to work with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon glanced at Klein and Seignor, saying nothing The body quickly sinks and enters the dirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃, Miss Sharon seems to hate Senorol... Klein outlines the smile and makes the body of the "blood above" quickly resent, followed Settle down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He himself relies on the big tree, half closed his eyes, carefully controls the cockroach, there is no one around, the rain is sparse, the street lights are dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vague agreement, Klein found the feeling of "Master of Secrets". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His vision and Seneol’s horizon overlap at this moment, seeing the dark brown soil, the creeping insects and the debris between the stones . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this layer of obstacles, "He" and Sharon came to the area where the original local remains existed, where the dome collapsed, the stone pillars were broken, and the earth was filled. , gravel embellishment, completely without the original look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene made Klein believe that the human figure of the Six Gods must have been completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the position of "self" and Sharon is quite close to the room where the evil spirits are sealed, that is, in subsequent explorations, He doesn't have to worry about the range of activities that exceed the control limit of 100 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the smell of the earth and the smell of decay, Klein’s secret couple, together with Sharon, quickly entered the previously dangerous room, but the masonry Between the soil, only a few piles of white bone covered with decaying clothes have traces of residual crushing. The original dark gold and dark blue rays disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The extraordinary feature was taken away by the 'night of the night' or 'the heart of the machine'..." Senigal’s face twitched, perfectly reflecting the gram Ryan’s mood at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon turned around in a dark solid environment and shook his head gently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" They didn't send people in. There are no traces of living things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, if there is a living in this room for half a year, "resent" should be able to The induction is... and the gods are obviously not seen by the "nights" and "mechanical hearts"... Where are these extraordinary features gone? While Klein brows a little bit, Senegal has a similar reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the evil spirit not completely eliminated? Has it escaped here? Klein thought about it and suddenly he was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed his emotions and let Senniol follow Sharon through the room filled with dirt and gravel and came to the position where the bloody door stood. At this time, only a few pieces of debris prove that the target has existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
