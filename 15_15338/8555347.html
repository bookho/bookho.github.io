			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian pulled the curtains and made the office faint, then sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held the crystal ball in his left hand, the right palm touched the top, stroked back and forth, and the mouth whispered, like a whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, the dots in the crystal ball are getting brighter and brighter, more and more obvious, as if the night sky has cast a reflection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;often used to determine the direction of fate, the stars of life trajectories emerge one after another, forming a three-dimensional astrolabe, and mixed with many suspected symbols Spiritual revelation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian Gray finally stopped moving and looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No lie...The trajectory of the matter is indeed like this... She seems to be able to bring some changes to the Abraham family, optimistic change..." Crystal The light of the ball faded out, and Dorian stood up and had a decision in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At lunchtime, the Four Wings Restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of Firth, there is a slice of deep-fried fish and sprinkled with rosemary fish. Its skin is crispy, the meat is delicious, and there is no fine thorn. It's quite delicious. The only problem is that the chef's aesthetic is very weird. He keeps two bulging fish eyes and relies on the swaying technique to make them look at the top at the same time. It seems to be telling the death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...Falth pushed the fish head down, cut the fishtail, and covered the upward facing eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Dorian Gray moved the knife and fork, and the edge seemed to inadvertently said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Anlisa loves occultism very much. There is some research in this area. Do you see the corresponding books, notes or articles when you finally clean up her belongings?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some notes and books." Fols calmly replied, "I became a occult lover, but unfortunately, some content I don't understand at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the "Spirit of the World" is not only absurd, but also logically confusing, and it is unsatisfactory. Even if you can force yourself to read it, and regularly heal the anxiety. It is also difficult to remember the contents inside. If you look at it, you will forget it, let alone understand it... Fols added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian’s slightly dagger, haha ​​laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you can ask me, I am also a occult lover, relatively versatile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really? That's great!" Foers teamed up Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that she is really interested, Dorian is about to lead the topic to mystery, sometimes to the spiritual world, and sometimes to the experience of his own meditation - ready When he entered the restaurant, he deliberately chose a remote and quiet location, and the contents of the two people were not heard by the surrounding customers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the lunch, Dorian offered to propose:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never knew how to express it My gratitude, now I don't have to worry about this problem anymore, huh, huh, although Lawrence has paid you, but I don't think it is enough to match your kindness, kindness and trustworthiness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Ms. Wall, you can write a letter to ask me if you have any questions in the field of mystery. This is my insignificant gratitude. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly what I hope to get." "Firth did not refuse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the previous exchange, she can clearly see that Dorian Gray has a succinct knowledge of solid and rich system, not worthy It is a member of the ancient Abraham family.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the shortcoming of Fols, although she has mastered many common senses of the world, but that It comes from a few books and notes that are not in-depth, as well as the scattered discourses that are heard in various encounters at various gatherings. They are not comprehensive, fragmented, and flawed.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the other person’s answer, Dorian raised the cup and smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that one day, we can have mystery Extraordinary ability. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland North, St. Seychelles Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of men wearing black trench coats and red gloves entered the underground area. The first one was a man in his forties. The facial features were soft and his hair was long. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears a flamboyant standard hat and carries a gold-plated black straight stick, quietly following the value of the night lead, and enters a quite Spacious room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are bookshelves in the room, with many files, one with black robes, blue eyeshadows and blush, and a fascinating beauty. The woman sat leisurely on the high back chair and did not get up and greeted. It was the former "Psychic" Dai Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soest, the information you need is there." Dai Li pointed her finger at the table by the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man known as Soest smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dally, How can you be sent to guard this place? You should be responsible for more important things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, this is my own idea, I need to precipitate, more Look at some information.” Dai Li laughed softly. “This is to move forward better. Human beings are a fragile creature. They need a certain period of gentleness. No one can always be at the top of the mountain. Enjoy the excitement and pleasure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Your style has never changed, but unfortunately, you never give me a chance." Soestton Laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily shook her head seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Obviously, you don't know me, I am now The hobby is even more singular. If you can make yourself a rotten corpse or reveal the white bones, I will definitely be interested in you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;She turned to look at a "red glove" standing behind Soest: "Leonard, how did you choose to join his team? This guy is arrogant, arrogant and courageous, always fantasizing him. The lady who likes will lie on the bed and wait for him. Frankly speaking, maybe this is the 'nightmare', characteristic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to nightmares, Dai Li Obviously paused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard reluctantly responded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Dai Li, this is Sesima Your arrangement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way... I can see that you agree with my opinion on Soest." Dai Li’s voice gave me a hoarse voice. A conclusion came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Leonard didn’t know what to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, "Soul of the Soul" Soest did not care about Dai Li’s statement, taking care of himself to the table full of materials, picking up a copy Looking at the file, Leonard and others immediately surrounded the past and imitated their deacon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long-running paper flip, Soest casually asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recent Baker What's new in Rand? You think it's worth paying attention to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delly's eyelids fretting and thought:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Several people who have worked with us have sent a message saying that many people are looking for an organization that believes in 'fool' and gave the corresponding title..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After describing the name of "The Fool" in Lun, she chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I seem to have seen the birth of a new cult, of course, which is the embodiment of an old friend.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soest, what do you think? ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soest seriously thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I have never heard of it." A similar organization. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Leonard raised his head from the file, sinking and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Will this be related to the two Tarot rituals we traced?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘The Fool’ is the first and most important card of the Tarot! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delly for a second, thoughtfully nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You The idea is very interesting..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there is no evidence, it is pure speculation, and even reasoning is not. Soest is not very convinced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard reveals a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Russell the Great said, bold assumptions, careful verification. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillston District, Craig Club.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the Harvest Church, Klein, who had headed straight to the area, just entered the hall and saw the equestrian teacher Tallim Dumont sitting in a secluded place, wondering what to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing lunch and waiting for a while, Klein leaned over and smiled and said hello:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Good afternoon, Tallim, do you seem to have another problem?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talim suddenly woke up and shook his head quickly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you seem to be doing wrong? Klein sighed and sat down and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately Allen and Mike are not there, otherwise we can have a nice afternoon again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talim followed with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are very busy, very little idle . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Klein spoke, he looked around:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock, there is a bit After listening to my story, the big man is very interested in you. I want to see you. Are you willing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frankly speaking, this is really envious of me, this is a very rare opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp And so, what can I do? Helping Mrs. Mary to rape? With Mike reporter to the brothel? Even if I went to the Eastern District several times, I didn’t do anything that was ugly... You know at least that I have contributed in the serial killing case, and I helped Dr. Allen solve the nightmare problem by providing consultation... Ryan heard a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two seconds, he suddenly understood the reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s definitely the big man who asked Tallim what good detective he knew. He could only think of me, so he took the initiative to help me add some sounds. It is a very powerful description, such as the serial murder case, the real suspect who is behind the scenes, the case of Mrs. Mary’s ex-husband and the mistress’s transfer of the property of Coim’s company, the strong sense of action, the sharp sense of smell, the precise detective of the shot... this is Business is blowing each other... Klein secretly sighs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He considered the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talim, sorry, as a detective I have my own principle, that is, try not to mix things involving big people. It may be just a small sneeze-like friction on the upper stage, which is likely to bring me an unbearable disaster.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't tag myself, so I won't go see the big man. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually a precaution for Klein to do before the detective.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once with When the upper class has been involved, it is easy to be taken into account. Before becoming a “faceless person”, he does not want to bear such risks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”... You are very sensible. Talim said indulgingly. "The big man expected this reaction. He thought that such a detective is more trustworthy, so he hopes that you will accept a commission and will not involve the commission of the upper class." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
