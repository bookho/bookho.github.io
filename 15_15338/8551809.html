			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blowing from the bottom has a chilly coolness, and Klein’s spirit is tight and there is a sense of decomposition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s finally here...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as this level is over, at least half a year, I’m Don't worry about similar things...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the promotion sequence 8 becomes the so-called "clown", I can have real combat ability, plus divination. Auxiliary, the guarantee of "Yangyan Charm", even if it encounters a greater danger, there is no small hope to survive...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to wait for the examination of the church, I didn’t even take out the £300 of the “Justice” account in the unregistered account, so as not to be “audited” for economic problems, and was convicted of huge sources of unknown property...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Klein’s ideas were uncontrollably flashing, Dunn Smith took down his shirt collar and said with a low voice:<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Responsible for this test is one of the nine senior deacons of the night, Cresse Sesimma, the church is very important to you."<br / ><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Senior Deacon?" Klein suddenly blurted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirteen Archbishops and nine senior deacons are the upper levels of the church in the usual sense, and it is said that there are many high-ranking strongmen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twenty-two gentlemen and women are completely equal in status. They only follow the goddess of the night goddess and are only responsible to the pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun took a breath of cold air and gently slammed it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes , a senior deacon, but you don't have to be nervous, Crestel only has sequence 5, has not yet stepped into the level of 'half-god and half-human', not too scared and afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, his title in the entire extraordinary world is 'Sword of the Goddess', because it is recognized by a sacred object, the combat power will not be worse than the newly promoted sequence 4."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already talked to him just now, his attitude is very kind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain’s subtext is that he I only said what I said, I didn’t say what I shouldn’t say, let me not be nervous, according to the scheduled plan... Klein nodded thoughtfully and asked: “Where should I go to see this senior deacon?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Alchemy room for dispensing syrup." Dunn replied simply and directly, his face flashed a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alchemy room for dispensing potions? Is that Lab where the old Neil is deploying the "Divination" potion? Klein slowly vomited and returned to the night entertainment room to remove his coat from the coat rack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put on the black thin windbreaker, put his hands in his pockets, step down the stairs down the stairs, and turn left at the crossroads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Klein saw a dark door illuminated by an elegant gas lamp, and saw a long table inside was removed, empty Out of the central part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two classical high back chairs, which stand opposite each other, less than one meter apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one facing the door is sitting in a thirties old man in a black trench coat and white shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His golden brown hair is shaved very short, dark green eyes like a lake in the middle of the night, the neckline of the shirt and windbreaker is high and vertical, the whole The chin is hidden in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Lord Sesima." Klein bent over and bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creste. Seyema's right leg rests on the left leg, rests leisurely behind the back of the chair, and smiles slightly:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Klein, you can sit there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the opposite high chair . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his feet, there is a suitcase made of silver-white metal, which is similar in size and width to the violin case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can hold a sword that is not too long... Kline stepped forward and sat down in his own position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crested bends his right index finger against his nostrils and sinks for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I plan to test your mastery of the potion first, no problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Klein shook his head confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very confident." Crestel laughed, and then kept the attitude, just watching the opposite side quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein suddenly felt the gas light around it disappeared and was swallowed up by the rich darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He became very tired at the moment, just like the sleep time marked by the physiological clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, his spirit is highly tense, difficult to relax, and the same as the usual experience of being too tired to fall asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quiet "night" was pervading around, and Klein heard the ticking of the tap that was not tightened, and heard the voice of the black thorn security company, heard The wind blew through the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, he didn't see anything that shouldn't be seen, didn't hear anything that shouldn't be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good." Crestel's magnetic voice dispelled the darkness, allowing the gas lights inside and outside the alchemy to reappear in Klein's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein Horan was relieved from the intense exhaustion and restored the spirit of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly affected me... Is this the level of Sequence 5? Is this the horror of the senior deacon? He was a little scared to recall the things just happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creste. Sesima put his hands on his lap and the whole person shrank a little and made his lips high. The neckline blocks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You passed the test and your mastery of the potion has reached an excellent level."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next, I want to observe whether there is a hidden danger in your body and mind, whether the spirit of the remnant of the potion has changed the character unconsciously, leaving a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have three minutes to adjust your status."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately said:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He secretly took a breath and let himself slowly enter the state of meditation, removing all kinds of bad idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cresthe did not speak again, pulled out a silver pocket watch from the inside of the black trench coat and slammed it open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he focused on the second hand and walked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three minutes later, Crestel slammed his pocket watch and said with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I started to sing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing? Klein showed a puzzled expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before waiting for him to speak, Crestel picked up a melodious melody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This melody echoed in the alchemy room, gradually losing coordination and no longer conforming to the tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吱! Yeah! thorn! Klein seemed to hear the sound of nails across the blackboard, heard the sound of the plastic foam rubbing, heard the sound of the electric drill, and heard all kinds of noise that made him crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This noise is getting more and more confusing, which makes his heart grow out of want to vent the violent desire to destroy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Klein, who often accepts crazy slang and terrible screams, quickly suppressed all kinds of impulses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also showed a little anxiety, a little tension, a little trouble and a little restlessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too perfect state is the problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when, Crestel Sesimma stopped singing, the noise in the alchemy room disappeared, and the tranquility and silence of the underground came in again. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quiet! Klein lamented from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, very good, there is no hidden danger in your body and mind. Of course, if you want to beat me and want to plug my mouth, it belongs to Normal reaction.” Crestel’s lips were blocked by the tall, standing collar, and people could only judge his emotions from his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't dare." Klein admitted honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cresthe laughed a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, passed all the tests The next question and answer session."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His dark green eyes suddenly become deeper, his eyes seem to be able to see through the body and see the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You ask." Klein straightened his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cresthey kept the same posture, asking like:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You said that the experience of the divination club allowed you to master the potion quickly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Klein answered very calmly but did not do it. More descriptions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creiter nodded slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said this is from the voyeur 'Inspirations from the case of Maxim and Dai Li?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Klein made a positive first, then turned around and explained in detail, "I I know from a 'sister' teammate that the probability of getting out of control is far below normal when I follow the motto of the sneak peek. After that, I heard a sentence that Ms. Dai Li once said, she said she To be a real 'psychic', and she is the genius of the promotion sequence 7 in two years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In combination with these two aspects, I think I can try Let's do a real 'divination' and sum up the 'divination code'. Well, the effect of the experiment is much better than I expected. I quickly mastered the potion, Lord Sesima, I don't know. Do you have a similar experience, when you really master the potion, there will be a special, wonderful feeling..." Klein describes his experience, The ambiguity is not clear enough to explain the "playing the law." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rest of your life, in the face of such a powerful value night, you will be nervous and blush, but you will cross the world. He has sown too many lies, has long been used to similar things, and played without flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep disappearance of the green eyelids of Crestel, the gaze restored its original appearance, a chuckle:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, this is not an illusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From his answer, Klein did not notice the suspicion and scrutiny, and his heart quietly Relaxed a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dun confirmed your experience, I think you are indeed a genius with clear logic and intuition." Crestel praised it and turned to Asked, "Do you share these experiences with your teammates?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." Klein admitted admitly, "I hope to help them reduce their loss of control." The probability, we are teammates, is to face the dangerous companions together, I can't think of any reason to conceal, and for this reason, I did not tell the civilian staff."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crestel put down his right leg and sat up straight, letting the thinner lips emerge from the shadow of the vertical neckline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He curled up his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although you join the night team, there are less than two Month, but I think your understanding of your companions is better than many people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I plan to share some experiences with you, but according to the church It is stipulated that you must swear to the goddess that you cannot tell the people who do not know these things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
