			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Audrey give a positive answer, Mrs. Norma suddenly laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s an honest child.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I just know some quaint experts with great knowledge. Are you interested in talking to them?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, this is my wish, praise the beautiful god." Audrey made a surprise in the chest to draw a blushing month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Norma smiled and sighed with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem." Audrey's excited dawn was a bit innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she said goodbye to Mrs. Norma, when she went to the living room, her smile gradually precipitated, and her temperament was quiet and leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her body language, her emotional color, her mental body mapping to the details of the outside changes, she said that she is not malicious, but quite nervous... It seems Mrs. Norma is probably a member of the psychological alchemy club... Well, she has been observing my expressions and movements just now, but she can't adjust and disguise her emotions. Perhaps she and Su Shi are also "audiences", but unfortunately The reason is that she doesn't know that she is a "reader" in front of her... Audrey is half-heartedly thinking about it, can't help but let her feet alternate forward, gracefully stepping on the straight line.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger Stanton is located in the house in the Hillston area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s lips moved a few times and eventually did not ask Stuart what the employer was and what it looked like.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided not to blend into Emlin White.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although listening to the self, it’s a law-abiding Vampire, but this is limited to what the other person described, and there are too many blanks in his first half of life. Klein can't confirm whether he really harmed the innocent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In this way, he lacks the motivation to find Father Uttravsky to save the other, but he is quite good at fighting, and the magical goods are assisted, and the impaired "Dawn Knight"!<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is also easy to reveal his real identity in front of Father Uttraski and Emlin White.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I hope that he can get the approval of the very capable priest as soon as possible, and that "the sentence" is full of "prison"... Klein silently clicked on the clock for Emlin White.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the bounty, the detectives have to say goodbye, and Klein got the highest treatment sent by the Essinger Detective to the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger took a pipe and coughed twice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still some doubt in the serial killing case. Find out, maybe in the back of the murderer, but also hides a more sinister guy, you recently be careful not to trumpet their played an important role in this case was inside. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the official extraordinary people also suspect that the demon giant dog has a master... Klein solemnly responded:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, I also have speculation in this regard. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Stanton, you must also be careful, you are the convener of the party and the main partner of the police. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger stuffed the pipe into the entrance and took it out again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Summer Locke, I will call you Sherlock, you can rest assured that although I am no longer young, I am still an excellent fighter, a good sharpshooter, with instinctive vigilance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your big probability is that the bit sequence is not low, that is, you don't know which way it belongs... Klein thought about it:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Stanton, you don't seem to be a Beckland native? Your accent is closer to the county of West Vilas. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, just like your East Coast accent." Essinger admitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two detectives immediately smiled and recognized the ability of the other party to observe things in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the evening, Klein returned to 15 Minsk Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I now have 1224 pounds of banknotes plus 5 gold coins, and a small amount of change, which is already quite generous compared to the time when I came to Beckland. However, the extraordinary material of Sequence 6 is at least 1,500 pounds. Sometimes, because of scarcity, because it rarely appears, or even doubles, and the extraordinary person who can get similar items, the sequence is not too low, it is impossible to misjudge Value, low price, there is no possibility of leakage...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the lady behind the "artisan" has the magic of the "black emperor" approach The drug formula is extremely craving, but it has to take into account the progress of her ascension. When she is only in sequence 9, it is almost impossible to spend a lot of money to pre-purchase the formula of sequence 6, unless there is a mine at home, or open a bank... well, I can't always catch a sheep's hair...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thoughts, Klein is not in a hurry to prepare dinner, return to the bedroom, draw the curtains, enter Above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just had an idea and needs to verify it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the position of the fool, he reached out and picked up the "master key" of the quaint, brass color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the notes of the descendants of Abraham who were obtained last night, he guessed that the other party was out of control because he was promoted when he chose the full moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the "master key" makes people cursed to the bad places, the curse-like ability, in addition to the legacy, hidden resentment and unwillingness, and There is no small probability that it is contaminated by the illusory proverb of Mr. Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, what will happen to the full moon?" Klein groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a paper-and-paper pen and writes down the divination statement that has been brewed for a long time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It's performance at the full moon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding the paper in one hand and holding the "master key" in one hand, Klein leaned back against the back of the chair, self-deprecating A smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s going to die again..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, this time should There is not much danger, Mr. 'Men' is far from the real world, lost in the depths of the dark, and I still have fog blocking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case There is no difference between the degree of divination and the direct divination. The experienced Klein half-closed his eyes, and the blind man continued to mourn: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Performance at the full moon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seven passes, Klein fell into a dream . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray, detached, illusory world, he once again saw the basement where the descendants of Abraham died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh and blood here has dried up, the silver pocket watch with diamonds and the ancient "master key" have not been stolen, still lying on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a fiercely empty illusion echoed in Klein’s ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like a fine needle, inserted into his head, extended a little bit, and poked a little bit, seemingly to peel the entire scalp completely Come down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This extreme pain made Klein wake up and sit up straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the blue veins on his back of his hand bulging out and quickly calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, more than a peek into the 'eternal glory', eavesdropping on the 'real creator''s roar is much easier..." Klein changed to knock, leisurely thought Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the change is in the outside world, he believes that he will never have such a reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Miss 'Magician' has always heard this kind of help, she has lost control... It seems that the 'master key' has a curse relationship, making the voice clearer, not right, Uttraf Father Skiath should be the bloody night with the 'master key', and he is obviously unaffected..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, he The 'Universal Key' is placed in the bedroom, and I regret it in the outside hall. Well, only when I have access to the master key, can I hear the 'Helping Sound' at the full moon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Call, before I became a high sequence, I didn't dare to listen in the real world... It just seemed to be the word 'Request for help' in the ancient Hermes language..." Klein seriously recalled it several times and confirmed his hearing. Results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, he can only twitch his mouth, I don’t know if I should cry, or I should laugh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the true sense of life-seeking help!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, if you can let the rose school group hear the door of Mr. Men’s help on the full moon night The character has become cold and distorted, and there must be a burst of one"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about whether there is a way to indirectly achieve this purpose, Ryan returns to the real world, according to the scheduled plan, enjoy dinner, change clothes and go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He transferred twice and went outside the "Brave" bar, just went in and made a turn, and left without any wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, he found that Casper was back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a street was left, Klein specialized in a rental carriage and allowed the other party to drive to Jowood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse just stepped forward, and there was an illusory figure in front of him, just Miss Sharon wearing a black court dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you ready?" Sharon asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cap of the soft cap on her head is firmly pressed against the pale gold hair, and with a pale face, delicate facial features, a kind of doll The beauty of the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein replied calmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am still waiting for an item."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon’s blue eyes are not seen:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have prepared magical items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So will I take three days and a thousand pounds of bodyguards? At that time, I saw the items, but the money was not enough. Klein smiled awkwardly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t worry, the more prepared we are, the bigger we will be."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the magical items in the sun, I can usually use, just to make up for my short board... Klein added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Sharon no longer speak, he took the initiative to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came over today, I want to Let you cooperate to do an experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Sharon asked succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein uses a serious and trustworthy expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" According to Maric’s description, I think that your curse is different. At the full moon, he is so painful that he can't fight because he has to endure the crazy killing and bloodthirsty desires, and you can not get into the human soul, and you will enter the weak. State, is this the case?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon listened quietly and nodded lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have no way for your question, but for Maric, I think there is still a temporary suppression, for example, taking the corresponding pharmacy. Let him be in a state of no emotional ups and downs, so that during that time, he will not be painful and can fully join the battle." Klein elaborated on his own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
