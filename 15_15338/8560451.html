			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at me? This means that Mr. Essinger Stanton often mentions my friend, or is the church of knowledge and wisdom knowing that I was involved in the Bakerland smog incident? Klein smiled and nodded quietly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am Sherlock. Moriarty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man with gray eyes immediately gave way, smiled and slyly gestured:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Stanton Always worried about you, afraid of what happened to you, he can now rest assured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein handed the umbrella to the other side, taking off the hat and taking off the jacket Entering the foyer, at this time, Essinger Stanton, who had noticed, had put down his newspaper and pipe, left the easy chair, and walked a few steps forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, Sherlock, you are finally back, it’s been a long time no see, my friend." Essinger, who was skinny and white, smiled and greeted Come over and open your arms and try to give a greeting hug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not used to this kind of male etiquette, barely responded, and said with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Mr. Stanton, this is not something that wise believers should do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor and bishop of "the god of knowledge and wisdom" always have Since the heart is proud, it is rare to use a hug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in addition to the rough Fossack Empire, the open Kingdom of Intis, other countries and regions are rare such etiquette, only very familiar friends Will appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger stepped back two steps and chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Sherlock, right Really wise friends, we are always worthy of respect and kindness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In my heart, you are the big detective who can be ranked in the top five by Beckland. . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to listen to this! Klein gave a sneer, and humor asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So Are you the top three detectives? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is truly wise to be praised by a believer in the "God of Knowledge and Wisdom" of Sequence 7 and is really happy.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope this is the case in your mind. Essinger responded ingeniously and softly, then asked Klein to enter the living room and sit on the sofa.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His own lying on the easy chair Take a pipe, take a deep breath, and slowly spit out: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very happy that you have not encountered any accidents, your physical and mental state are very good. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you having fun at Desi Bay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein early Prepare for the rhetoric, calmly laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I did not go to Desi Bay, after I circled there, I went to Constance. Ah, huh, I was involved in some troubles in Beckland before I could only find a place to avoid some time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherlock. Moriarty is A gentleman from Kamihain, who has a less obvious accent, is in trouble and is returning to his hometown. It is a normal choice - Conston City is the capital of Kamihain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Essinger responded slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t ask what Sherlock had caused, and he smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, you are welcome to return to Beckland. If you have any help, you can come to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not polite, immediately said: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came to visit you this time, one is really long time no see, the second is that you can sell the shares of Beckland Bike Company on my behalf, huh, huh, all The documents are complete and no other procedures are required."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to play a mysterious rich man and repay the 10,000 gold coins owed to the messenger, he not only intends to clean up the items he does not use very well, but also prepares to give up the 10% stake in the Beckland bicycle company, anyway, Sherlock Mo. For a long time, Riati couldn’t have a bright future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really want to sell?" Essinger fumbled for the pipe. "Although I have never been a businessman, I can see that a bicycle is a kind of A commodity that is very valuable for mass promotion, its commercial prospects are like the rising sun, far from reaching its own extreme. If you sell it now, you will lose a lot of money."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, buyers are definitely willing to pay a lot more for this kind of expectation." Klein chuckled. "I believe that there are not a few people who can see the value and prospects of the bike, and Franmi and Ray. Padd is definitely not willing to reduce any shares at this stage. It is not a problem that my 10% sells normally two or three times. Eisinger, the pricing of equity transactions depends not only on the present, but also on the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very necessary to tell a buyer or investor a fascinating story and to paint a beautiful future! Of course, the value and prospects of the bicycle don't need to be described extra. I can see it from a business-minded person. The only problem is the production of natural rubber... Klein silently added two sentences in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pricing of equity trading not only depends on the present, but also depends on the future..." Essinger whispered Klein's words in a low voice. Praise, "Sherlock, maybe you should go to business, but there will always be many accidents in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dare to take risks is the knighthood of the business world, Ok, I admit, I’m in desperate need of a lot of cash recently,” Kline responded with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger took the pipe and sat down with satisfaction:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You convinced I.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will ask a dedicated lawyer and accountant to determine the current value of the Beckland Bike Company, and then add enough expectations to put your 10% stake Upon sale, the corresponding fees and taxes are deducted from the cash received. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... how can I contact you? Your lease on the house in Minsk Street seems to have expired long ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein certainly does not reveal his current identity and is prepared to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can be in Tasok The newspaper "Beckland Daily" and other newspapers separately published the news of the transfer of shares, so that more people know that there is competition for better bargaining space, and when it is sold, an announcement is also published, indicating that the matter is completed, no longer need to Excuse me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I see this announcement, I will come directly to visit you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger is no stranger to the way of using newspaper advertisements to communicate with each other, nodding his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, of course, all expenses will be deducted from the final harvest. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the main purpose has been reached, Klein stood up and explored the hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Your help, Essinger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should leave, some things will be said later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger did not retain, All the way to send him out the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wraps around the neighborhood, takes a rental carriage, and enjoys the night view of Beckland in the sparse rain, while heading to the "Brave Bar." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He plans to reopen the news and resource channels owned by Sherlock Moriatti tonight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the noisy bar, he didn’t go to the bar to ask for a drink, just circled around the boxing ring and was ready to leave and go outside. Waiting for Miss Sharon to appear on the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the door of the billiard room slammed open, and Ian, wearing an old coat, walked out with a newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His bright red eyes swept away, suddenly aiming at the familiar figure, his mouth opened, but did not spit out the other’s name, just a surprise: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, sir, what do you need to help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not needed for the time being, just come and meet old friends." Klein and sneer laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, he saw Ian’s newspaper as “Sea News”, and the content that was exposed outside had a very eye-catching title:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shocked! Crazy adventurer turned out to be wanted!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crazy Adventurer...Kline Intuition I think this is related to myself. <br /><br />############## "Sea News" is rarely reported in time, because there are rewards in various places.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The crazy adventurer, Greman Spalo, planned a battle The incident that jeopardized the 'generous capital' was confirmed to be a member of the evil organization. In this incident, it depends on the protection of the storm church and the kingdom's military. Baiyam has no casualties, but the 'blood on the subject' is missing. Senigal is therefore missing. Initial doubts have been made by German Sparrow killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you guessing what the prize money they gave for German Sparrow?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "50,000 pounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is more than 'blood above', close to hell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50,000 pounds... Klein was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He healed his heart and smiled and responded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, such a bounty Few people can get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the bar doorway:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I have time to come back to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Ian didn't ask much, but instead said, "Mr. White of Harvest Church is your friend." ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin this guy is coming to the door? For the believers of the original moon? Klein nodded his head: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he squeezed The crowd, the door left the "Brave Bar". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a rental carriage, Klein turned his eyes to the window, waiting for Miss Sharon to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he can’t guarantee that the other person is still here. After several months, the lady and Maric may have changed places where they often live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent, Klein’s inspiration was touched, looking sideways at the window, and I saw it on the glass that was reflected in the night to reflect the scene. The figure of the young girl in a black compact hood wearing a gothic court dress is clearly reflected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, Klein saw Miss Sharon sitting opposite her, pale gold hair, blue eyes, pale face no different from the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening." Klein, who didn't need to play German Sparo, greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon got up slightly, and put on a skirt, and gave a gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that the other party may have seen the "Sea News", he couldn’t find a topic, he cleared his throat and said:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I killed Senigal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Sharon nodded very little. Signal yourself to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein continued with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Maric still needs a 'reprimand 'The extraordinary characteristics, you can wait and collect the funds, and when I find the replacement, I will sell Senolion to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon did not ask " What is meant by the alternative? Simply respond: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After seeing the news, he is waiting for you to come back."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
