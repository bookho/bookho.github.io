			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik was anxious to ask about the "fallen creator", but after hearing the "downside down" problem, he still replied honestly. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is dead?" "Justice", " "The hanging man" and "the magician" also expressed their own surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no expectation of this turning point. After all, the former captain of the exploration team has been shut down for decades, and there has been no problem. Who can He thought that he would discuss his affairs and he will die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, except for the "fool", only the gloomy and introverted "world" has maintained its original state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik nodded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I returned to Silver City After that, I originally wanted to follow the advice of the 'inverted man', and inquired about more from the former captain of the exploration team. As a result, he suddenly appeared behind me and asked if I was looking for him."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, "Justice" Audrey suddenly took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the "Sun" obviously does not have the ability to tell a good story, but the simple description of the other party still gives her a feeling of watching a horror novel late at night, it seems that she Behind the scene, I have also stood so many people, and I am asking "Are you looking for me?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Fols is scared and excited, just like when he was listening to his mother’s story, he was afraid to cover his ears. However, it was still surrounded by people who had their own fingers, so that the sound could be transmitted into their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bridge can be written into the novel! As a best-selling author, she has an outstanding professional instinct! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have no seals on the dungeons of the Silver City for the runaways? There is no barrier between them? I remember you said last time that there is a very powerful and magical item at the core."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but I don't know why he came to my room, and it has completely lost control. The head splits from the middle, there is a constant flow of liquid, and there are many cracks in the body. Each crack is a mouth. "The Sun" Dairik casually described the scene at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you survive? How did you escape from him, no, it?" "Magic" Firth is very close to it The feeling of the situation, this is also the issue of "justice" Audrey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger's reaction is quite different from them, whispering thoughtfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not logical to put a person with a runaway precursor in the next door of such a dangerous guy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you are a senior in Silver City The members of the 'six-member council' are consciously touching the guy to see if he can get more useful information from him and observe his corresponding changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, which elder is you saved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick's mouth Just a little bit open, I only felt that the "inverted man" Mr. seemed to have seen it with his own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only as I describe it, he can guess the truth, great! "Sun" Dairik replied admiringly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, as you said, the 'chief' appeared in time, using that magical item to solve it. Out of control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncertain the respect and admiration of the "sun", "downside down" Alger chuckled:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is an obvious thing, as long as the knowledge is sufficient, it can be easily seen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't think... ... "Justice" Audrey said a little suspiciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t see it... "Magic" Folth stunned his hair with shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't think about it... "The world" repeats the sigh of Mr. "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, Alger frowned and asked slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said that it wasn't long before you returned. The captain of the exploration team lost control.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has not lost control in the past few decades, but suddenly after you return Out of control? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as the question, "upside down" looked up at Mr. "fool" and saw that he was calm and leisurely, without any slight abnormality, the mood was stabilized in an instant. Down, the uneasiness that has just emerged is turned into doubts: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amon family is known as the sorcerer, is that person who discovered the Tarot and found this fog The secret above, but was easily solved by Mr. "fool"?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik nodded seriously:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guessed two reasons, one is because I chose the 'sun' route, and you said that the Amon family is a descendant of the ancient sun god, and the other is that he perceives the 'fool' Pulling me to the party, there was some change, and it turned out to be the latter. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it confirmed? "After hanging people," Alger asked without leaving a gap.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it aware that Mr. "The Fool" pulled people to the party? Can someone really detect it? Terrible...not a blasphemy... "Justice" Audrey is surprised and shocked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but look at the bronze long table, the first look, Immediately, he was calmed down by Mr. Fool’s calm attitude.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a small matter, for Mr. Fool’s, this is just a small matter... ...Audrey was delighted and thought of it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was still someone who could find the call of the Tarot Club... sure enough, so many routes, so many sequences, There is always an extraordinary ability to deal with this matter... but for me now, this is a very bad thing... I am still too weak, and I must ascend the sequence as soon as possible... "Magic" Firth was surprised for a moment Fear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik said truthfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp; "When the controller was solved by the chief, I saw the shadow of Amon, it should be him, he looks like this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeking the consent of Mr. Fool, Dairik showed a light curtain depicting the image of Amon:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Classic Robe, the same color apex, crystal monocle, wide forehead, thin face, black eyes, black curly hair...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Have you seen him? "The Sun" Dairik asked with a expectation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Upside down", "justice", "magician" and "world" shake at the same time Shake his head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric no longer tangled up and continued:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amon The shadow was also wiped out by the 'chief' with magical items, leaving a translucent bug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The chief told me that it was just a avatar of Amon...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He put before I explained the reason why I lived next door. After confirming that I have no problem, let me go home by myself. I am a little scared. I don’t know what Amen’s follow-up measures will be, so when I get home, I start to The Fool's Mr. pray..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Await. "Upside down," Alger frowned and interrupted the words of "the sun." "You said that you have just experienced such a strange and terrible thing, and you are put home by the 'chief'? And when you just returned home and didn't do anything else, began praying to Mr. ‘fool’? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "The Sun" Dairik slightly replied with a sigh of relief.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this have any problems? He feels that the attitude of Mr. "upside down" is rather strange. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey vaguely felt that the "sun" was not handled correctly, but did not figure out where it was wrong in a short time, just believe in changing itself, sure Not doing this, and at this moment, "Magic" Firth has caught her own face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
