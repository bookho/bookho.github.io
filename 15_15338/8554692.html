			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you looking for me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is just in the ear, Dyrac Stiff, the skin is tight, and the roots are standing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is he behind me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did he appear in my room? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the seal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the magic item? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek’s forehead burst into cold sweat and the subconscious will turn back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his instinct prevented his behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This energy is taught in the "Monster Common Sense" class in Silver City and some weird scenes he experienced after joining the patrol:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When someone is talking behind you, don't rush to turn! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric raised his hands, handed it into a fist, and then, in a high alert, slowly and half-turned his body halfway. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is a deep darkness, so that people can't see anything at all, but in Dairik's two eyes, each has a little gold swell, It turned into two rounds of miniature sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ability of this "lighting man", he saw a black shadow sitting quietly on the edge of his bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shadow is clear and clear, revealing the head that has been opened vertically! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the head, two gray-white brains seem to be squirming like life, and they want to be close together but powerless. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cross-section of the brain, the viscous liquid hangs down into a filament, but shrinks upwards like a locust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each side of the eye is far away, the bridge of the nose is separated from the middle, and the blood is bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half of the left side of the mouth opened, but the half of the right side was tightly closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This terrible monster is naked and has a dark red wound on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless wounds smashed open, revealing a row of white teeth, and they said the same sentence in no particular order: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you looking for me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It paused, the corners of the mouth and the edges of the wound Upturned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, I am not normal..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darry Ke's pupil contracted, and he would put it on his chest without thinking about it. The hands that were handed over into a fist were lifted up and placed in the lower jaw, as if they were praying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small room became brighter, and the pure light beam entwined with the flame fell from the roof and hit the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This beam is not as good as Dairik’s use outside the round tower, because the seal here, the magical items here are isolated inside and outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Deric suddenly saw that the divine beam that he prayed for suddenly became thicker, so that he could not help but want to close his eyes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vagueness, in the light column of the Emperor, there are more pure and thick things separated, like a light man without five senses without clothing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "light man" flashed and threw himself on the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the "mouths" of the monsters suddenly opened, as if they were making a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Dairik did not hear anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster trembled fiercely and quickly fell apart in the burning and shining of the "light man" and melted away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was almost transparent, there was a strange shadow appearing in it, wearing a black classical robe and a virtual hood with a pointed bonnet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This phantom black eyes, black eyes, wide forehead, thin face, wearing a crystal carved monolithic eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just emerged, "light man" blasted steeply, and Dairik’s eyes were white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he resumed his sight, he found that he did not know when he was outside the room, and was placed in a corridor inlaid with metal lanterns. Shine in the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked sideways, looking into the room, saw a tall, strong, wearing dark trousers, wearing a brown jacket back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the back, Deric’s original bed, a little bit of morning light condensed into a white leg bone, making it a Put a sharp white sharp sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the Straight Sword, there is a translucent bug lying quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has only a long thumb, a slender near-child's little finger, and a ring of completely transparent color that divides it into many sections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick glanced at each other, did not go to the number of rings, only vaguely felt about ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backed on his tall figure, the detective picked up the translucent strange bug and turned around while sighing:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Dairik finally saw the front of the tall figure: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hair is white, neglected, and looks quite messy. His decree is quite heavy, his forehead has no wrinkles, and some or deep or distorted remains on his cheeks. Old scars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was wearing a linen shirt and a belt that was divided into a number of compartments. His pale blue eyes were deep and vicissitudes. The whole portrait was a This book is full of stories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric is a glimpse of the first, and the rest of the life is surprisingly open:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Your!'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in front of Silver City’s “Six People’s Committee” and “Chief”, a powerful “hunter” over 100 years old. "Colin Iliad! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin gently sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We always knew he had problems, but Find out what the purpose of the person named Amon is, what is the difference, deliberately did not directly remove him, but shut him to the bottom of the round tower, sealed in the influence of magical items, and often let some only have the precursor of out of control The extraordinary person lives next door to him and talks to him to see if he can induce some abnormal changes and get what we want to know.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately Yes, until today, he is normal, but it is too normal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that why he suddenly changed and suddenly tried to penetrate the seal? You How do you feel different from others?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was originally deliberately arranged for me to live next to the squad leader next door... Dairik was silently silent A few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe because of my extraordinary path and others Same, sequence 9 'singer', sequence 8 'Prayer'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is, the "sun" approach...if "downside down" said Yes, the Amon family is a descendant of the ancient sun god, then it is normal for me to make him change... Dairik feels that he has grasped a certain truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin’s expression was heard without change, and Deric was looked up and down for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We have monitored him, and the members of the 'six-members' committee are taking turns, but I didn't expect that he would suddenly change, there was no warning, and the action was very decisive and very determined.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you do in the room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dairik is thinking about the relationship between the "sun" approach and the descendants of the ancient Sun God. For a moment, he did not respond to what the "chief" was asking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After understanding, he still has some hair in his head, seriously remembering what he just did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t do anything, just hit the partition wall and try to communicate with him... Before this, before this, I was attending the Tarot party... Tarot get together! Dairik suddenly stopped and felt that things were not as simple as they thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands that the content he wants can’t talk to the “chief”, but he doesn’t know what kind of expression to make, he can only maintain the usual introversion The silence, thinking and saying: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I knocked on the wall and knocked three times.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Before this, the candle in my room was extinguished, it was dark, I have tried to practice some of my extraordinary abilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin quietly looks at wearing Rick’s eyes, after a dozen seconds, said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a pity that Amon’s stay in his soul is not the body, and things happen too suddenly. We didn't get the most wanted results...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you aware of the abnormalities before he changed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Dairik shook his head quite surely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin’s eyes suddenly highlighted two dark green complex symbols and reflected Dairik’s figure between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence for nearly ten seconds, the Silver City "chief" closed his eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Your condition is stable, you don't need treatment, you can go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derrick yelled:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the "hunter" Colin Iliat turned into the room and picked up The pure white sharp sword was turned over and over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quietly took a breath, along the aisle, went to the exit, and met the caretakers who came one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly returning home, closing the door, he carefully observed the surrounding area, sitting on the edge of the bed, mourning: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A fool who is not in this era, you are the mysterious ruler above the fog, you are the king of yellow and black who is in good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just experienced a terrible thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick said the original thing happened before, and Mention two guesses of your own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, he settled a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the tight retreat, he felt a strong exhaustion, so he lay down and quickly went to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a quiet and dimly lit room, lightning flashes everything, sometimes not in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleeping Derrick’s right index finger suddenly flicked and tapped the bed leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, two, three...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ending the Tarot party, due to the greater spiritual consumption, Klein did not go to the divination "Werewolf" extraordinary characteristics and biotoxin bottle, directly returned to the real world and took a nap, in the twenty After a minute, wake up and open the curtains, so that the plump of the mist will bring a certain light to the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the chair in front of the desk, Klein calmed down and thought about what he had to do recently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The most important thing is to continue to summarize the 'Magician Code' and make adjustments based on subtle feedback from the spirit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
