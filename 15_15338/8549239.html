			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All dead is the norm? Glad that I am still alive? Fortunately, I am still alive? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shuddered and hurriedly took two steps, rushing to the door, trying to catch up with several policemen and seeking protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he just touched the handle and the action suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The police officer said things so terrible, why didn't they protect me as an important witness or a key clue?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this too negligent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tentative, or bait?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of thoughts were fought in Kline’s mind, making him suspect that the police were still "staring" at themselves and observing the reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he settled a lot in his heart, no longer panicked and panicked, slowly opening the door, and the voice screamed deliberately at the stairway position: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will protect me, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪,啪,啪,Police No response, the touch rhythm of leather shoes and wooden stairs has not changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know! You will!" Klein shouted again in a pretending and convincing tone, trying to make himself behave like a dangerous normal person. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps gradually weakened and disappeared on the ground floor of the apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein snorted and laughed in the belly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This reaction is too fake "The performance is unqualified!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't chase him down, turned back to the room and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few hours, Klein fully expressed his uneasy feelings, fidgety, anxious, unintentional, and so on. Relaxation requirements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is called the actor's self-cultivation! In his heart, he laughed at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun was slanting, the clouds in the sky "burned" and the apartment tenants came home one after another, and Klein shifted his focus to other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Melissa is almost out of school..." He turned his gaze to the stove, lifted the kettle in one breath, stripped the coal, and took out the revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a pause, without delay, he reached out to the back of the lower plank of the high and low bed, where there were ten wooden strips staggered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sandwiching the left wheel between a wooden strip and a wooden board, Klein straightened his body and waited nervously, fearing that the police suddenly slammed into the door, carrying a gun, rushing Enter the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s a normal steam world, when he did the move, he confirmed that he would not be seen by anyone. However, there is extraordinary power here, self-verified. Extraordinary power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, there was no movement at the door, only two tenants met to go to the "Wild Hearts" bar on Iron Cross Street. Near, and then from near to far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call." Klein breathed a sigh of relief and put a heart back in his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am waiting for Melissa to come back to make the pea stewed lamb! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thought is a flash, the mouth of Klein seems to be full of scent of gravy, and also thinks of how Melissa is doing the pea stewed lamb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She first boiled the water and cut the meat, then added onions, salt, a little pepper and water, etc., and then put the peas and potatoes at a certain time. , for forty or fifty minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really simple enough to be simple... it’s supported by the deliciousness of the meat itself!” Kline couldn’t help but shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no way to do this. There are many kinds of spices in the civilian family. How can there be a variety of cooking techniques, which can only be simple, practical and economical, anyway? As long as the meat is not scorched and not broken, it is good for people who eat twice or even once a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein can't talk about cooking skills. Everyday is mainly for outside food. But after three or four meals a week, Zhou Zhou accumulates, and he still has a passing standard. He feels that he can't live up to the pound lamb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait for Melissa to come back and do it again, after 7:30, it will be hungry for her... It’s time for her to see the real Culinary!” Klein found an excuse for himself, first let the fire re-ignite, went to the common bathroom to pick up the water and cleaned the lamb, then took out the cutting board, kitchen knife, and smashed into small pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for how to explain the sudden cooking, he decided to push to the ghost of Welch McGregor, who not only invited the sea Chefs with special flavors often try their own food and ask for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the dead will not refute me! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, hey, this is a world with extraordinary people, the dead may not be able to talk... so thinking, Klein has a dim sum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He throws away the messy thoughts, puts the meat in the soup bowl, then takes out the spice box and shakes a spoonful of yellowed Coarse salt, in addition, from the special small bottle, take some black pepper, and grab the lamb and salt together, and marinate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place the saucepan on the stove and wait for it to heat up. Klein flips to find the carrots left yesterday, and cuts the onions bought today. It has become a lot of pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was ready, he took out a small jar from the cupboard. After opening it, there was not much lard left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein made a spoonful, put it into the pot, fry it and melt it, then pour the carrot and onion pieces and stir fry for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scent began to pervade, and Klein poured all the lamb into it and carefully fry it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, it’s time to order some wine, and then you have to use wine instead. Moretti’s family doesn’t have these extravagant things. Drinking a beer, Klein had to be simple because of it, pour some boiling water and just play it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stewed for about twenty minutes, he opened the lid, put the tender peas and the chopped potatoes, added a cup of hot water, two spoonfuls of salt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the lid and lower the fire. Klein is satisfied and exhales, waiting for his sister to go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, the fragrance in the room is getting richer and richer, the temptation of meat, the mellowness of potatoes, and the "freshness" of onions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taste gradually mixed, and Klein swallowed his mouth from time to time, and opened the pocket watch and looked at the minute hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than forty minutes, the light but rhythmic footsteps approached, the key was inserted, the handle turned, and the door opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good incense..." The Melissas had not come in, and whispered in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the bag and stepped in, her eyes swept over the stove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you do?" Melissa took off her hat and paused in the air, looking at Klein's gaze full of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took her nose, inhaled more aroma, her eyes quickly softened, and seemed to find some confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you do?" she asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are afraid that I will waste the lamb?" Klein smiled and asked, not waiting to answer, and said to himself: "Reassured, I specifically consulted Vail. What should I do with this dish, you know, he has a good cook."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First time?" Melissa's brow is not consciously wrinkled Up, but it was smoothed by the aroma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I am very talented." Klein laughed. "It’s going to be good. You put the book hat and put it in the bathroom. And then wait for the tasting, I am very confident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to his brother’s orderly arrangement, watching his gentle and calm smile, Melissa is stunned At the door, there was no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you like to simmer a little?" Klein laughed and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
