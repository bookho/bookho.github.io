Finally, Dunn spoke again, his voice low and without emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, but I respect my inner voice "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, the "sleepless" does not meet their own needs, the "audience" in the "Talo Party" is also described, other extraordinary ways do not know When can I get in touch and not be in a hurry, so there is no need to wait. The same reason, the "collector" is followed, leaving only the "Peeping Man" and "Divination" options. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the premise that the sequence of potions is equally dangerous, in the case that it is unable to obtain more information itself, in the "Peeping Man" and "Divination" Before the facts that meet the requirements, then whether or not Russell the Great is not just writing, is it true that one of the "apprentices", "thefters" and "divination" is not enough to make his inner balance happen? tilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as can be seen from his notes, as long as you can understand the true meaning of "digestion" and "play", you can maximize the negative impact of the potion Influence, as for the whispering whisper and illusory temptation that makes people crazy, even if they don’t become extraordinary, they are also exposed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Dunn Smith stood up and took a half-height black top hat and said while wearing it, "Go with me to the bottom." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded and gratefully performed the gentleman's ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, hey, hey, the two went down, and the footsteps were on the silent stairs and the aisles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein Horan has some tension and has nothing to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, you After taking the potion, I don’t get the corresponding occult knowledge directly. I just have the qualification to learn and master them. Where did the original occult knowledge come from? The sages risked their lives and groped a little, still From other?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time he came to the ground, he could feel the air here was quite fresh, obviously the ventilation was very good, just in this environment. Occasionally, blowing a gust of wind is really chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean looked at him sideways, his gray eyes were very quiet in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He replied plainly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One is what you said to explore, summarize, and improve, The second is the gift of the gods, three, oh, the dangerous 'whispers' that others can't hear, not always mad, no meaning, occasionally, occasionally telling about mysterious things, but as far as I know Those who really listen to these and listen for a long time are crazy without exception, or become fallen into monsters. Of course, we have to thank them, and the notes they left are valuable treasures in the field of occultism."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human-shaped mouse?...The ground is cold and cold, and Klein suddenly shudders:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I became The "transfer ceremony" of "friends magic", will it always accompany those crazy and horrible "whispers", will it bring about the same impact? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crossroads, Dunn neither went to the "Chanis Gate" nor transferred to the "Weapons, Materials and Literature Library", but with Klein, chose to approach the Saint Serena Church on the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was halfway through, he paused and didn't know what touched him, opening a secret door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is our 'Alchemy Room' for the Night Squad, I will let the old Neil go to the Chanis Gate to receive the formula of the 'Divination' potion and The corresponding materials, oh, you are lucky, the goddess is blessing you, there should be two copies of the 'Divination' related materials, otherwise it will have to wait for a long time.” Dunn pointed to the room inside the door and said, “You are waiting here. Then watch the whole process of the old Neil's preparation of the potion. This is the most basic thing of occultism. Well, don't mess with the items inside. They are either very dangerous, expensive, or dangerous and expensive."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, Dunn added as before: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I have forgotten something, you become an extraordinary person based on dealing with danger and looking for notes. Need, credit only accounts for a part of it, so you can't turn into a formal team member for the time being, it is still a civilian, it is still its corresponding salary, still do the things I arranged before, just extra to follow the old Neil to learn a lot of mystery Learn the knowledge, arrange your own time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Kline had some resentment for not raising his salary, and the other raised his hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Dunn’s statement, taking the potion, and learning and mastering, directly becoming an official member, participating in tasks related to supernatural events, I really don’t know How to write the word death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun turned his body and walked two steps to the crossroads, and then returned to his body:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There are still things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know... Klein has become accustomed to the captain’s similar "style." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have had some gains from the actions of the Secret Society." Dunn said with a smile, "In a short time, they should not dare to provoke us." However, you should not care about it, because it is temporarily impossible to confirm the importance of the Antignus family notes to them. From our findings, they do retain some ancient customs that can be confirmed with the Solomon Empire. At that time, the fallen aristocracy was related."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, thank you captain." Klein breathed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the reasons why he is unwilling to wait and has the opportunity to become an extraordinary person and can’t wait to catch it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was sent to Deng Enyuan to confirm that he would not return to supplement, Klein walked slowly into the alchemy room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a long table with test tubes, droppers, balances and beakers, like the chemical laboratory he had seen in his life. It's just more rudimentary and more ancient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there are strange signs such as large iron pots, black wooden spoons, crystal clear balls, and dark sacred emblems. They are rendered out of thin air. A little mysterious color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked around with interest, but did not tamper with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the footsteps came, and Neil walked in a small silver box with a complicated pattern. He still wore a dress that did not conform to the times. Classical black robe with a round top felt hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little guy, I didn't expect you to choose 'Divination'." Old Neil put down the silver casket and used a slightly turbid dark red dice. I swept Klein. "It’s just as good as I was in the past. It’s not good. It’s good. You light these gas lamps and close the secret door.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Okay." Klein resisted the tremor, igniting the gas lamp in the alchemy room, and reigniting it with a bleak light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zha, Zha, Zha, the closed door closed, he turned back to the gray hair, the corner of the corner of the corner of the old wrinkles, and saw the other side tied A few strange branches brushed the black iron pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sequence of potions is very simple to prepare, at least the sequence below 7 is like this, no special flames are needed, no extra rituals are needed, no spells are needed , do not need their own spiritual participation, as long as the order of the recipe, the material components are accurately added in turn, and then stir, you can." Old Neil smile wrinkles seem to bloom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Klein asked quite strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sounds as simple as your own "transportation ceremony"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶, think I want to be a little scary...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps this is the gift of the gods, praise the beautiful god." Old Neil moved a circle in the chest with a very irregular attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he opened the silver casket and took out a roll of parchment with an old sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tawny parchment unfolded in an inch, revealing the words above, and Klein looked at it and found himself familiar with Hermes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are written in bloody ink and seem to retain the feeling of hooliganism, but there is no other extraordinary feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Divination': 100ml of pure water + 13 drops of night vanilla juice + 7 pieces of golden mint leaves..." Klein silently recited the contents of the recipe. The follow-up part was just blocked by the old Neil elbow and could not be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pure water is distilled water, just before I have made it, no need to waste time." A large sealed glass bottle with a scale on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the lid and poured about 100 ml of pure water into the large iron pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t dare to ask, afraid of affecting the preparation of the other party, after all, the potion that came out had to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"13 drops of vanilla juice, this can be extracted and made into essential oils." Daniel took a brown vial from the silver box and used the dropper. The action easily dropped 13 drops into the big iron pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A scent of calm and tranquility permeated, and Klein’s mood became unconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"7 pieces of golden mint leaves..." Old Neil picked up the tin can with silver pattern, uncovered the lid, and took a few pieces with bare hands and sprinkled it. In the big iron pot, the fresh and stimulating taste is faintly audible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"4,5,6,7, just right." Old Neil smiled and looked at the potion recipe on the parchment, "3 drops of poison堇 Juice, this thing you can not drink, will be paralyzed, stiff and dead, in ancient times, it is the best choice for suicide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am again Not stupid... Klein groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil changed a dropper and dripped the poisonous simmer into the big iron pot, mixing the strange and whimsical taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"9 grams of dragon's blood grass powder." Old Neil unhurriedly put his hand into the silver casket, lifted a transparent test tube, the powder inside Dark as iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He weighed 9 grams of powder with a beaker and a daily equalizer, poured it into a large iron pan and stirred it with a black wooden spoon. Klein had a liver tremor and always felt unreliable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, the above materials are all auxiliary, adding more points and less points, does not affect the final effect, or do I put it again?" I opened a joke. "There are two kinds of keys that are the key. The weight can be a little less, but you can't deviate too much. Otherwise, your 'promotion' will fail. Well, they can't be much more, even if it's just a little bit. Otherwise, you have to go to treat mental problems after taking it, and you don't have to die directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately tightened his spirit and looked at Lao Ni I took out a black glass bottle from the silver box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lava octopus blood, 10 ml, this octopus is an extraordinary species, with obvious variation, the body is covered with a mysterious symbol, its blood in the sun Under the illumination, it will decompose rapidly and lose its speciality. It must be preserved with opaque materials.” The old Neil tone is no longer easy, and the action is quickly and carefully taken with 10 ml of blood in a test tube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood has a blue sky, and from time to time it pops up an illusory bubble, as if connected to a spiritual world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pour the blood in the test tube, the remaining point on the wall is not in use, this is an over-prevention." Old Neil whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the blue blood entered the iron pot, it was in contact with the previous liquid, and the sound suddenly screamed, and the surrounding light was stained with light blue. Let Klein have a strange feeling that is far away and familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be the experience in the mother, that makes the soul climb as high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last, star crystal, 50 grams." The old Neil's voice was in Klein's ear, let him go back to God and look back. Long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old gentleman’s hand has a piece of crystal that is pure to the extreme, and the crystal is gelatinous, like the jelly on the earth, lacking enough hardness. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shines a little brightly under the light blue light, and the body seems to hide a starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
