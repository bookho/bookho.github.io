			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tingen City, Daffodil Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is discussing the recent popular drama with his brother Benson and his sister Melissa, and sincerely invites them to go to the Grand Theatre next Sunday night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think the newspaper has already said enough, "The Earl Returns" is definitely a drama worth watching, it has been played in Beckland for dozens of games. The venue is full, I think we should not miss this opportunity." The lack of entertainment makes Klein unwilling to give up, after all, he was also a man who had watched the drama in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if it is not to maintain the image, I would rather go to the pub to play billiards... Well, renting a venue to play tennis is also good, this can be considered, belongs to the middle class Class leisure projects, with my current physical fitness, as long as I don’t meet other extraordinary people, I can easily cope with most of my opponents... Forget it, I can only think about it for the time being. I will re-investigate the people related to Lalhous in the morning. Things, fighting in the afternoon, I have to check some red chimney houses before going home in the evening...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am really a busy person... Klein is thinking hard With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Benson has been moving, Melissa is still hesitant, he added with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It is said that the most popular supporting role of "The Earl's Return" is a talented mechanic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, anyway, I have to go to the Coliseum to watch a play." Melissa licked her lower lip and said she was very stubborn, but her eyes were brighter than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was waiting for a response, and his ear whispered, his head stunned for a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is praying to me...He will turn his right hand behind him and chuckle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will wait patiently for the opening of the booking day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will get a report back to the bedroom."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We also have to invest in the ocean of knowledge, hoping not to die in it." Benson laughed at himself and went back to the restaurant with Melissa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein went up to the second floor, locked the door of the bedroom, blocked the entire room with a spiritual wall, then went four steps back and mourned the mantra. Come to the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palace of the giant’s residence, his figure emerged at the top of the bronze long table, and a shrinking and expanding image was seen in the eyelids. Crimson stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein raised his right hand, spread spirituality, and touched the star that symbolized "justice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang, he saw a distorted picture and saw Miss Justice in a beige court dress, sitting in a chair in the dark corner, hands Hold it against the buried forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the slightly immature and tight sweet voice of the unpretentious superintendent, reverberating: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"A fool who does not belong to this era;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the mysterious ruler above the fog;"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the king of yellow and black in good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for your gaze;"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for your hearing;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I met a suspected Zilingers at the ball held by the Duke of Nigan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He disguised as Baron Graham, purpose Unknown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found from some details that today's Baron Gramer is different from the past, which reminds me of the magical items of Qilingus. The extraordinary ability to change looks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;Klein listened carefully, carefully distinguished, and finally figured out what Miss "Justice" described:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qilingus even used the special ability of "squirming hunger" to mix into the dance of the Duke of Nigan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he didn’t expect was that a noble lady was an “audience” and remembered the “audience” of the former characteristics of Baron Gramer, so she didn’t know it. It’s exposed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this guy want to do? And what should I do? I tried the sacrificial rituals without spiritual materials in the past two days and found that I could create something similar to the "Summoning Gate", but I couldn't open it. I was looking for a time to go to the underground trading market to buy some spiritual materials to do the second. The second experiment... Miss "Justice" attended the dance party, and certainly will not carry spiritual materials with him... Klein pondered for more than ten seconds and began to respond to the "justice" prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small prayer room of the Duke of Nigan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey repeatedly prayed several times, finally stopped, sorted out the clothes, and quickly walked to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows she can't go away for too long, otherwise she will worry her father and mother, and misjudge the situation and make an incorrect response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After standing at the door, Audrey took a deep breath and stretched out her right hand with white gauze gloves with a sly and uneasy feeling. Anti-lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the little prayer room, she returned to the "restaurant" along the corridor, seeing the guests who were holding the wine glasses and holding the plates getting closer and closer, she Suddenly a flower in front of me, I found that there was an illusory fog around me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the thick gray mist is an old high-backed chair, sitting on a high-back chair, making people unable to see the mystery of appearance and body. Looking down on the mysterious existence of everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Fool"! Audrey was almost surprised to blurt out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she heard the familiar low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is still echoing, the fog has disappeared, and Audrey’s eyes are still the long table with food and drink, still staggered. The lively scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guilt and uneasiness of the heart disappeared, she subconsciously straightened her back, looking forward to the "restaurant" and walking towards the lounge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, inside the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to Miss Justice, Klein began to think about how to convey this matter to the "downside man." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s definitely not possible to repeat the narrative by myself, there is a dislocation.........the mysterious existence is personally a microphone!" He pondered for tens of seconds. Suddenly, I had an idea to present the picture and sound that Miss Justice had just prayed for, and turned it into a mosaic-like movie scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reach out, Klein put this repeated replay of the light curtain into the deep red star that symbolizes "downside down". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Jowood, Holy Wind Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a simple and simple room, "Down Man" Alger Wilson is studying the investigation report in recent days, trying to find "Hurricane Lieutenant" from inside "The clues of Qi Lingus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is diagonally above his right hand, and a stack of papers filled with distorted "symbols" is placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Alger leaned back and raised his hand and narrowed his eyes, he found that his eyes became illusory and showed a thick gray mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the fog that can't be seen at the end, there is a high back chair that always exists there, and the high back chair sits on the road. People. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool"... When Alger just came up with this idea, he saw the faint gray figure and the vague figure wearing the court dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She keeps her prayers and keeps saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I met a person suspected of Zilingers at the ball held by the Duke of Nigan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He disguised as Baron Graham, whose purpose is unknown." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found from some details that today's Baron Gramer is different from the past, which reminds me of the magical items of Qilingus. Extraordinary ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger was shocked and immediately showed a surprise expression. Press your chest with your hand and lower your head: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Same you, Mr. Fool!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He The voice did not fall, and everything that was heard and seen disappeared and disappeared. It seems that it has never appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the desk with Russell’s diary and investigation report, Alger’s pupils shrank and felt the power of the fool again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Holy Wind Cathedral, the former Storm Church headquarters. Although this is more than a thousand years ago, it does not prevent believers from still regard it as one of the holy places. However, Mr. "Stupid" still silently "falls" and responded...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few silences, Alger took the items and turned to go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to find one of the cardinals of the Storm Church, the Archbishop of the Beckland Parish, "The Singer of God" Ais Snake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Alger Wilson, killing "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qilingus is the best development, but if you can't do it, you can confirm The death of the other party is also acceptable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transfer" the description of Miss Justice to the hangman After that, Klein left the mysterious space above the fog and returned to his bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not in a hurry to dispel the spiritual wall, but sits at the desk, spreads out the paper, picks up the pen, and begins to write:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...According to the urgent information I received, Qilingus changed to the Baron of the Graham with the ability of the 'Shepherd' and mixed into the ball of the Duke of Nigan. It is not clear what his purpose is for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not worried that Mr. Azick suspects himself, doubts have just happened in Beckland, why is he in court? People in the root city can quickly know that there is such a telegraph in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if this will interest you, but I think it's necessary to let you know." Klein quickly ended and folded the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he flipped through the old copper whistle, smacked it, whipped up the gang, and blew it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge, horrible, illusory white bone messenger reappeared and stood still there, not thinking about his head getting into the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein resisted the urge to use the "clown" ability, did not turn the stationery into a flying knife, and honestly threw it to the messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blowing the copper whistle, ending the summoning, Klein converges and turns things over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only do what he has now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Klein can also use the "calling ritual" to carry the "yangyan spell" and personally go to Bakerland, but this is too dangerous, Qilinger Si is the "winder" of Sequence 6, and there is also a magical item of "squirming hunger". Second, it is too troublesome. It must first get the "Yangyan Charm" on the fog, and the third is too easy to destroy. Image, so he rationally gave up this plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, the problem is not big. The Duke of Nigan is the biggest aristocrat outside the royal family. The big man behind the Conservative Party, there are certainly high officials in the people who attend the ball today. Expensive, to say that there is no strong extraordinary protection, I am the first one who does not believe, the second of Zilingus, um, not considering this factor, he does not need to pretend to mix in... Since the 'just justice' has been discovered in advance Let the nobles get ready, things will not become too serious, and they will lose control..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how much speed Mr. Azick's messenger has. Fast, if he can use the spiritual world to shuttle, he still hopes to catch the 'meal'. If it is as slow as Ms. Dai Li's messenger, then she can only watch the news and guess the truth..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
