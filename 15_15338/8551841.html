			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, finally passed... This passed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing Cres Thai Sesimma's announcement, Klein, who had been psychologically prepared, was relieved first, then slightly confused, feeling that this was not true, like a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his prediction, the examination should be more difficult and longer, but if you think about it carefully, you think that the current state is what it should be, if he It is not a month to digest the "Divination" potion, and seek promotion, but wait until after three years, the test may not even alarm the church, only the captain of the night-time team of the Tingen City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that there would be a link between family and interpersonal relationships... Well, perhaps President Sesimar arrived in Tingen two days ago and secretly completed it. This step... I thought that the examination will include the completion of the designated task. Oh, this is really what I want. The purpose of the examination is simply to confirm the extent of my digestive potion and whether there are hidden dangers. "Is there any experience to share with others... One thought flashed in Klein's mind, and he showed his heartfelt smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, stopper Lord Sima."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's beauties!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cresett gently sighs first "Promotion is to better serve the goddess and better protect the good believers. You have to remember this. Believe me, it can also help you resist the temptation of losing control. Remember, it is temptation."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Temptation..." Klein chewed the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cresthe looked at him with a dark green eyelid and said very seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "'playing the law' can help you digest the potion and reduce the risk of losing control, but it is not a panacea, and even at some point, it will make you confused about the role played and the existence of the self, you know, such Opera and drama actors will inevitably have serious psychological problems. To a certain extent, you will be truly mad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, you are just playing... ... This is the only consideration that Silver City has summed up, which is basically consistent with the description of Dessie Dessie... Klein nodded thoughtfully and agreed with the other side's point of view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Additional." Crestel emphasized that "out of control is not only related to the potion, but also closely related to your own emotional state and mental health." Well, the most important thing for the extraordinary is to be able to control themselves. Only in this way can we resist the temptations of the evil spirits and demons, and resist the erosion of greed and other emotions and desires. Of course, I don’t mean to completely exclude similar emotions and desires. This is something that human beings, even half-god and half-human existence, can't do. Well, maybe there are only certain special sequences to achieve that state."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Is it necessary to keep these emotions and desires within a reasonable level, not to be controlled by them, to do something that is irrational and abnormal?" Klein suddenly thought of Neil, could not help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crestar's key points:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the answer, his eyes burst into a few wrinkles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what I want to marry you, then I will put, um, the formula of the 'clown' potion and the corresponding materials for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bent down and put the silver box on the long table Then turned around and moved a few steps to block Klein's view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the surrounding light disappeared again and again, Klein stood in pure darkness and suddenly understood that the formula and materials were in the box containing the holy things, but only Before the gaze was completely attracted by the pure white bone sword, there was no attention or attention to the fact that there were no other items inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, the light of the gas lamp re-illuminated the alchemy room, and Crestel pulled the box away and let the long table be placed Presented in the eyes of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, the most eye-catching is a palm-sized gray horn, which seems to be shrunk from the normal scale, crystal clear, radiant, internal vague There are layers of strange patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the shofar is a blue rose with red lines on its petals, which are linked to each other and seem to have become a grin face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahaha, hey, hahaha, hey... Klein heard the illusory laughter and the cries around, and saw a little gray mans floating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adult Hornachs Grey Goat is a horn, the complete face rose, um, the main material of the "Clown" potion! He couldn't see the dagger, and he walked to the front of the long table in a few steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pure water 80 ml, mandala juice 5 drops, black side sun flower powder 7 grams, gold cape grass powder 10 grams, 3 drops of poisonous juice... ..." Klein looked at the spread of parchment and compared the content written on it with the recipe in his memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirmation, he recalled the original presentation of the old Neil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a breath and slowly spitting out, Klein converges on the emotions and uses the equipment in the alchemy room to distill out the pure water needed for the potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——In the potion formula, pure water refers to repeatedly distilled water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he cleaned the black iron pot and put the auxiliary materials in order. He was as skilled as the high school chemistry experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no catalysis of extraordinary materials, he did not find a significant change in the liquid in the iron pan, at most, it can see the powder impurities suspended in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing the prerequisites, Klein turned his attention to the two main materials, and sincerely thanked him in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter whether the Hornachs Grey Goat is a horn crystal or a face rose, there is no quantitative description... Maybe the adult horns crystal, or the complete face rose, there is no The difference is just in line with the requirements... Well, in a mysterious and extraordinary world, this is something that is absolutely possible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this way, I will Don't worry, you will put more master material!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smooth for a few seconds, Klein picked up the face rose and put it into the iron pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strange flower just touches the liquid and immediately makes a sizzling sound, and the illusory laughter around it becomes more and more sharp:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahaha, hahaha! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not delay, quickly grasped the crystal mysterious horns and threw it into the iron pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squeaky laughter disappeared abruptly, and the little gray spots floating around it quickly shrank into the iron pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked down and saw that the liquid inside was stained with gold, yellow, and red, and they were intertwined but very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, hey, one bubble tumbling up in the liquid, but it can't be pulled out, it can only be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of scene reminds Klein of Sprite in the last life, the bubble drink of the last life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels so good to drink...He has a flash of thought that matches his national identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the tension, excitement and anticipation, Klein used the device to transfer the liquid from the black iron to a glass bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him was that the potion did not remain in the iron pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a potion that can make people extraordinary... Kline raised his right hand and stared at the cup of good-looking golden red liquid in his palm. Crestel Sesima, who is next to the <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, has remained quiet and laughed at this time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Don't worry, at least I didn't see that there was a problem with your process of blending the potions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am waiting here, just to handle your taking Some unexpected situations after the potion, you can rest assured that as long as the problem is not serious, I should be able to save it back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Klein nodded, But put the "clown" potion back on the long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
