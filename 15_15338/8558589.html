			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear the words of German Sparrow, the first reaction of Dakwell is to tell the things of the strange scorpion unreservedly, and to make yourself The adventurer hired at great cost grasps the root of the problem and effectively guarantees his personal safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he immediately thought of the teacher’s embarrassment, thinking that the scorpion is probably a very important seal in the school, once the Greman Spa is accurately told Luo, may induce the greed of the other party, let things develop in a more bad direction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumor that the adventurer kills the task clerk in order to get higher income is not a thousand at sea, it is similar, I don’t know about Gelman. Paro, I don't know how he is, must be cautious and careful! Moreover, the scorpion turned to two points on its own, the situation is not the worst and most desperate, and there is a waiting opportunity... Dakwell hesitated for a few seconds, finally made a decision, intends to avoid the key points, only talk about the surface phenomenon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously avoided the seemingly peaceful gaze of German Sparrow:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the case. My teacher and I belong to a secret organization. The flight is due to internal traitors.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have a path to fate, I can make myself lucky and make my goal unlucky... I, I may have been cursed, so I was just so unlucky to be hit by lightning. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the explanation, he forcibly concealed his inner guilt and waited for a response from German Sparrow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he not believe me? His powerful and experienced adventurer should be hard to deceive... If he finds that I am lying, most of them will take me directly to the sea...Dakwell Standing there, uneasy, like a student called by a teacher to the lecture hall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a life school... “Monster” route... Klein If you think twice, nod your head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You try to be less active, I will consider how to deal with bad luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount... Dirkwell stunned and couldn't believe that Gilman Sparo accepted the reason for his temporary weaving so easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He forcibly squeezed his smile and expressed his gratitude, then returned to his own room, leaning against the door panel and pulling out the ring box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! His palm twitched open the lid and found that the milky white scorpion didn't know when he had turned around, six points up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that I was lucky enough, so I successfully deceived Gelman Spalo? Dakwell thought with a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owl Mr. Harry re-dropped, but did not choose the shoulder of the fat pharmacist, seems to be worried about the things that were previously being shackled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stands on the wooden table, eyes rolling in front of the road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dak Will, you are very nervous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This does not require you to tell me." Dakwell said angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owl exhibited its wings:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then I will change one." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think I have to consider changing the owner." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German Sparo seems to be a good choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... ...that me?" Dirkwell asked, for a moment, forgot to be angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owl Mr. Harry snorted two times:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you notice your inner worries and Fear? You yourself suspect that you may not see the sun of tomorrow, the weird scorpion is really too dangerous!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...How do you know the teacher of my teacher?" Dakwell asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Harry proudly raises his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not doubt the vision of an owl." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkwell has fallen into thinking, not paying attention to its answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, If you can't do that, throwing the donkey into the sea can't solve all the problems.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the old man's previous statement, even if it was buried by the sea, after a few days, it can Let the big guys pick up and pick it up, it’s really lost, silly bird, you don’t have enough occult common sense, don’t understand that these important seals are like the most popular prostitutes in the Red Theatre, always attracting those hungry Thirsty men. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Includes you. "Owl Harry calmly responded. "As for the problem of insufficient occult common sense, I think there is a famous saying that can be explained. Russell has said that if a child does not receive a good education, it is the fault of his father. This sentence can also be used to describe the problem between the pet and the owner. Ok, Dirkwell, no matter what, I think you have to talk to Gilman Sparo about the scorpion, otherwise it will be even more dangerous. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will take a look, look again, maybe it will be fixed at six..." Dirkwell hesitated.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat down on the edge of the bed and lay down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the storm that had been raging for a while gradually subsided and the sky began to clear. The passenger ship blew the whistle that set sail.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first class living room, Klein looked out the window, looking at the rainbow after the rain, the heart is not like The surface is so calm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple enemies, he is not afraid, above the sea, except for the four kings and the official demigod, except for the pirates in the form of fleets Generals, others are hard to threaten him with "squirming hunger" and several magical items. Even if the ship is smashed, even if he falls into the sea, he can find a way to escape if he has many spells in the "Poseidon" field. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But luck is hard to grasp, not within his ability, or even think of it <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although my title is the king of yellow and black who is in good luck, it was changed from that transshipment ceremony, and the role of the transshipment ceremony is obvious. It’s not that people are getting rid of bad luck... Dakwell’s things are a bit difficult to do, they can only work hard, pay close attention to his situation, and once there is a bad thing that will cause death, immediately rescue... I hope to survive these few Days, to the island of Olav, the fat pharmacist's elders should have a way to let him transship... Klein licked the forehead, and there is nothing unusual.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... .........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkwell who was too nervous to sleep well last night was unconsciously caught in a dream.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, his stomach told him that it was time to get up for lunch.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to open his eyes, but it seemed to be pressed An invisible person makes it difficult for him to move.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that his back brain is swelling, a little stinging, and he feels that breathing begins to change. Difficulties, the heart beats more than the normal frequency.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, don’t want to die in the dream... Dirkwell struggles, but how can he wake up? Come, the whole person is getting weaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, his mouth was opened by sharp things, the cold liquid was poured in, and along the lines of the face, the chin was wet and neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell’s body eased, his eyes finally opened, and he saw two bright yellow eyes like gold could touch his head. Together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultivating only extraordinary pets still works... Dirkwell first felt it, then quickly sat up and pulled out the ring box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the voice inside turned to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlucky enough to die in a dream? No, it doesn't feel so simple. It seems to magnify certain probabilities, such as the probability of sudden death in a dream, the probability of being struck by lightning... No, no, and then, I will definitely die! Dakwell thought with horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear quickly defeated him, driving him to take the ring box and rushing to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it was due to the sudden death, he had no strength, holding the handle, it was difficult to screw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Help! Help!" Owl Harry screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was opened and hit the head of Dakwell. If it wasn’t for Klein’s deliberate control of power, the fat pharmacist might have broken his head and blood flowed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t worry about the bruise on his forehead, Dakwell said in a panic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is this scorpion that makes me unlucky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is now 1 point, I will fail to do anything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just already Think about it, telling the whole thing about German Sparrow, expecting this powerful adventurer to give effective advice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the possibility of greedy murder, he did not rule out, just think that in two harmful things, if you want to make a choice, you must choose relatively less of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telling that Gelman. Sparo may die, and if he does not tell, he will die. How to choose is not a problem to consider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the scorpion is lost, it will be lost, my life is more important! Dakwell thought confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he saw Galman Sparo revealing a polite smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your humor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This joke is not bad. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......This is not a joke... Dakwell looked down at the ring box and saw that there was no change in the red blood."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it not be convincing that there will be enough reasons for persuasion to fail... fat pharmacist Horan becomes desperate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Really! He is telling the truth! "Owl Harry is flapping his wings.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell, who has emerged hope, hears that Gelman Sparrow is low:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you throw it into the sea?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Klein politely closed the door and walked back to the living room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy Definitely hiding the secret, can't be deceived by his lame reason... Klein sat in the chair, waiting for Dakwell to say more specific and detailed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell re-sit back in dismay, not moving, afraid of failure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not find that the dice changed again The face that faces up, this time is 3 o'clock.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before lunch, Klein enters the bathroom and empties.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After washing his hands, he enters the fog and prepares to browse the accumulated "Poseidon" believers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just sat down to belong to " The high chair of the Fool, suddenly recalled many details in my mind, and my eyes widened.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, how can I believe so can not withstand scrutiny Argument...<br /><br />&nb Sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
