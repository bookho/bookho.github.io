Banson asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa is looking at her brother seriously, because she thinks that Klein’s performance tonight is equally weird, only a little better than Elizabeth and later Selena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about his words, hehe laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There was an error in the description, and I have already submitted my colleague to the company as soon as possible. So, either change it now, or get up early for at least half an hour tomorrow. No doubt, I choose the former."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I always felt that you didn't concentrate enough on playing cards. It turned out to be thinking about work." Benson suddenly realized and immediately smiled. "No, I apologize, I should say this, playing cards." It helps to think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, we will wait for you." Melissa took back the sight of the shot and raised her hand to arrange the lower leg sleeves. Ruffled edge. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the operation time of the tracked and trackless public carriages was over, the brothers and sisters had to leave the door and had to hire a rental carriage, 2 Soules for 45 minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that every driver who rents a horse-drawn carriage will indiscriminately increase the price." Benson will lose most of the money he won after he paid it out. Complaining a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it’s acceptable, it’s almost 11 o’clock now. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just made a joke. My current thinking is that we can actually hire together and, with other guests, can go to many places in 45 minutes." Benson looked at the people who hired the carriages outside the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, carpooling... Kleinmo’s silver-plated pattern at the top of the cane:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We have no problems, but other guests have, Banson, have you not found out? They are very focused on their own image, very concerned about the 'decent' thing, I think, this may be the commonality of the middle class."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Banson nodded seriously. "The Wood House is also more luxurious than I thought. However, Oldwood’s salary is only 4 pounds a week... Oh, decent. Perhaps it is the biggest difference between some middle class and the curled owl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a trick to provoke you... Klein couldn’t hold back the smile . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa did not join their discussion, sit in the position, and look at Klein from time to time, seeing his heart slightly hairy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light two-wheeled carriage drove fast on a quiet, dim street and arrived in Zouteland Street in just 12 minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are here waiting for me, five minutes, no more than five minutes, I will come back." Klein stressed again, put on a hat and put a cane Go down the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is time, not distance, the coachman has no opinion on waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the stairs, Klein came outside the Black Thorough Security Company and slammed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than ten seconds, the door opened back, and Leonard Mitchell, who wore a vest and a shirt, appeared in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to be on duty tonight." Leonard stressed awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein only needs to rotate the Chanis Gate every day for the rest of the day, and the rest of the time can still maintain normal work, as for the night's emergency, by the "sleepless" who likes the night "We are taking it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sleeping for only two or three hours a day can cause hair loss and memory loss... Whenever you think of it, Klein can’t help but squat the captain Dunn Smith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have something to report," he said simply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a mission?" Leonard asked for a position at the door and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just walked into the reception hall and saw Dunn coming out in a black trench coat. The ashes were as deep as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, I have encountered an extraordinary event."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Details." Dunn asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein said the previous things and their own originals:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Therefore, I think it is necessary to investigate Hainas Vansente."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was thinking that since the "magic mirror divination" invited evil things I haven't made a tragedy yet, and I haven't gotten the danger of being extremely dangerous. It means that the other party may need time, not willing to wake up in advance or control Selena, so as long as it does not directly expose its purpose, the evil thing It is definitely a priority to wait and see. In this case, it is not too difficult for Elizabeth to seduce Selena to the bedroom door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have handled it very well, and seized the opportunity that the evil spirit has not yet fully arrived, and has not fully possessed it." Dunn sighed softly. The next investigation is handed over to us, you can go back to rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein breathed a sigh of relief, hehe laughed:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought the captain would use this as my enrollment task, let me do it alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the mantra provided by Elizabeth, Hainas Vansente is dangerous...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is because your enrollment mission already has "The casual casual Leonard laughed aside." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Klein was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den’s mouth is upturned, and the voice is mellow and explained:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, we received a case transferred from the police station, initially confirming that there is no danger, no urgency, so I plan to let you finish it alone tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't ask what the case is, take a good night's sleep, and your rest day will be moved to Tuesday or Wednesday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, you are like this, I sleep more No, it’s not good... And, Monday afternoon is the date of the Tarot gathering... Is it necessary to postpone the “message” in advance for “justice” and “downside down”? Klein shook his head and smiled and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the stairs, he suddenly noticed, looked up at the carriage he had hired, and saw that Melissa was quietly looking through the window. Yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being in contact with the line of sight, Melissa turned her head and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein’s mouth was fretting and pretended to have gone into the carriage without happening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the blushing moon and the pure night sky, the two-wheeled carriages traveled lightly through the streets one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he got home, Klein asked Benson to take a shower first, and he came to the door of Melissa’s bedroom and raised his hand twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa, who is planning to go to another bathroom, opens the door and looks at her brother in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melissa, do you have anything to ask? I know, you have." Klein spoke directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not always observe secretly...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa lips twitched a few times, slightly frowning Head: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein, what did you do to Elizabeth? I feel she is not right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"And, Selena later became very strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had prepared to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know that Elizabeth and Selena are occult enthusiasts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...know, but I don't I like, I don’t think there is anything in the world that is incomprehensible.” Melissa snorted and answered seriously, “All that we don’t understand is because we don’t have enough knowledge.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I think so too." Klein reconciled with a guilty conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to think so until I succeeded...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coughed Two, continue to say: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mystery contains Hermes, this is the special text of ancient sacrifices and prayers, Elizabeth knows that I am good at this, oh, after all, This is the field of historians, so I asked a few words and specific meanings for the pronunciation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa nodded slightly, to this brother The explanation indicates acceptance because it is in line with her understanding of both parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for Elizabeth and Selena, why did it become weird, I don't know the specific reason." Klein said before he clarified himself, "but I can guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you guess?" Melissa was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein raised his hand and snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked me from Elizabeth The content to guess, the few Hermes that she said are related to divination, and related to some evil sacrifices. Well, when Selena was divination, did she miss Hermes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the initiative to mention this thing, just to let his sister be wary of similar things in the future, if it can stay away from Selena and Elizabeth, then it is even better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." Melissa replied hesitantly. "I think I understand the eccentricity of Elizabeth and Selena..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein deliberately asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because Selena’s mirror divination involves evil Illegal faith, after I figured out the specific meaning of Hermione from me, I found an opportunity to blame the other party and correct the other party's mistakes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I think so." Melissa had no doubt about this conclusion because she reasoned it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing his own induction, Klein breathed a sigh of relief:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say more to Selena, let her return to the right path of faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he said this, he was very pastor on the chest. Four times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will!" Melissa replied firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, don't take our guess, don't tell Elizabeth and Selena what I said, I originally promised Elizabeth not to tell you." Klein finally stressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Melissa nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday at 8 am, Blackthorn Security Company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took off his hat and greeted Rosanne and Brett. After the weather, he entered the office of Captain Dunn Smith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed open the door and looked up, suddenly shocked, because Dunn’s face was quite pale, the ashes were slightly muddy and lost. The depth of the usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? Hainas. Vincent?" Klein asked in surprise and with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng’s forehead licked his forehead and sipped his coffee and said with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nas. Vincent is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who was killed early?" Kline took a cane and sat opposite Dunn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun did not answer directly, and sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I and Leonard yesterday I went to Hynas. Vincent because I didn't show any abnormal signs at home, and there was no strange place in the family, so I decided to enter his dreams first to find clues."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
