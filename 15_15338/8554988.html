			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens, the luxury villa of Earl of Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top-level Fenetport St. Desi Mountain coffee has a strong aroma, and the beautiful taste of the queen black tea has become an intoxicating scent. Awesome and delicate desserts are adorned with an elegant three-tiered bracket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Audrey's afternoon tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her aristocratic friends in occultism should come around and sit around and smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Audrey quietly guided, Jane, Murray and others had a strong interest in the Grand Theft Auto "Black Emperor" who appeared last night, and they turned their attention to Joined the aristocratic son of the MI9, Const Lersen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any extraordinary ability of the 'Black Emperor'?" asked Christine, who was sweet and sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fathers of several of them are at least viscounts, so that they like occultism have enough status and channels to understand the existence of extraordinary power and potions, but they are all Like Audrey, I was reluctant to join the night servants, the punitives, the mechanical heart and the military squad. I was not willing to waste a lot of time on performing official duties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the family they belong to can not be traced back to the millennium, even the ancient aristocracy of the Quaternary Lun Kingdom just established the meeting, not completely If you die in the royal family or become a high-ranking military, you will not receive the recipe. Even if there are extraordinary materials, you may not recognize it. You don't know how to use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This limits the possibility that Murray, Christine and others become extraordinary, so that they can only yearn for it, but it is difficult to take that critical step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether their elders have privately collected potions and cultivated a few extraordinary people belonging to the family, it is not something they can understand. After all, this is not the case. Being allowed, it is really necessary for the king to seize the handle, and it is entirely possible to deprive the title of the title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, at this moment in the living room, there are already two betrayers, respectively, who have promoted the sequence of 8 "readers" and collected When it comes to an extraordinary material, it will take a long time to become the "pharmacist" of the Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin, young gentleman, Const, took a sip of coffee:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't do positive The answer, I just tell you some facts:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the restaurant where the battle took place, in addition to the traces of gas explosions, the toxins and avatars were detected by various means. The elements of the screaming screams, the bullets of the divine power, and so on, the 'black emperor', no, the Grand Theft Auto, is in a ghost state. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not like killing the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qilingus, nor is it like solving the Llanus in the sewer... ... stealing the "Black Emperor" card, the third person who created the "King of the Fool" in the Kaping case? It is only Beckland, he has at least three prostitutes... How many people will he have in total? Li Xin’s first move, deliberately ignorant and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a fierce and extraordinary battle there? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murray, under her guidance, asked further:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kaping Are there extraordinary people in the family? More powerful extraordinary? Not even more than one? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is just a trafficker..." Viscount Glylint unconsciously expressed doubts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey maintains a light smile and curious eyes, waiting patiently for Const's answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cons smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Murray’s guess is correct, I can only say so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want me to be confined by the team leader?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kaping has More powerful extraordinary people, not only one...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, he is not an ordinary trafficker, he may have involved many mysterious events...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trafficking population... Is he involved in cult worship? The leader of Mr. Fool's is this one?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Larousus is almost the same Involving cults, involving sacrifices, involving the 'real creator' coming... Kapyeong does not know which cult is a cult god...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal seems to be aimed at the evil spirits... Is it really a game between the gods? He doesn't know how many things have been destroyed by those evil gods...” Audrey associates a lot, and the heart is gradually awkward:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy of our Tarot will be the evil spirit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are not qualified! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to get the title of "Fable God Buster"? Audrey grinned and chuckled in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, she put away her emotions and secretly repented one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey, how are you? Can this be? How can I make a joke with Mr. Fool...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at noon, Klein returns Minsk Street, no accidentally found a letter from the old letterer in the letter box to ask a driver to send. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is their emergency contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, according to Klein’s expectations, the old Kohler who does not know the words will only tell you when to meet by simple symbols, who knows, the stationery spreads out. After that, it was actually a neat text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a glance, Klein confirmed that this is consistent with the writing on the Daisy book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this girl wrote for the old Kohler... This paper is not infiltrated by moisture, maybe the old Kohler specially bought some, For an emergency contact... Klein opened the door and walked into the living room while reading the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t take off his coat, just picked up his hat and leaned on his cane. This is because the fireplace in the room has not been ignited, and the cold in early November is silent. Drill into the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the letter is very simple, after all, there are not many words in the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She first thanked Mr. Detective for his kindness and kindness, then told Klein that he had returned home safely, and finally euphemistically said that he hopes that Mr. Detective will come next time. In the Eastern District, you can bring the word book by the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A polite girl... Klein chuckled, snapped a finger and burned the letter without leaving any clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to go to the Eastern District tomorrow, return the word book to Daisy, and reimburse the old Kohler’s delivery fee and paper pen expense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it, he couldn’t help but sigh, laughing low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, now It’s my turn to reimburse others for expenses...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only one last minute finishing work, and Klein suddenly fell idle. He didn’t waste time and went out again. Going directly to the Cragg Club - Dr. Allen appeared there on Friday afternoon, and Klein wanted to ask about the situation of the tarot-born child Will Anthony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the Cragg Club in the Hillston District, Klein told the red vest waiter:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A cup of Marquis black tea, a dessert, sent to the corner of the hall, where Dr. Allen and Mike reporters sit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Ryan has seen Alan Kreis, a well-known surgeon who wears gold-rimmed glasses, and has worked twice, and has a pair of glamorous blue-eyed Daily Observer reporter Mike Joseph, and only appeared in the club. Second to Sherlock Moriatti's aristocratic equestrian teacher Tallim Dumont. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, our big detective is coming, just to say you." Talim laughed and got up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking bad about me?" Klein made a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
