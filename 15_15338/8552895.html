			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On October 29th, the leader of the Secret Society, Charato, visited me again. He did not mention the specific things, just chatted casually. Yes, I can't guess his true intentions. He seems to just want to strengthen communication and understanding of each other?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen two churches high The strong sequencer, I feel that the Charato is stronger and more mysterious than them, so I asked him without any hope and asked him to be in the sequence. As a result, he even answered me!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said that he is the 'miracle teacher' of sequence 2!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 2? In the division of the church This is an angelic step, a person close to the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough than the 'Alchemist' and 'Mystery Scholars' I saw before!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I intuitively think that Charato does not say all the truth, sequence 2 may be just his previous position, or he Promotion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miracle? A master who is good at creating miracles? The name of this potion is imaginative!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the sequence 2 of the 'Divination', the miracle of manipulating fate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I tried and asked again Chalatu, is the so-called miracle a miracle of fate? Is the 'Divination' approach a way to gradually understand destiny, master destiny, and manipulate destiny?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Latu skips the first question. He tells me that fate is only part of the 'divination' approach, not even the subject. The way to truly represent fate is 'monster'!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He gave a few examples for this, both the 'monster' sequence of the potion name, the sequence 7 'lucky', the sequence 5 'winner', the sequence 2 'prophet', and the top of the sequence That 1, 'Silver of the Mercury'! This is also known as the 'Snake of Destiny'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the first I know. Sequence 1, completely poked me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I know, the 'monster' path should be controlled by the life school, this school seems to have The partial sequence of the 'pharmacist' approach, they advocate the triple division of the absolute rational world, the spiritual world and the material world, um, pretty cool. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charlat tells me that the life school is good at astrology, pursuing the use of medicine, music, light, wine and aroma to reconcile the soul and eliminate the unfavorable fate of the astrology. It is believed that disasters and diseases are caused by the imbalance between the human and the natural level and the human and the spiritual level. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He also made a meaningful addition, the life school worshipped the moon. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is it the worship of the moon, not the further night goddess? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This diary occupies two pages, apparently also copied from the original front and back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The amount of information is very large..." Klein sighed in a heartless manner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the first time he knows the sequence 1 level potion Name.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Silver of the Mercury” and “Snake of Destiny” are really easy to make people want!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"And this is the first time I know a sequence 2, know the sequence of the 'Divination' 2... 'The miracle' is not bad, the meaning is rich, the personality is not low, of course, than From the 'prophet', it feels a little bit worse..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Destiny is only part of the 'divination' approach, not even the subject, I have to remember this One point, always look at yourself and not go to the fate, which may lead to failure... The words of Zaratu are confirmed before and after, no problem... 'Monsters' The path is the real road to destiny... 'Prophet' was originally sequence 2, so think about it, I used to know a sequence 2..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Although Ryan’s gaze has not been removed from the paper, he has seriously thought about the serial chain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for whether Charato is lying, Klein is certain that the "monster" route is definitely a sequence of fate, which is consistent with the description he saw from the internal data of the night, and also the magic he had heard. The name of the drug is "Prophet." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there is a sequence of fate, the "Treasure" approach will not repeat with the other party, which will cause some overlap, and the current The different characteristics of the sequence are inconsistent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Klein tends to believe in the words of Charato, tending to believe that fate is only part of the "divination" approach, not even the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of these two diaries is immeasurable to me now... "Alchemist" and "Mystery Scholar" should be a high sequence of "General" pathways From the perspective of Russell's tone, they certainly do not belong to sequence 2 and sequence 1, that is, a sequence of 4, a sequence of 3... temporarily unable to determine who is the sequence 4, who is the sequence 3... Klein retracts his thoughts , flip the diary and read down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why the life school only worships the moon and does not believe in the goddess of the night symbolizing the moon of blush, he is unable to think deeply because of the lack of corresponding information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third page diary is the heart of Russell’s invention of a practical steam engine. He is worried that he will be suppressed, and he will be afraid that the results will be captured by the big guys. Others want to persecute him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Russell the Great, who thought that the protagonist of the era, was so embarrassed, so worried... Klein moved his mouth and turned to the fourth page diary: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On April 18, Matilda was pregnant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Unexpectedly, I can even say which bride she was in, because I felt the reduction of extraordinary characteristics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Once the pregnancy is successful, my own extraordinary characteristics will follow mysterious connections and transfer parts to my children.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“After that time, I was worried Archbishop Van Austin, he told me that this is a normal phenomenon, sequence 7 and below, extraordinary characteristics will not be passed on to future generations, but not absolute, sequence 6 and sequence 5 will naturally inherit part of it, but not much, Will not affect its own strength too much, and that child will have a certain extraordinary ability to be close to the sequence 9, but correspondingly, he The path is fixed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To the high sequence, the inheritance of extraordinary characteristics is something that can be controlled, can be genetic, or not genetic, or you can choose Inheritance, one-third, half, or all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, children with high sequence strengths may be born to be extraordinary, as for sequences It is up to his father or mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if the descendants of the gods are also like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After reading this diary, Kline has only two phrases in his mind: "The Law of Extraordinary Characters" and the Law of Conservation of Extraordinary Characters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the survival rule of those supernatural creatures? It is no wonder that some magical animals are produced before dying... No wonder there will be a phenomenon of killing and bloodthirsty after childbirth. The goal is to have the same family and even a partner. This is to supplement the extraordinary characteristics... According to this logic, it is always up. Push, where did the earliest extraordinary features come from? Produced out of thin air? Create all the Creator? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Miss "Justice" has been promoted to "Reader", Klein controls the urge to nod and continues to read backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth page diary is Russell’s spit, no one can appreciate his pop music here, he thinks he is making noise, at the same time, he feels Shuangwen is the common pursuit of different people in different worlds. The plagiarism of the novel "The Count of Monte Cristo" is so popular that the newspaper he founded has flourished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The Great, what else are you not doing? Klein turned to the sixth page with a smile, which is the last page:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On November 10th, I met secretly at Baifeng Palace. Pirate Savigny Solomon, I hope he will rob my opponents on the new waterway against the ships of Fossac, Lun and Fenetport."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
