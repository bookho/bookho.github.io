			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Brown bear-like Tolle was shocked, looked at Klein, and looked at the room again, with a kind of The agile gesture rushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the white cloth covered with the body and examined it several times. He relaxed his breath:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It’s not too big a problem as I imagined it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I should pull out the revolver and send Mr. Maynard a five-hundred demon bullet Look at the problem is not serious... Klein whispered, pointing to the outside: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't had anything after me?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Tolle screamed. "You wait a little longer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is puzzled The ground asks: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teller is very serious and explains very seriously: "We must prevent accidents, wait for Mrs. Shelen, make a statement, and I will send you back to Zouteland Street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May died more than 10 hours Nader can "live" and what else can't happen? You are gone, what should I do? Tolle silently added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein slammed his forehead. "You find a quiet room for me to rest."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was promoted to a day in all aspects of his state is still unstable, just held several ceremonies, using two spells, and was not scared, so you must meditate as soon as possible to eliminate the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Klein is extremely wary of "out of control." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teller will be a little relaxed on the White Bra:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He led Klein into the room near the Sunshine House, pointing to the inside:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Moretti Inspector, you can rest assured that no one will bother you, I will go to Mrs. Shelen first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded slightly and watched each other Leave, then close the door and close the curtains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dimly and quiet bedroom, he walked slowly to the rocking chair and lay down comfortably, letting the body swing rhythmically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless balls of light illusion gathered in my mind, and the snoring of the Klein and the pain of the head disappeared little by little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the state was stable, he opened his eyes and looked at the furniture, such as beds and cabinets, which were outlined in the darkness, and summed up the previous attempts: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Several flamboyant jokes didn't get 'feedback' for a while..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I haven't really controlled the power of the 'Clown' potion, and there are negative effects on it... Of course, this does not rule out the possibility of playing a small role."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "...I personally are not very happy to play the 'clown', but since I have chosen this sequence, I can only go down the scalp..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "In fact, everyone in life has more or less become a 'clown', not too repulsive..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get it clear as soon as possible" What is the core element of the clown's..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various ideas rolling in, and Klein suddenly pulls out a brass-colored penny. Denominations of one-half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He habitually wants to divination whether there is an extraordinary factor in the death of Maynard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be an occupational disease... Klein shakes his head and laughs, turning his eyes deeper and repeating his thoughts:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The death of John Maynard is influenced by extraordinary factors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;铮! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lying on the rocking chair, he popped the penny coin and watched its brass-colored body flickering in the dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! The coin is right in Klein's palm, and one-half of the number is facing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Negative...that is to say, John Maynard’s death does not have the influence of extraordinary factors... This guy seems to be really happy to die... ...the deceased is big, I don't need to laugh at him in Chinese proverbs..." Klein took the coin and emptied his brain in the dark, dark room, and almost slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚,咚,咚. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a slow, rhythmic percussion, Klein sorted out his clothes, put on a bonnet with a police coat of arms, left the lounge chair, and walked slowly to the door. side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right palm just touched the handrail, and a picture appeared in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The brown bear-like Tolre inspector stood outside the door, pulled the neckline, and there was obvious confusion and helplessness in his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning the handle, Klein opened the door without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tole Inspector appeared in his eyes and pulled the collar:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very sorry , let you wait too long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have already looked for Mrs. Shelen, recorded a statement, you can return to Zouteland Street." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am really sorry, delaying your precious time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't ask The reason for the current emotional situation of the other party, and then smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Shelen admitted to being with Mr. Maynard last night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, she said that under the catalysis of a large amount of alcohol, she and Mrs. Maynard could not control themselves for a while, and after discovering that the other party was killed, she was very scared and handled it a little. I escaped from the room and hid back to my own room. We don’t have enough reason to accuse her of committing crimes. We can only let her leave, limit certain freedom, and wait for further anatomical results.” Tolre Inspector in detail Said channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slightly shifted his head and smiled sharply:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you explaining to? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tole stunned and immediately smiled and said: "Yeah, I don't need to explain anything to you. I was bored by Mrs. Maynard." Only subconsciously said so much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Maynard’s wife is back?" Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, unfortunately, today's steam train is unusual, not late." Tolle made a positive answer by joking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't ask more questions. After checking whether the belongings were complete, they followed the Tolre Inspector to the stairs and returned to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you arrest her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a murderer! I want to sue She, I want to sue you for your misconduct!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to ask the best barrister to sue you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shrill voice was introduced into Klein’s ear, and he subconsciously looked and saw a plump day in the living room area. The middle-aged woman, with the support of two young people, glared at the opposite side and kept reprimanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beckland's popular court dress this year..." often sees "Ms. Aesthetics", the magazine's Klein first emerged such an anachronism The idea then saw a woman who was protected behind by several gentlemen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady is wearing a long black dress, the skin is white and tender, the brown hair is like a waterfall, and the brown eyelids are as pure and pitiful as the deer in the forest. I want to care for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Shelen... Klein suddenly remembered the "small dirty film" starring the other side, and raised her right hand, holding it against her mouth and coughing twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He professionally let the left tooth squint twice, using "Lingshi" to observe the presence of everyone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Maynard’s body has some minor problems, the color of the gas field is relatively thin... From her emotional color, she can intuitively feel her anger and her hatred... This is very consistent with her external performance. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咦, Mrs. Shelen’s emotional color is blue that represents rational thinking and calm state... This is contrary to her panic and nervousness. ... Sure enough, the person who can become a social flower is definitely not a little white rabbit... Her body is very healthy...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review is complete, Klein is waiting to withdraw his sight, Suddenly, Mrs. Shelen quickly looked up and glanced at her direction, then lowered her head again, a timid trembling look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can't visually see your emotional color, I'm afraid I will be bullied by your performance... You should consider moving towards the "actor"... In the abdomen, Klein did not stop, and walked out of the house of Mr. Maynard with Tolre inspector and took the carriage arranged by the police station to return to Zouteland Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After replacing the captain, he continued to rotate the Chanis Gate and took the opportunity to handwritten a reimbursement request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night, Klein returned to the ground in the morning and took the breakfast she had entrusted to her from the hands of Rosanne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like this pie!" He praised it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of breakfast, he has given the other party in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? I can try it tomorrow!" Roshan responded with delight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein’s mouth twitched and focused on milk and pie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When at 8:25, he yawned and resisted drowsiness and went to the nearby shooting club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had an appointment with the madhouse doctor Dast Gudrian to meet at this point in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the small shooting range, Klein and Dast each aimed at the target and finished a round of bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang, Dast shakes out the shell and looks at Klein with interest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are more confident than before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I am promoted to Sequence 8, with practical ability... Kline’s heart reflects himself Facial expressions and physical movements, deliberately showing a arrogant attitude:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I have mastered the power of the potion in just over a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dast’s invisible snoring: “Although this is something to be proud of, it doesn’t need to be on the go.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, as an "audience", you didn't even see through my performance... So, the "clown" is quite capable of restraining the "audience"... Klein has some Recognizing smiled and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is Hood Eugen's recent state?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...He really "It’s crazy." Dast said silently for a second. "I tried him in various ways. He is really crazy. I am thinking about giving him the right medicine to see if he can cure him."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the "psychologist" of Sequence 7, even pretending to be a mental patient... Even if there is a certain therapeutic behavior, it does not meet the core elements of the name of the potion... This is vague and It’s not particularly strange to use the "playing method" wrongly... Klein thought about it: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before he went crazy, who has been in contact? He, have you found it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to the madhouse doctors, patients, nurses and handymen, no outsiders have contacted him." Dast answered affirmatively Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
