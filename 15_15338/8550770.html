			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, Klein, who returned home, pulled the curtains and left the bedroom in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned out the pen and paper, thought for a long time, and finally wrote a paragraph:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Llight’s kidnapping case is guided by extraordinary factors.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a “divinationist”, Klein had actually had divination before those few things that seemed coincidental Whether there is unnatural development, and the results prove that he wants more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, influenced by Azick faculty, he also attached importance to this problem, and absorbed the lessons of the tuxedo clown, carefully designed the "Divination Statement", from Start by excluding some vague, confusing descriptions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, break down the three coincidences, each divination..." Klein nodded thoughtfully and slowly removed the citrine pendant from his cuff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held the pendulum with his left hand, letting the pendant hang over the "divination statement" on the paper, almost touching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Converging the mind, entering meditation, Klein closed his eyes and began to repeat the meditation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Laughter kidnapping case is guided by extraordinary factors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over and over again, He opened his eyes and looked at the spirit, only to see the citrine pendant rotating slightly counterclockwise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or negative..." Klein whispered and redesigned the "Divination Statement" several times, but the result is still that there is no coincidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also divined the "Riel Bieber detention in Timing" incident, "Selina magic mirror divination incident", the answer is "normal" ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, as a true divinationist, I was caught by Mr. Azick’s fake god? Besides, the captains did not feel weird... Klein smiled and shook his head, but still took a cautious attitude and prepared to use the "dream divination" to make a final confirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a moment, he changed the "Divination Statement" to suit different methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The real cause of Eliot’s kidnapping." Pens brushed and wrote, and Klein paused and used words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading it over and over again, he tore off the paper, got up and walked over to the bed, lying down and relaxing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "Divination Statement", Klein quickly fell asleep with meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a twisted, fragmented world, he recovered some of his consciousness and wandered there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, he saw the kidnappers and saw that they lost the last chip at the gambling table and saw that they got the guns from the underground channel and saw They stepped on the spot several times and temporarily rented the opposite house of Riel Bieber’s house as a hiding place...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is not coherent, it is a flash of the picture, but Klein could not find a place to break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this is basically consistent with the kidnapping confession he learned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exiting dreams, Klein separately divined two other things, the results are the same, development is in line with the rules, coincidence is really just a coincidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really what I think, Mr. Azick is just a diviner..." Klein swayed and shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was about to open the curtains, let the afternoon sun shine into the bedroom, and the fingertips suddenly stopped here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the impression of the original master, Azick faculty is a reliable, trustworthy gentleman who almost never speaks unfounded words, even if he often Disputing with the tutor, it is limited to academic issues, and there are different reasons... If you are just a simple diviner, he will not communicate with me in this way... and the original owner simply does not remember that he loves divination... Of course It is also possible that the corresponding memory fragments are missing..." Klein frowned, always felt that he was still not at ease, and always wanted to find a way to confirm it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do to find out again?" Klein paced back and forth in the dimly lit bedroom where he could barely see the text of the book, recalling other divinities he had mastered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One step, two steps, three steps, he suddenly stopped, with an idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before assuming that there is a problem with coincidence, my divination is not a sequence is not high enough, is subject to external interference, then you can change the environment, change A more mysterious and incomprehensible environment than these things!” Kline’s spirit rose, pulling the drawer and taking out a silver knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he accumulates the spirit, letting the spirit flow from the tip of the silver enamel, and integrates with the surrounding nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his pace, the wall of spirituality gradually sealed the entire bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s plan is to divination on the fog, to the mysterious world of divination! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gloom of the gray mist, the magnificent ancient temple Among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s figure sits at the top of the bronze long table, with a piece of parchment that has just been “presented”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted the round pen and wrote the "Divination Statement" according to the previous attempt:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Elliot's kidnapping case is guided by extraordinary factors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand holding a pendulum, hanging pendant, Klein let his spirit quickly precipitate, quiet And ethereal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He half-closed his eyes, meditation seven times of "Divination Statement", so that spirituality and the spiritual world above all else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the slight pull of the silver chain, Klein stared at the spirit,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At this point, he suddenly fell there: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citrine pendant is turning clockwise! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that Eliot’s kidnapping case is guided by extraordinary factors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly the opposite of Klein’s divination in the outside world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no trace of guidance... This power, or means, is terrible... What is the purpose of the people behind the scenes? Are the Antignus family notes entangled with my fate? Klein’s heart screamed and lost his silence, turning the spirits into chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the citrine pendant, pinched his eyebrows, and his expression was extremely dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a few seconds, he did not try to divination two other things, but wrote a new "Divination Statement":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The real cause of Eliot’s kidnapping."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold the paper, meditate seven times, Klein goes back Leaning on the back of the chair, I entered the sleep on the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he saw an innocent, illusory, grayish mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog is slowly separated, revealing colorful flowers and green lawns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the back of the flowers and lawn, the space is twisted and overlapped, just like a living monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein tried to look at it and barely saw a dark red chimney hidden there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, everything in front of his eyes collapsed and the dreams collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magnificent temple, Klein suddenly bounced straight back, only to feel the heart is jumping, no reason to jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
