			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road made of cement is dirty due to the long rainy weather. The gas lamps on the sides of the adult men are bright and bright due to the wetness of the glass cover. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rental carriage travels in the night, surrounded by pedestrians or wearing a hat or umbrella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned against the wall and was free to admire the Beckland street at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he suddenly felt that the temperature inside the compartment dropped a lot, and the cold wind swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein suddenly turned his head and saw that the bodyguard wearing a black gothic court dress did not know when he was sitting opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She whispered and said whisperingly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'eye of wisdom' has noticed me The existence of "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough... Klein did not accidentally click down: "He has several magical items, perhaps by these things, I I even suspect that there is an organization behind him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, relying on the power of the "eye of wisdom" itself, even if it took more than 30 years, It is unlikely to collect several relatively powerful magical items. The former "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qi Lingus, as one of the seven pirate generals, has only one "squirming hunger". Of course, the latter is more likely It is a high vision, not to look at the general magical items, after all, relying on "squirming hunger" can be comprehensive and there is no weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the eye of wisdom is rich and reasonable. It’s a reasonable explanation. Organize so many parties and find the right magic items to win at no cost. Over the years, there have been several collections that are not too ridiculous... Hey, this is the rhythm of having mines at home, or opening a bank... Klein spoke in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not specifically mention that he actually guessed that "the eye of wisdom" is the church of steam and machinery, or the church of the god of knowledge and wisdom, afraid of being a bodyguard The exposure in front of us is not the fact that we have just become extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light-haired haired bodyguard lady is slightly beheaded and seems to agree with Klein’s suspicions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, her brow wrinkled and looked at the opposite window:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thick bloody smell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very bloody... Klein wonders and looks out the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sparsely thin rain, there is a secluded alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the mouth of the alley, a woman wearing a gorgeous long dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a pedestrian passed by, carefully glanced at it and suddenly screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the scream, the horse was a little scared, and the driver quickly tightened the reins, and the speed of the carriage slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the light of the gas street lamp, Klein saw that the woman who fell on the ground in the alley had a pale face and a deep mouth in the abdomen. The internal organs seemed to be People are short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood around her ground is slowly flowing, red and full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... As a qualified former night singer, he quickly thought of a lot of similar examples of modus operandi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These examples are often related to demon worship! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to demon worship, it is difficult to circumvent an ancient organization, first appeared in the Quaternary "Bai Xuejiao"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the records, this is a loose alliance formed by worshipping demons. There are several so-called demon families inside, such as North, Andrreal And the Beria family, they do not belong to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a persistent spread of the demon faith, creating a lot of bloody cases, and Mrs. Oliana, the accountant of the Tingen City Night Club, is one of the victims. But fortunately got saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not all similar cases are made by them. Many people think that those things are cool and start to imitate crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like a bloody religion." The bodyguard whispered a word, the figure was fast and transparent and disappeared. understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the carriage has crossed the crime scene, and Klein also found a patrolling policeman coming in, so he stopped the idea of ​​getting off the bus and thinking of himself. It is an ordinary citizen passing by. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ah, the public Mr. Moriarty ...... <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; thanks to teach blood holds the "criminals" The route, also known as the demon route, is said to be devilized after the sequence 7, but only in certain circumstances and specific circumstances...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Sequence9, "criminal", has a strong body, keen intuition and a variety of criminal abilities, but the conscience has not been annihilated... Sequence 8, the ancient name "cold-blooded", the modern name is "winged angel", meaning It is the loss of conscience, the same flow of evil desires, the body is more inhuman, and can get some magical spell-like abilities... Sequence 7, "serial killer", masters many knowledge and rituals of worshiping demons, prefers to use special links homicide to please the devil ...... <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; sequence and then further, I do not know what it is ...... <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp ;&nbsp;About the blood culture, the knowledge about the devil's path flashed through Klein's mind, and the drizzle outside seemed to be a little bigger. The rain on the windows gathered and fell, and the whole world became quiet and not clear enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to do so much, this kind of thing will definitely have a small team to take over, maybe a punisher, maybe a night eater, don't need me to worry Klein shook his head and laughed, and groaned in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he returned to No. 15 Minsk Street, he had already thrown the case just now, first to knock the door of Samuel’s house next door, please Mrs. Starling transferred to Mary, let her come to the evidence tomorrow afternoon, and then read the newspaper to understand the current situation and various news of Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, that is, Saturday morning, Klein used breakfast slowly, went out to take the photo that had just been washed out, and picked one to see the most. Doragu Gale and Elika Taylor face the most enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting the photo in place, he grabbed Mrs. Mary in front of the door and went to the police station in Leslie, and went back to the 10 bail bail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the process, he still saw the real Sheriff Sheriff there, quite a bit uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking out the remaining £500 in the account, Klein, who had been busy for a whole morning, had nothing to lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before preparing lunch, he gave the remaining £600 to the bodyguard in one go, and there was a total of 146 pounds, 8 sul 5 pennies left. All the property he can use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Miss Justice, there is no debt... Klein relaxedly grilled his boned steak and poured black pepper sauce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was in a good mood to taste the taste of the seven-point cooked, the doorbell was suddenly rang, and the sound of the jingle echoed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Mary? Too early?" Klein puzzled and lowered his knife and fork to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused for two seconds, and his mind naturally emerged as a visitor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an old-school gentleman wearing a light gray coat, a half-high silk hat, and a black gold cane. He has sharp blue eyes and a smudge On a little bit of white, the decree is deeply engraved on the face, making the muscles look drooping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me, which one are you looking for?" Klein asked as he opened the door. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; The old school gentleman with a thick accent Road between the east coast of the sea: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "you are the summer "Lot Moriarty Detective?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have something to trust?" Klein nodded, let the road open, and led the old gentleman. Go to the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hesitated for two seconds, still asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want coffee, or black tea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"A cup of hot water, thank you." The old gentleman had taken off his hat and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very good, this is very simple... Maybe I have to consider asking an assistant to add tea to the water and clean the room... Kline’s thoughts are divergent, Turned to the kitchen and rinsed a cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the hot water in front of the old gentleman, walked to the single sofa, and sat down with his hands:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do I call you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miller Carter." The old gentleman replied succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Carter, what do you want to commission?" Klein asked without asking me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he quietly turned on the vision and observed the opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old gentleman’s body is still healthy, the color of the left leg joints is a bit problematic, probably arthritis... The mood is calm blue Lord, with some anxiety... Klein just swept his eyes and he reached a conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller Carter picks up the white porcelain cup and rubs the outer road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is the case. I bought a house in Williams Street. Oh, I am from Kamihain. I will settle in Bakerland for business reasons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Williams Street...Where? Less than a month before going to Beckland, go out and check the map or rely on the intuitive Klein to make yourself stand and feel reliable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller Carter glanced at him and continued with his gaze:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The house is said to have been a bankrupt prince. This is probably something twenty or thirty years ago. After several changes, I was finally bought by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I intend to do a retrofit with modern style. I found that there is a hidden dark door in the basement that leads to a large underground building. I think that it may be unsafe, temporarily stop the construction and prevent the workers. Exploring with the servants, I hope that you can help confirm the condition inside the underground building."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underground architecture...Ancient ruins? Secret treasure? Klein thought for a moment: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you call the police?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police can The resources mobilized are several hundred times more than a private detective. The effect of exploration will definitely be better and more assured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller Carter The position between the two eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want too many people to know about this, especially the government department."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are sure that there is no danger inside the underground building, I intend to re-plan it as part of the whole house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I know, this is a higher risk for you. I am willing to pay 50 pounds for this, but you can't find more than three assistants. Afterwards, I can make some compensation according to the specific experience. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50 pounds, the price is very high... If I am an ordinary detective, this is equivalent to my income for two or three months...he early Beckland, who doesn't know other detectives, can only look at the newspapers to hire people, so I found me... Klein took a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly showed a sorry smile and pointed to the back: "I went to the bathroom."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller Carter nodded invisibly and drank hot water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the bathroom, closing the wooden door, Klein looked at the mirror and pulled out a half-penny copper coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is a bodyguard, he can't confirm it on the fog, so he has to rely on his own divination level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
