Is it because I can't find it for some reason, or is it really not? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the assassination of Russell the Great to the present for more than 150 years, there is still no trace of oil...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's pupil shrinks, and the hand holding the diary almost shakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no oil, not only means that the emergence of internal combustion engines will become unknown, but also lead to the stagnation of the chemical industry, so that the true modern industry of the earth can not be established! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the next development of the world, Klein is unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His original plan is that although he only knows a little about everything, he can’t do things about invention and creation, but he knows everything and can foresee it. The direction of change and the trend of the times, such as the accumulation of salary, with the first barrel of gold, venture capital into the optimistic industry, and do not put the eggs in the same basket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein feels that as soon as possible, he will have a lot of wealth sooner or later, when he will find white gloves to be the agent on the bright side, and then establish The International Charity Fund, which provides relief to the poor, secretly funds the labor rebellion of all countries to play a game with the upper echelons of society to improve the lives of the people at the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he finds a way to return to Earth, he will split the property, one-third to Benson, and one-third to Melissa. One-third give it to its own foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, unfortunately, this wonderful vision of the future has been broken in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, fortunately, the world has electricity and magnetism, and there are telegram success stories. I will invest in this direction in the future..." Klein decided to fix the gods. The eyes move down line by line:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "December 21, don't think about oil, it's king to improve your sequence rating!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"December 22, the environment in the old town of Lishe is so dirty that it is unacceptable. If it wasn’t for me, I would never know. It also keeps what I saw when I was young. I want to recruit my ministers to develop a 'capital sewer and public toilet improvement plan'. Well, I have to correct the residents’ wrong habits, let them burn hot water, wash their hands frequently. Wash your face, don't litter, use your condom as much as possible, haha, I think how to name this thing, patriotic health campaign!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "So, the invention of the condom has to be put on the agenda, as well as masks and paper cups. Well, the original version is OK, give it a try, thank the world, it has a rubber tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"December 23, maybe I should Considering that suggestion, leave a path for yourself outside the church of the artisans, for example, to join the old, secret, and secret organization that affects the world situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Klein saw this and suddenly found that there was no more, and the mood was simply unspeakable: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Greater, the old, hidden, secret you said What is the name of the organization that affects the world situation? Is it something I don't know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can you stop here? How can you not write two more sentences? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is like reading a novel before, seeing the end, and discovering the author's eunuch..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"And, the Patriotic Health Campaign, the Emperor will also play..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The content of this page diary should After he became the governor of the Republic of Intis, he might call himself Caesar the Great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to go back and flip through the book and double the foreign country." Historical textbooks, see which year the Intis’ 'Capital Sewer and Public Toilet Improvement Program' appeared. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a dozen seconds, Klein converged his thoughts and let the diary in his hand disappear directly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Audrey sighed and adjusted her status to become an "audience". She smiled and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to know if the name of the sequence potion is 'arbitration' 'In addition, what kind of extraordinary person can directly pass through the wooden door, or invalidate the anti-lock?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This I know... the gram in the gray mist Ryan was waiting for the opening, but was robbed by the hangman:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need you to help me investigate one thing, as an exchange of answers."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Audrey was interested and asked with suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger looked at the fool, and said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to know if the king is interested Revenge in the Fossac Empire this year or before June next year, opening a new war on the east coast of Byron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current lingua franca of the Tarot Club It is the Lun language, which is based on the accent of the three parties at the first meeting. Therefore, Alger knows that Miss Justice is the nobleman of the Kingdom of Lun, and he also believes that Miss Justice knows that he is a Lun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the fool, Alger thinks that the Lun character he manifests is just a disguise that is easy to communicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- After the ritual magic, Alger unconsciously began to use "He" to honor the fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey recalls what he has seen in various social occasions during this time, and he has some confidence to nod:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, but it takes enough time to confirm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can wait." Alger smiled. "There is a witness to Mr. Fool, I believe that you will not confess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey looked at the silent and mysterious fool in the fog , sketching the corner: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I think the value of this matter is higher than the two questions I asked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you confirm the answer, I will make compensation according to the situation." Alger answered as early as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Justice, Mr. Hangman, do you need virtual currency to measure value? Klein leaned back and looked at the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey quietly breathed a sigh of relief and sang for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great! Audrey, you learn to make a counteroffer! She was so excited that she was out of the audience and quickly asked for something to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, sigh, Mr., did you receive the 1,000 pounds in cash? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I am still at sea, have not returned to the land." Alger is not willing to mention this matter, directly answering the previous question, "The extraordinary person who can pass through the wooden door and invalidate the anti-lock should be the sequence 9' apprentice. The secret organization knows that it has its formula, but does not rule out the possibility of obtaining it from another way, such as the ancient tomb of the Quaternary. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saga, the secret organization that has a thousand relationships with the witch sect... Klein leisurely rubbed his chin with his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Mr. Fool’s no rebuttal, Audrey couldn’t help but sigh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an 'apprentice' formula, maybe I won't choose 'audience'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s awesome! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger did not care about Miss Justice’s words and continued to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The name of the sequenced potion is similar to the 'arbitrator', I think you should be no stranger, because the order of the sequence that the Augustus family and the Castilla family of the Fenetport family have mastered is this. Of course, low-sequence formulas have been rewarded in ancient times, and some nobles may have ever been awarded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out that the beginning of Augustus was the 'arbitrator'..." Audrey felt awkward and felt that she had solved the puzzle that had been confused for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She silently sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder in front of them, I always want to obey the arrangement, Always not comfortable enough, always willing to admit defeat, always not like yourself! I thought it was my timidity...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The arbitrator has a convincing charm and sufficient authority, as well as an excellent fighting ability to deal with accidents." Alger succinctly describes the corresponding situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey slowly nodded, leaned back, and elegantly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger thought about it, looking sideways at the bronze long table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, I want to ask one thing, is the real creator's sanctuary that the Aurora will preach? Is it the legendary 'land of God'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandoned land? I have only seen this term once in Russell's diary... There may be some secret information in the night, but it is not part of what I can now contact... How do you answer me? Klein almost twitched his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He considered it for a few seconds, and his tone was plain and replied without a wave:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not you What you should know now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger is in a tight heart and immediately bows:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Please forgive me for being a little stunned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey was asked to ask what "the land of God abandoned", and the words also gave up this plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magnificent temple above the fog, silence and silence suddenly occupied the mainstream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Audrey always felt that she should say something like something:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Fool, if, I mean, if I have the opportunity to join other organizations, such as the psychological alchemy club, can I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein keeps leaning back Gesture, chuckle: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, my only requirement is not to reveal the existence of the Tarot Club."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you become a member of another organization, the materials and information you can exchange for will definitely improve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finish this sentence In other words, he suddenly thought that he was also a member of other organizations, and he was a real night-time person, and most of the people who fell down also had some relationship with the Church of the Storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does my Tarot be the so-called "Betrayal Alliance"? "Two-five party"? Klein fell into deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Audrey was so excited and excited, and immediately thought of a question, "Mr. Fool, if I found a gentleman who is suitable for the Tarot Club or Ms., can I guide them to join? How to guide?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger thought about it, followed by:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool, what are the criteria for the follow-up members of our party? How do you judge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is ideal, morality, culture, Discipline... Klein’s mind instantly popped up these four phrases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remained silent for a few seconds, and said after the justice and the slinger had a little uneasiness:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "If you feel comfortable, you can tell me here, let me decide whether to let him join. Before that, you can't have any suggestive behavior, which will lead to the secret leakage of Tarot. You have to remember Live, for non-party members..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
