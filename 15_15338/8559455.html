			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franke Lee is not aware of the abnormality of German Sparrow, and adds a sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just wanted to give you some help, throwing some seeds in the past, but unfortunately, I can't throw that far."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some seeds Go to the "Black Tulip"? This sea area has the breath of the "Goddess of the Earth", and the extraordinary things in the corresponding fields will change. The enemy and the enemy will not be separated, and at the same time attack... At the time, I was also on the "Black Tulip"... Fortunately, you did not throw... Klein Horan remembered the horror before the "Future" and remembered the watermelon that grew out on the top of the pirate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just had to think about the rhetoric and let the response meet the person of the German Sparrow, and suddenly saw the Heath Doyle in the shadow not far away. Come out, bend over and vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "bloodless" first retched, then softened his knees and reached the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vo! vomit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally spit out a yellow-green liquid with a half-corrosive gray-black piece of meat squirming in a slap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vo! vomit! vomit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heath Doyle spits out several similar things in a row<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See this scene, Klein felt relieved and relieved a lot. He was worried that Heath Doyle’s “Rose Bishop” would be polluted. “It seems that the other party should only be inclusive and not really digested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a crazy “Bishop of the Rose”... Klein silently sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s eyes are trying to remove from those vomits, and suddenly there are some thoughts in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Wreathing hunger" has been opened, must be "fed" once in a day, and there are no outsiders, no ideal villain... The pirate who died before can't, although his companions may not look at the body, But "squirming hunger" is to devour the soul...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if these meat pieces can serve as the next “food”, at least they belong to the vitality The body that was affected by the breath of the "Goddess of the Earth"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein went up two steps and walked to Heath Doyle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t bear to see the vomits of the beaches, and the line of sight instinctively cast on the other side, casting to the magnificent sea with the sun shining out of the ship <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he extended his left palm to the position of the gray and black meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The creepy hunger" did not change a bit, and did not split the mouth in the middle of the glove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that it doesn’t want to eat... It can only be used barely to deal with potential dangers. If you don’t find the right food in a day, just throw it away. Above the fog... Klein reluctantly retracted his hand and looked up at the direction of the captain's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "golden brooch in front of the star" will once again bloom and illuminate the "sun resentment", those who will vomit Heath Doyle The gray and black meat pieces are purified one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirate general’s face and expression have not changed, but it seems a bit tired, and the deep purple brilliance in his eyes has become more apparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that the vessel has re-launched, Klein will no longer stop and prepare to return to the room to replace the drenched clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson looked at him and leaned over and curiously opened his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up!" Klein spearheaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident caused him to lose the fisherman’s cuffs, so he’s more obsessed with someone who is riddled with misfortune, and the difference is defined as “peristalsis” Hungry" food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't pay any attention to him, entered the cabin and returned to his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the washroom, he took out a "water-making spell", read the ancient Hermes words, got a bathtub of water, and then took off all the clothes. Lying in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold feeling and the warm sunshine made him relax a lot, picked up the paper and pen that he had just brought from the desk, and wrote a divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The position of the fisherman's cuff."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seven times of meditation, Klein lie down completely. Sitting on the front of the bathtub, I entered the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray, intermittent, illusory world, he saw the deck and saw a living body with a few bodies rotted, azure fish sleeves The nail is embedded in the flesh of the left waist of the living body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the deck, it was dark and it made it completely impossible to see where the ship was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely lost on the "Black Tulip"... Klein opened his eyes and made a judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that 'Hell Admiral' don't find out, so that I can use this cuff to lock the position of the 'Black Tulip'...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s okay to find out, as long as Ludwell did not throw the sleeves away, and things were not separated for too long, I could position them, but the place of divination had to be changed from reality. To the fog...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, you have to be a divination interferer, prevent 'Hell Admiral' from positioning me with a cuff and even cursing me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His ring is really suspected of the legacy of the ancient death, um, write to tell Mr. Azke." Klein quickly cleaned his body, Get out of the bathtub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wipe clean, after replacing the former Ruen gentleman, Klein first adjusted the equipment, the laundry, then spread the letter, took out the Azick copper post. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing at the desk and looking at the things above, Klein’s right hand was slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flashed a few times, and put the Azick copper whistle away, put it in a small iron box, and cut off the breath with the "spiritual wall" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He prepared to leave the sea, left the "Future" and summoned the messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This loss is not small, but fortunately, I finally digested the 'no face' potion, can concentrate on waiting for the mermaid to appear...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm...the actual situation of this ruins of the gods is not quite the same as I expected. There is a breath of 'the earth goddess'...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is certainly not left behind, otherwise a god can't control its own breath.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second era The eight ancient gods do not have the authority to take charge of the realm of the earth.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are doubts in their affiliated gods, such as the queen," The harvest goddess 'Omega Bella, such as the goddess of life attached to the vampire ancestor Lilith...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a god war involving God, Or is it really not a matter of the Second Age? "Klein suffers from too little understanding of this ruins of the gods. He can only rely on speculation, and he wants to supplement it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He regains his mind and re-cuts the papermaker And filled with the changes and hidden symbols belonging to the "fool".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Klein raised the paper man and shook it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame was born out of thin air, burning the paper man into ashes.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, he has been able to get the desired effect initially. If he wants to be better, he must go to the fog to make a second response, using the "Black Emperor" card to shake the power of the mysterious space. Cooperate with “Paper Angels” to provide shelter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packing up the room, he wore "squirming hunger" and "fire" gloves, and slowly walked to the deck area, ready to carefully observe the surrounding environment, without letting go of any clues about the mermaid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just left the cabin and saw Anderson Hood sitting on the wooden casks, his face calm and restrained, like thinking and sentimental. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He really believes in keeping promises and drinking quietly? Klein groaned, passing in front of Anderson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson slowly raised his head and asked like a nightmare:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wine here, is it not? Is there a problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stunned and replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Anderson couldn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is too unlucky, the application of extraordinary ability has failed, so that he is not aware of the problem with wine? Klein moved his mouth and went forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the front deck, a lot of sailors are being surrounded, watching Nina acting as the priest of the "Story of the Storm", holding a brief for the pirates who just died. funeral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a little complicated prayer, Nina looked around:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reville The wish is to bury the mountain in the port of my hometown after death, where there is the most beautiful sunset.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He hopes to be cremated so that he will not be invaded after death. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The storm is on, may he sleep. "The sailors mostly believe in the "master of the storm", and they have right-hand boxing left chest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at this scene, Klein is not close, standing far Quietly watching.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the funeral was over, the pirate Revere’s body became ashes with the help of the reel, and Klein sighed and drew in his heart. The red moon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the sun is still bright, the sky is always noon, the "Future" bypasses several ruins and ruins, getting deeper and deeper This ocean.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson did not know when it was back to normal, and came to Klein.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He glanced at the building complex that was submerged under water:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through this ruin, turn left for about ten nautical miles and have a chance I met the mermaid. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually... Klein is about to respond, the sky is suddenly dark, the sun is disappearing steeply.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Another night is coming.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more to say, he returned to the room and lay down on the bed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon, he was awake in his dreams, with clean floor-to-ceiling windows, neatly arranged long tables and bookshelves filled with books.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, He returned to the place where he left the dream before and returned to the library.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the evening came in, and all things were covered with a layer of light gold, gram Ryan moved slightly in confusion, and walked to the shelf that was last viewed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, he saw the occults such as "The Book of the Curse" Classics.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just planned to take out the book, quickly flip through it, his eyes suddenly swept to the opposite bookshelf and swept a black cover book:<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosser Notes 3!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Diary of the Emperor? The whole diary? Klein will subconsciously reach out.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
