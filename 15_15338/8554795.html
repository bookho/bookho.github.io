He has a paper pen and wrote a divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Its source."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the pen and prepare for the crit, Klein stares at the paper and the biotoxin bottle, leaning back on the chair Back, meditation while meditating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he entered a gray dream and saw a dim but spacious room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are animals such as King Cobra, Black Widow Spider, etc. in the room, with many strange plants, messy and sultry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A serious middle-aged man in a white coat stood in front of the longest table at the center, throwing the snake gall, the spider venom and other things into the same Hanging in the black iron pot on the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, he even put in a few items with strong spiritual brilliance, such as, sometimes, black gas, sometimes condensed into the lungs of the dark green body Things, for example, a tube of clear blue liquid, such as red eyes...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air around the black iron pan gradually becomes sticky, they go to the most The central government gathered, but it was constantly pushed away, which is difficult to achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man with a white coat saw this scene, his brows slowly wrinkled, and his expression was a little anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flipped over the black notebook next to it, biting his teeth and cutting his wrist with a ritual silver plaque. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A drop of bright blood then falls into the black iron pot, which seems to have a life, suddenly bursting out of the horrible suction, the surrounding sticky air Sucked in and sucked in all the reds that had not completely left the wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not over yet, no matter how the middle-aged man in white coat struggles to resist, how to expose his fear, he can’t contain it, he can’t help himself. The iron pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body was stretched, his head was compressed, and he was eaten a little by the iron pot in the screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specimens hanging around, the plants that are placed, all the things that can move and move, all fly into the iron pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown mist is filled in the room, quietly flowing and swaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the day, the entire room has become empty, leaving only the brown translucent vial lying quietly on the central open space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene fades quickly, the dreams are breaking fast, Klein opens his eyes, silent Self-speaking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original biotoxin bottle is a product of a dead experiment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I thought it was the extraordinary characteristics left by the runaways... In that case, the divination formula can be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Klein, the extraordinary person who is out of control The characteristics and the extraordinary characteristics of being polluted by evil spirits can be used as divination formulas, just like the "All Black Eyes" left by the former "Master of Secrets" Rosago. This is because he has a gray fog connection. This mysterious space eliminates the negative effects and has a rich life.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, seals formed directly from similar extraordinary characteristics can also be used for divination Medicine formula.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but if they are only used as the main material, they are made by craftsmen and other extraordinary people or some dangerous experiments. It becomes magical items that Klein current level of divination can not do anything, even if there are enhancements over the fog this mysterious space, nor <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens, the luxury villa of Earl of Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey continues to learn psychology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside her feet, the golden-haired big dog Su Shi is there, his eyes are stunned, and it will shake his tail from time to time, seemingly very enjoyable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychologist Esrand finished the introductory part and pretended to mention it inadvertently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, there is such a theory.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It believes that human beings will inherit certain consciousness from the ancestors and from the past generations, thus forming their own behavior. The underlying logic of the pattern, for example, many people have never seen a viper, but as long as they encounter it, they will instinctively feel afraid and want to avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is this? This is what we inherited from the first generation of human beings, hiding in the deepest sense of consciousness. In the old age, people continued to fight with snakes, and All kinds of fierce animal wrestling, gradually inscribed this memory in the consciousness, inherited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is that inherited?" Lippi asked with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Island, long hair and waist, laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a very good The problem. Some people’s explanation is that everyone’s consciousness is connected at the bottom, is one, and the traces left behind here and Features will affect the consciousness of being alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, the lowest level of consciousness is like an innocent sea. The unique consciousness of each of us is an island on the sea, which can be divided into Two parts, hidden under the water, more and more subconscious, exposed to the surface of the sea, can usually be perceived by the surface consciousness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is this Part of the theoretical foundation of the psychology school. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey looked at Su Shi and touched the golden hair of his neck:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "So, can we use the sea that connects each other to influence the consciousness of others and achieve the goal of treating certain mental illnesses?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the mysterious foundation and extraordinary ability of the "psychologist"? But it seems that it is not enough, and something is worse, for example, the sky above the head, Covering all the sky? Audrey is ignorant and curious to think.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are very talented in this regard! "Island surprises," but we can only influence the surrounding waters, and then influence the people who are close to it. If you rush deep into the voyage, it is easy to lose yourself. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up at the gorgeous wall clock on the wall and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Time is up, today's class is over, Miss Audrey, if you are interested in the psychology of this genre, we will continue to talk next time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. "Audrey got up and saluted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of sending the other party away, she nodded thoughtfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Islant is not like a real “psychologist”, at most like me, she is a “reader”...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She What I just talked about is the theoretical basis of the psychological alchemy association?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are really suffocating, why not develop me into the conference...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ao Lili thoughts, and Su Shi said happily next to him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Audrey, I feel her and We are the same people, no, the same dog, no, not right... Wang! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Su, who is initially mastering human language, is in chaos and cannot find accurate words to describe his feelings.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The southern part of the bridge, the rose flower street, outside the harvest church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who was doing normal dressing, looked up at the sacred emblem of the outer wall, took a cane, climbed the steps, and passed the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing he has to do is to confirm the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to perform better is to subtly save the vampire Emlin White, without suspicion, and then provide clues The identity of the detective, accepting the thanks of the White family, and getting the audience’s applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be an interesting performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harvest church is not big, there is only one prayer hall, Klein found an aisle seat, took off his hat and looked forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Utrechtsky bishop is preaching, the height of more than two meters and twenty and the burly body that the loose priest's robes can't cover, gives a great sense of oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his expression is unusually gentle, with praise and gratitude for life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No such daring in front of such "Fathers", so few believers listened quietly, from time to time to make the Mother Earth Church unique Prayer gestures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein observed carefully, waiting patiently, not arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the end of the sermon, he held his cane and prepared to get up for follow-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the door leading to the back room of the church came in with a man wearing a priest's robe of the Mother Earth Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is twenty-eight-year-old, black and red, high nose, thin lips, handsome but not masculine, it is Emlin White. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s mouth opened a little, almost impossible to close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shouldn’t this guy be locked up in the basement? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not always yelling to uphold his beliefs, and never obey the idea of ​​Bishop Utravovsky? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White distributed the things about the Eucharist to a believer and finally stopped in front of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thoughts sharply, immediately depressing the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are Emlin. White? Your parents entrust my friend to find you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you are here? Did you encounter something? Do you need help? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin. White has disappeared from the characteristic pride, revealing a smile that is better than crying:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I will be able to go home soon. "[< /> /> </ br> nbsp; Believers, no, priests. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer is completely out of Klein's expectation, so that he did not know how to respond at the moment, can only scream in his mind:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, last time in the harvest church, you are very determined to admire the moon, and will never change to the goddess of the earth. How long will it take you to give in? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This speed is too fast?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your persistence? What about your exercise? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My well-prepared performance has been forced to end without a start...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, this does not play cards according to common sense! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
