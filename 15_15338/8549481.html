			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒,哒,哒. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps echoed in the narrow, narrow corridor, spreading far and wide in the silence, no noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s back was straight, and he didn’t go slowly with the middle-aged pastor. He didn’t ask questions, didn’t chat, and was like a windless lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the guarded passage, the middle-aged priest opened a secret door with a key and pointed to the downward stone steps:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The crossroads to the left is the Chanis Gate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May Goddess bless you." Klein points to his chest. Four times, outline the "shape" of the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world uses secular etiquette, religion uses religious rituals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the beautiful god." The middle-aged pastor returned with the same action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein no longer speaks, along the stone steps, with the elegant gas lamps inlaid on the walls on both sides, step by step into the darkness. Halfway through, he subconsciously turned back and saw that the middle-aged pastor was still standing at the door, standing at the top of the ladder, standing in the shadow of the gas light. It looks like a wax figure that doesn't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein retracted his gaze and continued to move. Not long after, he touched the ground with icy slabs and went to the crossroads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not turn to the direction of "Chanis Gate", because Dunn Smith, who had just passed the round, certainly would not be there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the familiar road on the right, Klein re-entered another step and appeared inside the "Black Thorough Security Company." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the door or closing or half-covering, he did not look recklessly, but entered the reception hall and saw the sweet-haired brown-haired girl concentrated on reading a magazine. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Rosanne." Klein came to the side and deliberately tapped the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roshan ran up, knocked over the chair and said in a hurry:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, today The weather is good, you, you, Klein, how come you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She caressed her chest and gasped for two breaths, just like being afraid of being caught by her father Lazy little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have something to find the captain." Klein replied briefly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... scared me, I thought the captain came out." Roshan glanced at Klein. "I don't know how to knock!" Hey, you Fortunately, I am a generous and kind lady. Hey, I prefer the word girl... What is your job with the captain? He is in the room opposite Mrs. Oliana."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the spirit is quite tight, Klein is amused by Roshan, and he sinks a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"secret. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Rosanne’s eyes were round and unbelievable. At the same time, Klein was slightly embarrassed and quickly said goodbye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He re-opened the door of the first office of his right hand through the partition door of the reception room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please come in." Dunn Smith's low and gentle voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pushes the door, backhands close, take off the hat ceremony:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, Mr. Captain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, is there anything?" Dunn's black trench coat and hat are hanging on the next coat rack, exposed. The body only wears a white shirt and a black vest. Even if the hairline is high, the gray eyes are deep and refreshing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunn leaned back, his hands clasped, and the dark ash was quietly looking at Klein's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t pick up the topic, but instead asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Have you come from the church?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Klein definitely answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng nodded slightly, did not say good or bad, turned back to the topic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Welch’s father who did not believe in the cause of our report, and asked private investigators to investigate from Windy City.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Conston in Kamihain is also known as Wind City is an extremely developed area of ​​the coal and steel industry, and can rank among the top three in all cities of the Kingdom of Lun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t wait for Klein to comment, Dunn continues: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“may also come from that The source of the notes, oh, we are getting the Antigonus family notes from where Chavech got. Of course, it is impossible to exclude other individuals or organizations that are pursuing this note."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" Klein asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, he hopes to be the first reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng didn’t answer immediately, took a cup of coffee and took a sip, and the ash didn’t see a trace: #br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Return according to the previous road, and then do whatever you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any?" Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any." Dunn must nod. "Of course, don't scare away each other, and don't violate the law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein took a breath, turned away, left the room and returned to the basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned left at the crossroads, bathed in the gas lights on both sides, quietly walking in the empty, dark, cold passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒哒Echo echo stacking, the more lonely, the more fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Klein approached the ladder, step by step, and saw the middle-aged pastor standing in the shadow and standing at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no opening between the two, and the middle-aged pastor turned silent and let the road open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way silently, Klein returned to the Great Prayer Hall, the light and purity of the round holes after the arched platform, the darkness and tranquility in the room remained. The Mr. and the ladies who confessed to the outdoor queue are still the same, but they have become a lot less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Klein took a cane and a newspaper, and as if nothing had happened, he slowly left the big prayer hall and left the holy race. Lena Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as soon as he went out and saw the raging sun, he suddenly had a familiar feeling of being watched, only to feel like a prey pegged by an eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, a doubt emerged in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the "Peeper" Why don't you follow me into the church? Even then, I can still use his dark environment and the help of the pastor to pass him through the short-term "disappearance", but is it difficult to pretend to pray and follow the monitoring? Nothing to do bad things, is there any problem with going straight? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless he has a black history, is afraid of the church, fears the bishop, knows that the other person may have extraordinary ability...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;so it seems that the possibility of private detectives is very low and low...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call! Klein breathed a sigh of relief, no longer as tight as before, taking a leisurely walk and winding to the back of Zouteland Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped in front of an old-fashioned, wall-drenched building with a house number "3" and the name "Zotelan Shooting Club". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein just entered, the feeling of being peeped disappeared immediately. He seized the opportunity and gave the badge of the "Special Operations Department" to the waiter in charge of reception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly verified, he was introduced underground and came to a closed small shooting range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"10m target." Klein simply replied to the waiter, took the revolver from the arm of the armpit, and took it out of the pocket. Box of brass colored bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly being stared at, letting his desire for self-protection overcome the procrastination, so he can’t wait to practice the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the waiter left, he took out the runner and quit the silver hunting demon bullets, then picked up the normal bullets of brass color, one hair The hair is stuffed into the bomb nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he didn’t leave the vacancy to prevent accidental shots, did not take off his formal jacket, took off the half-high hat, and practiced in the most common dress. After all, it is impossible to meet the enemy and encounter danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed the runner and slipped with his thumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he held the gun in both hands and jerked up straight, aiming at the target 10 meters away. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was not in a hurry to shoot, but seriously recalled the military training off-target experience and common sense such as three points and one line, shooting and recoil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗! Oh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sound of the clothes, Klein practiced aiming over and over again, practicing holding the position, seriously like a child in the college entrance examination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many times, he retreated to the wall, sat down on the soft bench, put the left wheel aside, and massaged his arm. Rested for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes to think about it, Klein picked up the pistol of the wooden grip and the copper runner again and went to the shooting position to make a standard posture. , triggered the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shakes his arm, his body leans back slightly, and the bullet deviates from the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who took the experience and shot it in one shot, groping in the practice until the six bullets were all shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting on the target... Klein stepped back and sat down, taking a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! He took out the wheel and let the six shells fall to the ground, and then continued to insert the remaining brass color bullets into one piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The event relaxed the lower arm, and Klein stood up again and summed it back to the shooting position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshots reverberated, the target swayed, and Klein practiced again and again, resting again and again, and will receive 30 normal bullets and all the remaining five rounds. Light, gradually stabilize the target, and began to pursue the number of rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sore arm, he poured out the last five shells, lowered his head, and stuffed the silver hunting demon bullets with complex patterns one by one. Into, and reserved a false hit. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the left wheel was placed under the gun bag, Klein patted the smoke and dust on his body, and with a relaxed, walked out of the special shooting range and returned to the street. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of being looked at once again, Klein’s mood was calmer than before, he walked slowly to Champagne Street and spent 4 pence on a rail public carriage returning I took the Iron Cross Street and entered the apartment where I lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
