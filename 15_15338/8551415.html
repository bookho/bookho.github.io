			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The source of this golden liquid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After meditation seven times of divination, Klein Holding a parchment, holding the virtual golden liquid, leaning back against the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not know whether it is possible to carry out divination by relying solely on the feeling that the items that are present are separated, and can only be boldly assumed and carefully verified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a few seconds, Klein’s eyes turned deep, from brown to black, into a state of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyelids hang down and "see" to see the illusory and awkward dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray and shattered world, suddenly a golden, dazzling sun jumped out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A low snoring came through countless voids, and the pure, clear light instantly ignited everything, and the golden and burning flames screamed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein got out of the dream, trembled and turned to the side, the body has turned into a torch, burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, his thoughts are completely frenzied, and no normal thoughts emerge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious space above the fog is violently shaken, the magnificent palace collapses, and the old and mottled bronze long table is thrown out of the hole. It became a few paragraphs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This terrible change lasted only three seconds, and the silence was restored above the fog, as if nothing had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden flame of Klein was gradually extinguished, and his face rolled black and screamed until the ability to think returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He supported the armrests of the high back chair, and stood up hard, and was frightened and stunned by the encounter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that, he never thought that just one divination would bring such consequences! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a few breaths and looked up and found that the palace and the ancient long table that had never changed were destroyed. This is nothing unusual. Above the fog, it is almost unprecedented damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on here? Is my divination pointing to an incredible existence?" Klein recovered a little while letting the body burnt I fell off and guessed things. "If there is no mysterious space above the fog, I am afraid that there is no more gray. Is it that the golden liquid is blood? I just saw it." Eternal Liyang, or the powerful angel of His Majesty? No, it is a sun, I feel more like the former... I am going, do I look directly at the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wants to be more afraid, and feels that he is almost completely confessed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s ignorant, fearless, don’t die without death... ...I can't take anything for divination in the future, who knows what to see!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you come again, I really don't know if this mysterious space can still be Help me block the most deadly injuries... I will die when I get there..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, if you try to continue with the golden liquid, it will definitely not work. The existence of the suspected 'eternal yang' is just affected by the mystery, surprise and sudden influence of the divination on the fog. I have not had time to make more reactions... If He is prepared, this mysterious space may not be able to stop..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein’s figure returned to normal, no longer black, but Compared to before, the gloom is a bit illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and rubbed his temple, giving the idea of ​​restoring the palace and the long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palace of the giant residence and the long table made of bronze instantly recovered, and everything returned to the way it was before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat down, leaning against the back of the chair, laughing and laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not entirely a bad thing. At least I figured out where the limits of this mysterious space are. I have a certain goal... Can an angel close to the gods fully shake the power above the fog?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, my 'Divinity Code' must add another piece of content: 'Do not arbitrarily divination may involve high-level creatures.' Well, don't mess Lingshi, if you look directly at something that shouldn't be directly looked at, maybe it's on the spot Game Over, there is no such mysterious space in the outside world to resist most of the bad influences..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, Klein’s expression suddenly became weird, because his mind was echoing some knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, knowledge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short moment of contact with the existence of the suspected "eternal glory", Klein has always been in divination, so he instinctively divined from the other side. Something and knowledge came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly used the technique of "dream divination" to recall and sort out the harvest that was not in the original purpose, pick up the black round pen with the present, write one by one道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1. Do not look directly at God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2. Pure daytime. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"3. 'Japanese inflammation spell' production skills... This is a relatively advanced solar field spell, the effect can last for a year to decay... can Instead of holding a ceremony, pray to 'Eternal Vigorous Sun' instead of using the seal '3—0782' to steal power from this mutated Sun Emblem...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"4. Very hostile to the Lord of the Storm, the god of knowledge and wisdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"5. 'Singer' potion formula: main material , crystal sun flower or the tail feather of an adult flint bird or the tail feather of a flamingo... a stone of the sea monster or a song of a sunflower... auxiliary material, a midsummer grass, five drops of July wine juice, fine Dark leaves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"6. 'Prayer' potion formula: main material, a piece of gemstone or powder of blazing soul or mirror The blood of the cockroach or the heart of the smashing monster... auxiliary materials, one flower of Phnom Penh, three drops of aconite juice..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"7. The priest's potion formula: lack of main material, auxiliary materials, 5 grams of rosemary, 7 drops of citrus juice, rock water..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"8. Sequence 4 'no darkness' potion formula, the main material can be extracted from the golden god blood extracted from the Sun's emblem, in addition to the use of the three tail feathers of the adult sun god bird and the sacred gemstone, the auxiliary material is missing..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After writing the above eight, Klein couldn’t help but knock the edge of the bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This harvest is much more than he imagined! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, it’s enough to survive the ruined divination, who knows that there is this extra “survival reward” . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the insider’s internal data, he knows that the sequence path mastered by the “Eternal Vigor” church is called “the sun”, and the sequence 9 is the “singer”. A "professional" that brings courage and strength to the self and the companion with sings, and their slogan is: "Let us praise the sun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The corresponding sequence 8 is "Prayer", which can perform some spells and rituals in the solar field, and is very restrained of dead bodies and ghosts. Sequence 7 is called "Sun God Official", and the spells and sacrificial abilities in this field are all Greatly improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, I got the complete potion recipe for the 'Sun' route sequence 9 and sequence 8, um, unlike the previous ones, this time the magic The drug formula also lists alternatives or material names from different periods... It is a formula that is divined directly from the 'eternal glory'!” Klein thought with relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the request of the teenager of the Silver City, his original plan was to see if the "downside down" could be solved, after all, the Church of the Storm and the Eternal Sun The church is the oldest orthodox sect, and sometimes it has been thousands of years of cooperation and confrontation. The initial sequence of the "sun" route in the former is simply normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upside down" may not pay attention to this aspect before, did not apply for access to the corresponding information, but he is likely to be the sequence 7 "voyager "I'm really going to get it, it's still relatively simple. However, I don't need him now, I solved it myself, and solved it in an unbelievable and extremely dangerous way... Miss Justice, Mr. Hangman, Sun Classmates, your fools almost turned into cokes... Klein still has a bit of fear in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
