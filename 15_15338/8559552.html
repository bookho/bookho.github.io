			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is missing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A darkness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of sudden changes, Dairik’s first reaction was not to panic, but to clasp his hands and reach his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clear light of the road swayed from him, dispelling the deep darkness around him and illuminating every corner of the basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the environment where Dairik lives, the night is the most terrible existence. Once they leave the Silver City, they must keep their light shining, even if they are short-lived. The interval should not exceed five seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick first entered the exploration team. When there was no experience, he almost made a mistake and ruined himself. Fortunately, he stood "master" not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light swayed slowly and continually, and Derick raised the right hand clasping the "Hurricane Axe" and carefully looked around. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that except for Heinham and Joshua, the two teammates who had already followed their own basement disappeared, the slate and the big beach on the wall I don’t know when the black traces have become blood red, and the wet dripping seems to have been splashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Delic, who is familiar with the exploration of the textbook and calms down, can not help but think of a possibility, that is, not Joshua and Heinm, and It is himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just approached the altar and silently read the three names... Normally, even an angel must have an accurate name in full format. In order to receive the "prayer" that others have caused by mourning or copying, and it is said that there are limits of scope... I don’t know if the kings of angels must also be like this...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Hey, one of these three names is the key to unlocking the power of the altar. I use the meditation of the giant language that can shake the nature and cause the problem to be triggered. No, this is not right, it must be effective to read the exit, even if this is the real name of the king of angels, there has been no problem before..." Dairik was puzzled and turned a little uneasy and turned back to the altar Next, I went back to the stone table.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly saw the words and symbols on the stone table clearer and more complete than before, just like the ceremony host The same is done.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words are divided into three types, one is the giant language, the other is the dragon language, and the other is that Dairik does not know However, he suspects that he is the "inverted man" and the "just" lady in the mouth of the ancient Hermes, because during this time the Tarot exchange, he has some initial grasp of the words, this with the stone table The text is quite close.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the giant language and the dragon language is very consistent, they are repeating the three names and the corresponding title:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Destiny Angel", Ulous;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red "," Medici; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dark Angel", Sasley.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The title and name are a phrase that Dairik is familiar with:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Redemption Rose"!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Sasliel is really the king of angels, called "the dark angel", He and the "destination angel", "red angel" is the founder of "redemption rose"? Do not know the "fool" Mr. to him What do you know... He must know very well... The ancient Hermes should have the same meaning... In the afternoon town that has converted to "the Lord who created everything", there are three angels who are secretly worshipping the Lord. ...Thinking of it, Dairik suddenly has a cold back and feels that he seems to have touched the edge of the truth that the Creator abandoned the land.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up again, only Seeing the blood on the wall is still red, Heinham and Joshua still have no trace.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again meditation has no effect, also This did not play a role in itself... Dairik took a breath and carried the "Hurricane Axe" and cautiously went to the basement entrance, hoping to find the source of the problem and confirm which side was out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One step, two steps, three steps, he seems to be a giant candle, moved back to the upper hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows here are thick, gray and quiet, and the rotten chairs and the remaining stone tables are silently placed, no different from before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dairik still did not find Joshua and Heinham, but had to go to the window with a high degree of tension to see if he could meet other members of the exploration team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, hehe... In the slight footsteps, he was close to the big hole that should have been in the sash, leaning forward and looking out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless gray buildings are compact, high or low, stepped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequency of lightning in the air is very low. Many windows are lit up with a little candlelight, and they are dizzy and swaying for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...Derick couldn’t help but swallow the saliva. There was a kind of afternoon that the town never experienced a great change. The residents here still feel calm and live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinham carrying a animal lantern does not need to bend over to pass At the entrance to the basement, the Joshua Road next to it is funny:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This house must belong to humans, but their family must have the blood of the 'giant', height It should be similar to me. Hey, the ruin city we went to last time, we have to bow to the door!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "giant" blood does not mean certain There is a giant's lineage, but it represents the physical characteristics of the potions produced by this route and passed on to the offspring. Tall is one of the main manifestations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua looked up at Heinham and snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is You, I don't need it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you won't be able to advance for a long time, and by then, it won't be much shorter than me." Heinham laughs. Say it, and use the corners of his eyes to watch Dairik near the altar to prevent accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua thought for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I am very surprised, the chief is sequence 4 The 'hunting demon' should be like a giant, three or four meters high. Why does it look normal and half a head higher than me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Heinme subconsciously rounds the circle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The chief is said to have a giant form."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Giant form? After becoming a giant, will his clothes be torn apart?" Joshua asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless his clothes and trousers are magical items." Heimham and Joshua smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are about to share this joke with Dairik, but after turning around, they find that the boy is gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick, who should have been in front of the altar, is gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinim and Joshua’s expressions become dignified, a straight, wide and big straight sword, a left palm with a red glove . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They carefully approached the altar and examined it carefully, without any suspicious traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua is trying to identify the remaining words on the stone table, but Heinham took a slap in the shoulder:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't look, I think about it, before Dairik disappeared, I was looking at the text above.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We went looking for the 'Chief 'come. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. Joshua nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not panic and hurriedly left, and after looking around again, the middle finger of his thumb ignited the rest of the altar. The candle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will protect Dairik from the real darkness!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;——The Discovery Team of Silver City has had similar experiences in the ruins of those city-states. One of the players seems to have disappeared suddenly. It is actually hidden by some kind of power and still in place, but his teammates are eager to seek help. I hurriedly took the lantern and left the area, so the poor guy was swallowed up by the real darkness and could no longer be found. If no player later fell into the same situation, he was lucky to be rescued on the spot, others would not even Know the exact "death cause" of the former.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candle lit up and the dim light shone around, and Heinham and Joshua left, coming to the lane, releasing the spiritual signal that everyone carried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t wait too long, Colin Iliad jumped from the top of the other house and landed steadily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" asked the "hunter". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver straight sword in his hand has been coated with a layer of light gray ointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinim immediately stated the matter just briefly, and ended up: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We I couldn’t find out why Dairik disappeared.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”Dyrick...” Colin thought thoughtfully, crossed the two, and walked first. I entered the corresponding house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a little candle outside, dim and warm, but Dairik seems to fall Into the so-called ice cave, the coldness of my heart can not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tightened the right hand of the "Hurricane Axe", took back the look of the town, turned and walked into the basement, and stood in front of the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has basically been affirmed that the problem is himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not explore the impulse of this strange afternoon town, and even dared not open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek is not too nervous, nor obvious flustered, because he does not think he is suffering a serious problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as it is not a direct danger, it is not serious... Dairik took a breath and buried his head, whispering whisper:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fool who does not belong to this era;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mysterious ruler above the fog;<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king of yellow and black who is in good luck..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein who is watching the scenery of the ruins of the gods by the window Have to enter the bathroom again, set up the interference items, and go back four steps to the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat down to the top of the bronze long table, extended his right hand, spread out the spirituality, touched the group of deep red that symbolizes the small "sun" Stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, the voice of prayer became very clear, and the corresponding picture appeared in front of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first saw a small "sun" that was still somewhat vague, and then found that his environment was a bit wrong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "sun" is surrounded by indescribable darkness, and there is a differently shaped eye in the darkness watching him silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These eyes are dense, faint, dark and introverted, like uninvited onlookers, and the little "sun" is unaware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the afternoon is so dangerous? Klein knows very well about what the "Sun" classmates have to do recently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it and intuitively thought that the darkness was very strange and not real enough, so he gave up the option of responding to the little "sun" with the "Poseidon Scepter". To pull the opponent into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s spirituality shows that the deep red star seems to be in a swamp, making it difficult to pull people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is the king of angels? Klein's thoughts turned, letting the fog and the mysterious space below sway and pass it over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the promotion sequence 5, without relying on the "Black Emperor" card, without the help of the corresponding ceremony, he can slightly shake the power above the fog! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uninterrupted, Klein easily completed the pull, and the "Sun" Dairik figure appeared on the high back chair belonging to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Klein vaguely saw the strange darkness of the flowing around the small "sun" body broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
