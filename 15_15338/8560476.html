			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resentful Seignor, under the control of Klein, penetrated thick earth and stones, came to Sharon’s side and saw the front buried A broken armrest engraved with an asymmetrical pattern, which is similar to the previously found broken wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This handrail is not purely dark, and the lines are dark red, like the interweaving of iron and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the picture of the nightmare of the past, Klein determined that this was not the high-back chair that the young man suspected of Medici was sitting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seal has at least two high-back chairs in the room! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Klein" and Sharon did not speak, circling in different directions, looking for additional traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, they found the proof of the existence of the third high back chair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a chair, deep red, pure black, and the two pieces of wood are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the problem caused by the asymmetry of the Quaternary..." Klein knew Sharon’s style, took the initiative to speak, and said that he did not believe it. Discourse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——In the nightmare caused by the evil spirits, the high back chairs appear at least in color! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon shakes his head very small:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Three' is more ceremonial "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She refers to the "blood emperor" Arista. Tudor wants to kill the innocent, there will be only one, the room that sealed the evil spirits may have There was a ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein heard a stunned look, and his face flashed a picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a spacious and dimly lit room, three different styles of high back chairs are placed in a center, and each chair has a low head. A humanoid creature with a lingering atmosphere, including the "Red Angel" Medici. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene is getting clearer and clearer, and Klein instantly thinks of two other things:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main material of the potion of the sequence "Black Emperor" is "uniqueness" and two extraordinary characteristics of the sequence 1 (excluding the one owned by itself);<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The blood emperor, Arista Tutu, seems to have forcibly jumped from the sequence of the "Black Emperor" route 1 "The Prince of the Order" to the sequence 0 "Red Priest" of the non-similar path, becoming a true god of semi-madness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the thoughts turning, Klein quickly guessed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room has been held once Field promotion sequence 0, involving the ritual of the true god level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, according to the complex rituals required by the "Black Emperor", this should be only the potion part. The way of representing "war" obviously requires chaos and disputes across the continent. Come to match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "Blood Emperor" Alista Tutu does not have the corresponding sequence 1 extraordinary characteristics, so his "Red Priest" potion needs Three sequence 1 angels or seals to provide extraordinary features, here are three high back chairs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right, the evil spirit of the suspected "red angel" Medici said that the way to get rid of the seal is to find Sauron, Einhorn and The direct descendants of the Medici family, each taking 10 ml of blood, mixed with holy water... Sauron and Einhorn are angel families who control the "hunter", the "red priest" extraordinary way, from the Quaternary Surviving to the present, one has been declining, can only control the spy agency of Intis and a faction of the military, one is still the royal family of Fossac... Klein thoughts flashed, what happened in this room, to the evil spirits Real identity, and new judgments:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two high back chairs are seated by the ancestors of the Sauron and Einhorn families. 1 angel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great probability of the evil spirit is not simply the "red angel" Medici, but also the remnant spirit and hatred of the ancestors of the Sauron and Einhorn family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, here was the "sacrificial" of the three sequence 1 angels! The curse of their dying before death and the legacy of the ritual itself made this room extremely horrible and sealed? Fortunately, I reported it to the church in advance and asked them to deal with it. Otherwise, it was only on my own. Even though I and Miss Sharon had already promoted the sequence 4, I might die here and become the food of the evil spirit... Klein for a while. I am afraid for a while. At the same time, he became more and more aware of the reason why the "Red Priest" card fell into the evil spirit, when all the high-level avenues were buried in the same way. After this underground relic, the attraction between the extraordinary features will naturally lead the holder over without any deviation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the Emperor said that where the separation will be aggregated, all the aggregates will be separated, when the "blood emperor" Alista Tutu is behind, he is The true nature of possession, that is, the characteristics of sequence 0, should also be divided into four parts...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One attribute to abstraction and concept is “uniqueness” The next is the extraordinary characteristics of the three sequences. If this is not the case, when someone becomes a god, there will be no sequence 1 in the corresponding extraordinary way...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp One or two of these extraordinary characteristics of the sequence 1 will be also towed into the sealed room? This should also be one of the reasons why the "Big Card" was attracted! Klein thinks more and more that he feels that he has despised the evil spirit before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an angel who was promoted by the “conspirators”...Klein, who stands under the tree, manipulates Seignor to open:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it’s a ritual.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things related to the 'Blood Emperor' Alista. Very high. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon listened quietly and added one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sauron, Einho Well, Medici..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Sharon also suspected from the details of the evil spirits that the three high-back chairs in this room used to belong to different Angel... Klein thought about it and took the initiative to use the mouth of Seignor to reveal: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The Blood Emperor' Alista. The true god of the 'hunter' route, the representative of the card is the 'red priest'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon silent for a few seconds, seems to understand something, and instead said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The card is gone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the "Red Priest" card that the evil spirits have shown.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe The evil spirit has long been out of trouble, before the 'Night of the Night' and 'Mechanical Heart' destroyed the place. "Klein said his guess," and it took away all the extraordinary features and the 'Red Priest' card. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon silently looked around for half a circle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is very cunning, it won't Leave such obvious clues. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the extraordinary character outside the seal house is obviously not in the sequence 4, and there is no attraction for a evil spirit that used to be the king of angels. The same is true of the "Red Priest" card... It can be understood by taking away the things in the room. Why is it that even a little residue is not left? It is like saying to others, "Haha, I lied to you, I have succeeded in getting out of trouble, I have the ability." Come and hunt me..." Wait, maybe this is what it wants to say! Klein thought about it, and suddenly letting Senio open:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, blackmail does not mean leaving no clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sequence of the 'hunter' route is called 'provocative'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, The "red angel" that appeared in his mind was photographed with Anderson Hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon did not listen to the movement, his mouth was slightly open, but he did not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, the red-haired Elaine is not like the people of the Sauron family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she is very talented in provoking the "sickness of the disease"... Well, when the members of the Sauron family were too angry, the emperor was half dead... Klein breathed a sigh of relief and groaned a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of silence was quickly broken by Klein, and his singer Senegal glanced around and made a joke:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe this is why they were caught here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is helping Arista. Sharon asked transparently and imaginatively, but did not seem to expect an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the Six Gods..." "Kline" remembered the six statues in the outer hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he soon became shaken:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, the Seven Gods support The Truncost Empire, Sauron and Einhorn are the great aristocrats of this empire.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, it is not excluded to support the map first, because He is mad and breaks. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the Six Gods, does it mean that there are still gods supporting Alista. Who is it? Klein silently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon did not stop, floated on the ground, floated to the ground, and returned to the big tree.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Klein took away Senegal’s resentment and let it enter the gold coin of the iron cigarette case, and then asked casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has always been very curious, and it does not possess the pure evil spirits and resentment of extraordinary characteristics. Where does the power come from? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Spiritual World. Sharon simply replied.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary characteristics are conserved, but the source of extraordinary power is not necessarily? Well, maybe the spiritual world itself is the product of some extraordinary characteristics... ... Klein nodded and looked at the dirt road at the bottom of his eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will continue to investigate the whereabouts of the evil spirits, and if there is a harvest, I will inform you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intends to go back and ask "Magic Mirror" Arrods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking here He took out the pen and the note, took the brush and wrote the method of calling his messenger, and then handed it over:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you have anything, you can write me a letter. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon took the paper and carefully looked at both eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am brave Bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Writing a letter can be sent to 126 Gard Street, Hillston, and the recipient is Marie Asia Pacific."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein took the pen into his pocket and used the ritual silver to create a spiritual wall in the face of Sharon, re-sealing the iron cigarette case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he was very gentlemanly to go to another street to stop a rental carriage, all the way back to the Bakerland Bridge area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, he returned to his high-end hotel in the Hillston area, changing his way and changing to a carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byyam, seaweed bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi drifting for a while at the sea once again set foot in the "generous city", ready to help the rebels coordinate some affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled the cap down and sat down at the corner of the bar, ready to listen to the recent rumors, so that the information was not timely and inaccurate, and the bounty was changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
