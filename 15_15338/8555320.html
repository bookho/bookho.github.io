			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harvest is in the church. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at Emlin White aside and did not destroy the tranquil atmosphere here, deliberately screaming with a low voice, and asked: < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lack of money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an exit, he felt that he was asking Does the other person know Amway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin is a bit stunned, and immediately snoring:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not insult noble with money The blood family!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein paused and looked at the tall, burly priest Uttraski, who said casually:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I know, those hand-crafted dolls are not cheap, and can even be called expensive, especially those that are as high as people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Emlin's mouth opened, trying to refute, but ultimately failed to make a statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence for a while, he coughed twice and pretended not to open his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Tell me Well, what do you want me to do? I am not a bloody family who likes to guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t look at the vampire beside him, smiling :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a friend who is about to be promoted. I need to collect the corresponding extraordinary materials. I don't know if you can help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you doubting the ability of a bloody family?" Emlin White said arrogantly. "Even if I don't have one, I can write to ask those more noble lords."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I want... Klein immediately responded with enthusiasm:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thousand-faced hunters The pituitary of the brain, its blood 100 ml, human skin shadow characteristics, deep sea Naga's hair five, as long as you can get any of these, I will pay you, depending on the price, the price The cheaper you are, the more you will be paid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately reported more of the auxiliary material to avoid loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this completely unspeakable description, Emlin White had a feeling of falling into the trap of the other language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmed down the mood:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The extraordinary material is paid at least £100, auxiliary materials At least 10 pounds, although I don't know exactly what level you want, but I believe they will not be cheap or common, otherwise you can't come to me for help."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very smart... Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resale!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Emlin White was deeply skeptical that he had paid too little for his claim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he added another sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Detective, you have relieved the psychological suggestion Is there a clue?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sees the priest Utravsky in front of the altar is praying, looking at the vampire and looking at it:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have the easiest way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Emlin White White One bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Defeated the Utravsky bishop and snatched his 'heart candle'." Klein smirked. "After you and your parents, There should be enough strength. The three blood races are afraid that they won't win a 'Dawn Knight'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Lost.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"打打......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My father and mother were almost caught Up, that 'heart candle' is very sinister..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have already tried it... almost all of them have converted to the Mother Earth God... Did the blood family not win Father Utławsky? Is there such a horror that Father Uttraski, who is assisted by "heart licking candles" and "blood collectors"? Or is the vampire too weak? However, all the rumors think that the vampire is quite strong... Kline said thoughtfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you can write a letter to a more noble lord. Let's help, you shouldn't lack a strong person in your blood group."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin. White numbly replies:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They refused."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he looked at Klein with hope:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you win Father Utławsky? Or can your friend win him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get After "the sun brooch" and the "biotoxin bottle", and after digesting a lot of potions, I originally thought that I could win the Utravsky priest in the spirit state, but your description just made me not sure. Is the "heart candle" really so sinister? This seal was very restrained at first sight... Klein rationally shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly shifted the topic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did the noble lords of your blood family reject your request? For them, this should It’s just a simple help.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White’s face became like a cool ashes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They said that Father Uttraski is the leader of the 'Goddess of the Earth'. They don't want to directly collide with each other. They are studying other ways to relieve psychological cues, such as going to the Sunia Sea. , the foggy sea, the depths of the raging sea, looking for those dragons that have been seclusion for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughs more ugly than crying:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When they research, wait for them to find the dragon in the field of the soul, maybe I am already a faithful believer in the 'Goddess of the Earth'... I am coming now The more you feel that life is precious, the harvest is gratifying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of "The Mother Earth"? Father Uttraski is the leader of the "Goddess of the Earth"? No wonder he can have so many magical items... It seems that as a strong pirate, he suddenly changed his letter to "The Mother Earth" is not so simple... Klein first sighed, and then immediately feared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost immediately agreed to Emlin White’s request to try to defeat Father Utlavsky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you lose, I might be locked into the basement and forced to detain. If I win, then I will offend a god. No, I can’t win. The leader of the "Goddess of the Earth" must have a corresponding card. In the beginning, if neither Utovsky did suppress the split personality, I would not be able to beat him...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wisely did not go deep into this topic, once again looking directly at the front of the Utravsky priest: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can Try to find an organization called the Spiritual Alchemy Club."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise you can only wait for the "Justice" of our Tarot Club to become a "psychologist". Perhaps you have been reluctant to leave the faith of the "Goddess of the Earth"... Klein silently added a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, if Emlin White can join the psychological alchemy, it would be the best thing, so if Miss "Justice" is there When the organization encounters a situation, he can have other resources to help, instead of always summoning the fool, the deaf, and the believer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Psychological Alchemy? I haven't heard of it." Emlin shook his head. "It must be a hidden organization that has just appeared."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For a long-lived blood family, a hundred or two years is just the beginning of a long time, and those noble nobles may have been sleeping for a hundred years," said Emlin White. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Klein’s opening, he turned his eyes to the front and cleared his throat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know how to contact that organization?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wanted to answer a doctor named Dust Guderian in the madhouse of Tingen City is a psychological alchemy The members, but to the lips, have shrunk back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am being remembered by the "real creator", or do not have a relationship with the people and things of Tingen, there is a certain risk of exposure, and once exposed, With the madness of Aurora, I will definitely not let Banson and Melissa... Klein shook his head slightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just heard of this organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can write to ask other blood races. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White was disappointed, no longer mentioning this matter, looking at Klein sideways and snoring:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guess your friend who is about to be promoted is yourself. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the front without paying attention, and replied leisurely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations ,bingo. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Emlin White was on the spot, which was completely different from his expected reaction!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware of his changes, Klein laughed: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. White, the best career for you is not a pharmacist, but an actor. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin is a glimpse, and immediately arrogantly looks up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a The noble and noble blood family will not rely on looks to make a living. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think I am bragging about your handsomeness? Klein slowly got up and smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I mean, you have a comedy talent. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Emmling White's expression solidified, he squeezed into the hallway and left a sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't forget to delegate. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritzport, White Oak Street.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulswall arrived in the kingdom’s largest and most important port on a steam train early in the morning and booked the returning inland shipping ticket – which is relatively cheap <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathing the smell of the sea in the air, Fols saw a lot of dockers rushing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When the peak season, the port will flood into a lot of temporary workers, in order to get a relatively good reward, many poor people living in the eastern part of Beckland will also come to the southeast, relying on feet to walk 60 More than a kilometer away, this is the same as their participation in hops.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road is wider than Beckland, and the air quality is good, but relatively dirty It’s a lot dirty... Firth looked around and found the fishermen’s association in an old building.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of twists and turns, she simply saw Dorian Gray in an office.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gentleman is medium in size but has exaggerated arms and hair The grooming is quite neat, very different from the bird's nest-like hairstyle of the association.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should also be Abraham...Fuls simply explained the intention, The suicide note left by Lawrence was handed to the other party along with the strange notebook and the extraordinary characteristics of diamonds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
