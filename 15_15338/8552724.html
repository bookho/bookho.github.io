			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't touch Zerrell's body, so he quit the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden sound coming from the air, constantly reverberating in the empty and clear sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened for a few seconds and decisively withdrew to the exit along the dirty cement road on either side of the sewage river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For him, there is absolutely no need to take risks without involving himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After climbing off the sewer, Klein re-closed the iron cover and handled the neighborhood slightly before returning to the one-bedroom apartment he rented in the Eastern District. The clothes were removed and the camouflage was removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he put on the gold-rimmed glasses, walked to another street, took the rental carriage, and returned to the Jowood area in the quiet and cold at three in the morning. But not Minsk Street. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Klein circled a big circle, confirmed that no one followed, only to enter their own home, until the sky was bright, the doorbell swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed over and sat up, put on his shirt, buckled his vest, and quickly stepped down to the first floor and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, the premonition ability of the "Clown" sequence has made him naturally outline the visitor's image in his mind:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uneven old coat, dome brown hat, tattered satchel, bright red eyes, delicate face, quiet temperament, is the big boy who commissioned the task yesterday. Yep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, detective Moriarty." Ian greeted, and looked around. "Is there something to gain? Well... I am By the way, I would like to ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein Zheng focuses on:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Ian seemed to be shocked, and couldn’t speak for a long time. After a while, he licked his lips and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Er’s situation?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Yes.” Kleinton paused, and he said, “I found Zerel’s body.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The body..." Ian’s pupils shrank and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not too surprised, it seems that he has expected this worst result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked quietly and never interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call..." Ian sighed and looked around with a vigilance. "Your efficiency is amazing, you can take me to see it." Mr. Zerrell's body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, in fact, I am planning to do this." Klein thought, "I hope you call the police." Don't mention me when you say it, just say what you found, I think you know how to weave the reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian is no surprise about this, he is very clear, Not every detective likes to deal with the police. In fact, in addition to being famous, the big detectives who often provide advice and help to the police department, others are discriminated against by the police, rejected by them, and even extorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the status quo of the Kingdom of Lun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Ian readily agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering the need to enter the sewer, Klein changed the clothes of the ordinary labor class, wore a top hunting deer cap, and took a horse-drawn lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two arrived in the Eastern District by public carriage, walking in a pair of double or numb or malicious eyes, walking for half an hour to the remote sewer entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked down and replied casually: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Skillful training, which includes many techniques of reasoning, investigation, tracking and cross-examination."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian followed the entry into the sewer and nodded disgustingly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...you seem to have received very professional training "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't have a positive answer, taking advantage of the already lit lantern, and Ian turned into the winding road to the gloomy corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His eyes were slightly stunned when he was close, because Zerrell’s body was much more crippled than last night, with one arm and half rib missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not what the mouse can do... Klein secretly swears, not reminding Ian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the light of the lantern, Ian saw the look of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed down, vomited, and gradually vomited the yellow-green bile, Klein took out the prepared "Crag oil", screwed Open the cork, bend over and put the port in front of Ian's nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian Horan took a clever move and eased it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, he whispered weakly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly stood up and scrutinized the incomplete corpse several times:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I can confirm that he is the detective of Zerrell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately." Klein responded politely, "I suggest you call the police."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Ian nodded invisibly and followed the other side back to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein took a shot:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My task ends here, after What to do is up to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian is silent for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still owe you three things, you can tell me now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I only thought about one for the time being." Klein I replied calmly, "I want to know where guns and bullets can be obtained, and I don't need a full-use weapon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian barely thought about it. Said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beckland Bridge area, Tiemen Street, 'Brave Bar", looking for Casper. Kanlinen, it is said to be ' The old man's introduced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, the remaining two things will be said later, I have a hunch, we will meet again." Klein Make a nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian looked at him and kept his state silent, saying nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two separated and went to different streets in the Eastern District, and the remote places restored their silence again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Klein suddenly turned and returned, then hid in the hidden corner and peered at the entrance to the sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for two or three minutes, he saw Ian returning quietly and looking around with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took back his sight in time, leaning against the wall and listening to the start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the friction of the iron cover being removed and heard someone climbing down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cautiously revealing his head, Klein found that Ian had re-entered the sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who had met the curiosity, stopped staying, really left, and planned to go to Casper Kanlining in two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon tea, Viscount Glylint is located in the home of Queens . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the study was closed, and the four people inside were completely separated from the guests who participated in the salon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hugh, Fols, this is the reward you deserve." Audrey wearing a long yellow dress with a lot of lace, will bulge The envelope was pushed to the two ladies across the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh is a polite one, but her hand has grabbed the envelope one step faster and felt the weight of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had to say sincerely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Audrey, thank you for your generosity, you The integrity makes you more beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, she has untied the thin line around the envelope and saw the banknote inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a gray-colored banknote with a neat and uniform color. It is thick and exudes a special ink scent, which makes people feel refreshed and scented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"10 pounds..." Hugh took out a piece and confirmed the denomination. Fols, who seemed to be lazy and careless about money, didn’t know when he came over. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, at least... take a look at the thickness and figure out how many sheets there are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but look at Fols and saw the strangeness in each other’s eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is significantly more rewarding than they imagined! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A total of 800 pounds, you decide how to allocate." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry that that thing has caused you to be in danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 800 pounds... No, no need to apologize... Once again, even if I know the possible consequences, I will accept the commission... Even if it is just a split, plus my savings, it is enough to buy the formula of the "Sheriff" potion. It’s... I’m looking at the banknotes in the envelope in the early hours of the first meter, and I’m sorry to take them all out and count them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She believes that the generous and generous beauty of Miss Audrey is definitely not a shortfall, but what if the other party is wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has a mistake! Hugh raised his right hand, paused for a few seconds, and silently let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fols's mouth can't stop rising, feeling: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is better than me This book of Stormwind has received more total remuneration so far..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should I praise Miss Audrey, or is it the self-deprecating writer's poverty? She added a word silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Priest Glenlint sitting on the sofa is also a bit envious, but not Yan Yanxiu and Fulth, as a good financial viscount, 800 The pound is not a large number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is envious of Audrey’s boldness and no burden at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough..." Viscount Glenlint cleared his throat. "If you can get the formula of 'pharmacist', I will give you a lot of money." Reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We try our best!" Hugh did not hesitate to answer, then she looked to Audrey, "We have recently been exposed to suspected psychological alchemy The person who meets, the 'spectator' potion you want will soon have clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh, I have sequence 8, it is better than you... Audrey laughed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
