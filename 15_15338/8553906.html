			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White feathers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the grave without bones, and Horan thought of a word:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Angel! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the classics of the Seven Great Churches, there are legends of angels and saints, and one of the characteristics of the former is that there are two pairs, two pairs Three pairs, even six pairs of white pure wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the blink of an eye, Klein remembered another story:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick The gentleman once described his dreams to him and described the dreams that are like life in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One scene is in the dark mausoleum, with many open coffins next to it, and a coffin with white feathers behind it. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a special manifestation of the "Death" approach, or is it a strange phenomenon made by the Spiritual Regiment? Klein didn't open his mouth, convulsed all kinds of emotions, and calmly looked at the white feathers on the bottom of the tomb that were stained with light butter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He initially judged that the old gentleman would not be an angel, because the horror of Sequence 2 or even Sequence 1 will definitely have a strong influence on the surroundings, such as The “Saint Ashes” behind the Chanis Gate in Tingen City will extend the almost invisible black, cold, thin lines to seal the people and things around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, maybe he didn’t really die...just like Mr. Azick? Klein bent down and picked up three white feathers with his right palm in black gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——He plans to go home and go to the fog to make a divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Coptic slowed down and even climbed to the side of Klein, looking at the grave road with fear:<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein looked at him sideways and lowered his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, he left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going yourself..."Copsti Repeated in horror, fully aware of how terrible the wake of the deceased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shivered and said to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, but, I didn't use him for him, and he used the resurrection ceremony for him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned his body and watched him for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death is not the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Death is not the end... Death is not the end..." Copthorne is believed by himself Scared, he asked, "He, will he come back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the copper whistle summoned the messenger, the big probability corresponds to that The old gentleman, that is to say, giving the note to the messenger is equivalent to sending the letter to the old gentleman, sending a letter to a person who has been dead for almost half a year... Oh, I don’t know where he is now, what state he is in... ... For Coptic's question, Klein gave an understatement: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not blow that copper whistle again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, He would whistle lure back? "Kao Pu Sidi frightened to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Klein replied, he asked himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, you Can you throw this copper whistle into the Tsock River?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If not, then, then I will go."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you not interested in death to the corresponding philosophy? Klein groaned and reached for the copper whistle belonging to Copthorne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the premise of all this is that he is not too dangerous. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Copstead re-buried the grave, Klein exchanged a "spiritual dance" and corresponding occult knowledge with him, enriching himself. When I saw the old gentleman who was buried in Copstead, I had to follow the other’s will and let the body face down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some special cases, the use of "spiritual dance" instead of part of the ritual magic of the cumbersome arrangement will be more effective and simpler... seeing the goal, Klein He also warned Copthorne that he should stop playing the so-called resurrection ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he left the street from the garden and took a carriage to the east for a long distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After changing the previous clothes, he returned to Minsk Street, entered the bedroom, after a series of operations, three white feathers and Copthorne's copper whistle Brought to the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting to the high back chair belonging to the Fool, Klein has a paper pen, writing a divination statement that he has long thought of:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's the origin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he held the three white feathers and leaned back against the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meditation, Klein entered the dream, surrounded by fascination, gray and rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, there is a dark, dark darkness. Suddenly, the darkness is stained with blushing color, and a pale hand reveals yellow. Brown soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure slowly climbed up. He did not open the slate, stirred the soil, but penetrated like that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the moonlight of the blush, the clothes behind the figure were ragged and grew a white feather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person with white hair has a slight side, revealing the obvious erythema of the face, as well as the wood, the dull, the eyes without any emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a step, struggling to penetrate the fence, going deeper into the black, going further and further, until it disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream was broken and Klein woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is really a white feather behind the body...It’s very similar to Miss Sharon, but it’s obviously different, it’s very heavy It’s a real, unreal feeling... It seems to be a semi-naturally incomplete transition between the human body and the spirit. Communicating the real world and the messenger of the spiritual world? Klein reached out and tapped the edge of the long table and meditated for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he is divining now whether it is dangerous to use the Copthorne copper post to send a letter, get a positive answer, and the extent of the swing Very large and fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, there is no way to use the copper whistle directly on the fog, the messenger can't get in, otherwise there is no danger..." Klein said to himself. After one sentence, he fell into the fog and returned to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, the relatively fresh woods of Queens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face is round and the 30-year-old pharmacist appears in a secluded corner, and the secretly planted herbs are included in the carry-on bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing today's mission, he straightened his waist and moved to the body, silently saying to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, physical fitness has improved, no longer as strong as toxins in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... Why is my sequence 8 a 'tamer'? What does this have to do with 'pharmacists'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the pharmacist is domesticating and using plants and lost Some part of the animal of life, the animal trainer is domesticated and uses living animals, including extraordinary creatures?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old man didn't tell me the name of sequence 7, nor gave me a recipe. When I stabilized, I have to try to contact him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharmacist punches and kicks , adapt to the strong body, until it is too tired to stop the action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call...hepatically, he began to think about a serious question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is taming How should the beastmaster play? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The animal trainer... What should I do? Looking for animals to be domesticated?" In the pharmacist's shackles, suddenly there was some sense and I looked at the artificial lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a golden retriever dog running there cheerfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have noticed his sight, and the Golden Retriever dog snarled and looked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of sight collided in mid-air, and the golden-haired big dog slammed, and immediately turned to the body, and the smoke disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The luxury villa in the Earl of Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi returned to the piano room, squatting at Audrey’s feet, vomiting his tongue and panting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the blonde girl plays a song, it is afraid to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Audrey I met a terrible guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His eyes are terrible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes? What does he want to do to you?" Audrey asked curiously and with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi seriously thought: "I don't know, in short, he is very dangerous, this is my instinct."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does he look like?" Audrey considered whether to let the guards and attendants at home warn the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't see it clearly, I feel, I feel that he is my natural enemy!" Su Shi answered in a serious manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your natural enemies? Dogs nemesis? Audrey reveals a reserved smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Su Shi, you haven't been to the woods recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Wang, Audrey, you just didn't feel good? I heard it from your piano voice." Su Shi asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey gently slammed the first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... I just got from Grein I received the news there, and Firth and Hugh told me that the party tonight was cancelled. I originally intended to exchange you for extraordinary materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Trying to contact the psychological alchemists... she silently added a sentence in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Su Shi asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey thinks and answers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that the impact of the serial killings "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday morning, Beckland’s air is as usual difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is trying to make a pasta that he loves when he was a child. For this reason, he bought a higher quality flour, added water and sugar, and turned it into a pot. Thin "paper". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he poured oil into the pot and wetted the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the heat, he picked up some noodles with a spoon and poured them to the side of the pot, which was very thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
