			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Son of the Creator? "The hanging man" Alger was also shocked by the description of the "hidden" and couldn't help but move his eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn't ask directly, because it is likely to expose something, and he believes that there will be members who will take the initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Son of the Creator?" At this time, "Magic" Foers asked with great interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not expect Amon to have such a shocking identity in addition to the title of "God of God" and "King of Angels". Full of curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "hidden" Jia Delia glanced at her and said the same tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the original creator was divided into various races of various gods, two babies were born in his body, one of which was the '渎神者' Amon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The murals in the mausoleum of Amon are not quite the same as what you described. When Amon and Adam were born, the creator just woke up for a long time, took back the authority of the ancient gods, and sat down on the holy mountain. The pile of angels is surrounded by praise, there is no sign of death differentiation...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mural has something in common with the history recorded in Silver City... Perhaps the Creator I really woke up twice, or maybe the original creator and Amon's father, the creator in the Silver City record is not the same, the two belong to the inheritance relationship..." Klein listened to the story of Ms. I have made some speculation in my heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amon actually still The Son of the Owner... This identity is no worse than the true God! And "Mr. Fool", and our Tarot will easily purify his avatar and solve his possession... "Justice" Audrey recalls Before I started, I suddenly felt that I was really unknowingly surpassing many ordinary people. The circle and level of the two sides are more than 100 times different!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is quite I am interested to ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. 'Hidden', do you know who the other creator is? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adam. "The Hidden" Jia Delia spit out a short word.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......"Justice" Audrey was obviously stunned because her problem only needed The other party's answer knows or doesn't know. After getting the "know" answer, she will specifically ask for advice and declare that she is willing to pay. Who knows, the "invisible" lady gave the name "Adam" directly.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't care too much about this knowledge...She has a lot of knowledge... Audrey infers something from this detail, and her eyes turn slightly:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never heard of a big man named Adam. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't have it, except that it is recorded as the Son of the Creator, He is like never seen. There seems to be no existence in the history of the Quaternary." trace. "The Hidden" Jia De Li Ya responded frankly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Adam is very mysterious...I am Quaternary Solomon, Tudor and Terence Soest The angel family to which the great empires belonged has already had a very deep understanding, but they have never heard of him. If it was not for that time, Arrods gave me a live broadcast of the steam church to explore the mausoleum of Amon. I didn’t even have his name. Clearly... Is He prematurely degraded, or hiding in the dark, planning what? Klein lamented a few words in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey is subconscious I saw the other person "slowing down the man" and found that the other party also shook his head gently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amon is the king of angels, Adam is not reasonable, the record of Silver City should be There is... "Justice" Audrey immediately looks at the "Sun" Dairik.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't know why, Dairik easily understands Miss Justice I want to express the meaning, slightly shyly said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We don't know Adam, just like I don't know Amon the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not been able to find the ancient books related to the King of Angels before. I think because I was still low in sequence and not qualified, I will try to continue searching. Information in this regard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that she is asking questions now, and Miss "Justice" will definitely answer, so I have no waiting, and I will speak directly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amon belongs to the king of angels in your mouth. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." "Justice" Audrey in order to thank Ms. "Hidden" before the generosity, explained in detail, "The record in Silver City Among them, the creator is surrounded by countless angels, among which the leaders of the angels, the eight closest to the throne, are called the king of angels.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are not many kings of angels that we can determine at present. One is the 'Destiny Angel' of Ulumos, which originated from the ancient books of Silver City. His title is 'swallower' and the other is 'red' mentioned by Mr. Fool. Angel 'Medic, also known as 'war angels', the third is speculation, we suspect that Amon is the 'time angel' in the king of angels. Since he is the king of angels, Adam, who is also the son of the Creator, is probably also. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much to be sure... I don’t know the title of the king of angels, but you have already mastered half of it. This is not much? Your sequence Not even one is taller than me... "The Hidden" Jia De Li Ya almost can't speak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, "Moon" Emlin is really After figuring out the meaning of the king of angels and deciding to return to the real world, according to these names, look for the traces of the remaining kings of angels from the hidden history of the blood family.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Hidden" Jia Delia was silent for two seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Sun" was once possessed by Amon? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, that is his avatar." "The Sun" Dairik replied honestly, "However, it has been purified by Mr. Fool, and I have not suffered any harm." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was purified by Mr. "The Fool"... "The Hidden" Jia De Li Ya held back the impulse to look at the top of the bronze long table.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She originally thought that she had initially figured out the status of Mr. Fool, knowing that he is still recovering and that there is not much power to use, so he will seek "Poseidon" The identity, got the scepter, but now the situation has shaken the speculation, I feel that "fool" is like an iceberg, the part hidden under the sea is more horrible, more difficult to speculate!<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He easily defeated Amon’s plan... In some cases, can he briefly break through the restrictions and exert the power of the gods? Jia Delia’s heart is calm, no more questions, Cautiously closed his mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "Justice" Audrey remembered some of the previous doubts because of this topic, and asked: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. 'Hidden', Amon was separated by Mr. Fool’s, Leaving a transparent circle with 12 worms, it is said to be called 'worm when the' Is it true? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes. "The Hidden" Jia Delia recalled two seconds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which way does it belong? I mean, which extraordinary way does the ‘God of God’ approach? "Audrey curiously asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Delia replied without thinking, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The thief's approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rumors have reached the ranks of the Holy One or the Angels, they can deceive the fate, defraud the rules, become the parasite of time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds very powerful... "Justice" Audrey sighs with a sigh of relief and asks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's the time What can insects use for?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask! "The Fool" Klein sang for Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is in a good spirit, waiting for the answer from Ms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——There is just a “bug in time” in his sundries! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a spiritual, unique material that can be used in certain rituals or to make advanced spells, but specifically how to do it, I don't Clear." After the "hidden" Jia Delia answered, suddenly there was some embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
