			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the living room, the Countess Caitlin sat on the sofa, standing in front of the deputy butler, the housekeeper assistant and the deacon of the corresponding affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is well-organized, and does not arbitrarily tell the various things of today's dinner, until her daughter Audrey comes to her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, I have something to tell you." Audrey's eyes swept over the rest of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to the living room, she felt the floor tremble slightly, but found no other abnormalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Countess looked around and slammed it first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will come back later. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living room quickly became quiet, and even the golden-haired big dog Su Shi was taken out by Audrey with his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should always be with me and learn how to handle affairs, although there is no such thing in your family curriculum, but how to relate them to reality Effective combination is still a profound knowledge." Over 50 years old, the countess, who seems to be only in her early thirties, smiled and educated, "Okay, my little angel, what do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey wants to reveal the elegant smile that has been practiced repeatedly in the etiquette class, but finds that he is too nervous to tilt his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She licks her dry lips and speaks directly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom, me Something is glaring at you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?" The countess slightly turned her head and waited for a subsequent explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey's words are first and foremost, and immediately become smooth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have, I am already an extraordinary person, that is, a person with magical ability, by becoming a potion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde Countess Caitlin light eyebrows , no surprise response:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My father and I know . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? "Audrey didn't know how to pick up the text.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countess smiled and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You took so many magical materials from the treasure house, do you still naively think that I and your father are not aware?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your father's side, in this villa, in the family's territory, there are many extraordinary people, they are either from a pure employment relationship, or from The dispatch of the goddess church, or itself is a member of the Hall family, the majesty of the king acquiesced in these things, and we also acquiesced in your little adventure, hey, you will grow up, mature, my father and I can not always Protecting you under your own wings, when you always need to face something on your own, there is extra magical ability to help your cards better.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well, according to the common sense I know, the initial stage should be less dangerous. It takes a year, two years, or even three years to improve. So, my father and I are not in a hurry and are planning to wait for you. I will tell you a few words in the official adulthood, so that you will stay in your present position. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Mom, your common sense is wrong, you don't know the existence of the law, if the materials are in place, I will become the sequence 7 years ago. "Psychologist"... And, I don't want to stop, the death of the Duke of Nigan makes me understand that the world is not as stable and calm as I thought, I want to have a critical moment to protect your strength...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool" gradually recovered, and a bitter god tried to come. Although I was not mature enough, lacked the necessary insights, I could also detect the hidden indescribable from these things. Crisis... Audrey has always been very clear that the extraordinary materials he took from the treasure house are inescapable, but he is fortunate enough to think that parents do not know the specific role of those items, and at most doubt their own circle of occult enthusiasts. The deeper and deeper the inside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After unloading the burden of the heart, she avoided the mother’s embarrassment and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom, I later joined a secret organization, and I don't want to say the name and details of the situation. I forgive me for the name and details. I have made an oath for this."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under waiting for the countess to ask, she is the first to get to the point:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I received a message today, Edessa The civilian girl that Prince Ke loved was a witch. They didn’t know what plot to plot.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no necessary links between the two paragraphs before and after. It is the "Psychological Alchemy Association". The source of the news is Tarot, and it is Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a word arrangement, every sentence of her is true, can be confirmed by divination, but will make people believe that her message comes from "mental alchemy society" "This secret organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on Caitlin’s face gradually disappeared, and he solemnly asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Witch?”< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t know much about the mysterious world, but only this noun can make her feel evil and uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey quickly nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, a 'happy witch' "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What scares me even more is that her name is Trichic. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the problem?" The countess asked with doubts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In that organization, members saw the name Chik in an old book. "Audrey said that the lie that was just compiled, no matter the tone, the words, the details of the expression, or the physical movements, is not flawed. "In the Quaternary or earlier, it belonged to the original witch. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, she added: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is a evil spirit! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Countess Caitlin does not understand the meaning of the "original witch" representative, but she knows what the evil spirit means.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly couldn’t sit still, and the speed of speech quickly reversed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...not sure. "Audrey did not doubt the "fool" without any doubt, but she could not say it on the surface. "In any case, I think it is necessary to ask the royal family. No, please ask the extraordinary people of the goddess church to make certain confirmations, involving evil spirits." Things, how careful you are, are all right. "[< /> /> </ br> <br /> <br /> Li, you are growing up. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it wasn't for the urgency, I heard that the praise of Audrey was pretending to be reserved, first modest and spoiled, then returning to the room to smug, even a short dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, she simply can’t take care of it, and she is so busy that emotions such as worry and tension appear on the surface:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom, can you hide it for me? I have heard that the extraordinary people of the church and the royal family are extremely abhorrent to the secret organizations that do not belong to them. Hey, you can say that it is the news that Dad got, he should have many channels. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine stood up and gave her daughter a hug:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You rest assured, I And your father won't let you get involved in this kind of thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your father will come back in the evening, I will let the hidden guard appear first, pretend that he passed the message, and then go to the goddess church to protect us. "The extraordinary person of a family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good!" Audrey was pleased to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, she finally sighed and was exhausted by the high tension that had been maintained for some time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching a few flame-burning meteorites fall at high speed, covering the entire forest, Klein had the idea of ​​being unable to compete, desperate and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if he continues to use the flame jump, he can’t get out of the woods in the “meteor shower” and get out of the dangerous core area, and use the “divination” approach. The extraordinary body is not vulnerable, and there is no possibility of hard meteorites. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even a living corpse that cannot be wounded by a pistol, under such an "attack", will directly become a piece of meat or meat, and it is a kind of blackened ... Flame jump... The yellowish white light reflected in the depths of the eye, and Klein, who had never given up, quickly came up with an idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this second-calculated scene, he did not hesitate and decided to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a good distance, Klein snapped a finger and let the remaining flame in the matchbox be ignited at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A red glow leaps up and quickly wraps his figure inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, Klein disappeared in place, flashing in the flame above the meteorite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swipe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meteor quickly fell, he just jumped out of the flame, he left the rock and fell into the air of high ambient temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of jumping with extraordinary ability, Klein is not afraid of ordinary flames, even if the temperature is higher, but he can only get out of that state. Trying to manipulate the flame to avoid yourself will also be burned to death by burns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the high temperature air is not within the scope of his "jumping". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein made another snap to explode the air at the critical point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flashed in another flame, trying to avoid the first wave of impact from the meteorite hitting the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no matter how he tries, how to take risks, he still can’t get out of danger, leaving only two choices, or jumping to avoid the frontal woods. Withstand the impact of the meteorite drop, or jump around on the top performing acrobatics, waiting for the "Mushroom Cloud" to engulf him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, Klein seems to see himself torn apart, the body is black, especially the appearance of the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart thoughts flashed, his eyes suddenly changed, red is redder, yellow is yellower, white is whiter, various colors are superimposed, depicting A strange oil painting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oil painting" seems to be out of the real world, let Klein watch as the "slow" where the meteorite falls, hit the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woods were instantly destroyed, the earth swayed a few times, and the smoke mixed with fire rose up, forming a mushroom-like strange cloud . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of shock did not affect Klein because it simply couldn’t get into the overlapping of patches, like the static “painting world”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein was a glimpse, and immediately saw a lot of people next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure is medium-sized, with bronze skin, a long black dress, a half-high silk hat, and a pair of brown eyes that show the vicissitudes of life. To be soft, there is a small black scorpion under the right ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Azick!" Klein rejoiced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally knows what the revelation gained from divination corresponds to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It corresponds to the present! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood Sea" represents a mortal situation, "pused by Mr. Azick" means that he is rescued by him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just left his mouth, but Azick waved his hand and grabbed his arm and walked toward the depths of the rich colors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
