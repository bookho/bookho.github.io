			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dixie County, Connaught City, 67 Hong Wu Tong Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is facing the more common face of the Zhang Lun Kingdom, stepping forward and ringing the doorbell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than a minute, the door slammed open, and a maid probe wearing a black and white dress looked for a few seconds, wondering: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, which one are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking for Mrs. Nelu, I am her father. David Raymond's friend," Klein replied calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Raymond is the "nightmare" he released from "squirming hunger" and the "red glove" in the "Night of the Night". The last thing he missed was his daughter Nicole Raymond, who was not able to accompany her to grow up, so that she lost her father and lost her father. Klein promised him. If there is a chance, he will come to this beautiful. The seaside city helped him see how his daughter was doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the inquiries, Klein has preliminarily grasped the general situation of Nicole Raymond. After graduating from Grammar School, the girl entered the Church of the Night Goddess. The "Caring for Women's Fund" work, the weekly salary reached 2 pounds and 10 sul, is the object of envy of neighbors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also inherited a legacy from her "businessman" father, specifically how much, others are not very clear, only know that she has more than most middle class money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, this kind of girl with sufficient wealth will be very cautious about marriage, will be repeatedly selected and inspected, so that she often gets married late, but Nilu works Just one year later, I was married to a government employee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because both sides believe in the "night goddess", she does not have a husband's surname, still called Nilu Raymond, still living at 67 Hong Wu Tong Street , never moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Klein’s answer, the maid was busy asking him to wait a moment and turned to the living room to report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, a woman wearing a home dress went to the door, her brunette blue eyes, her cheeks were slender, the facial features were not bad, and David Raymond is a bit like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, sir, I am the daughter of David Raymond, when did you meet my father?" Nicole Raymond Polite but alertly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took off his hat and smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know at sea, already It’s been several years.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero.Raymond swept the opposite side with a vigilant look:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Maybe you still don't know, he has passed away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I know that I and I met in that disaster. He said something at the time. I didn't care much about it. But the more I think about it, the more I think I should let you know."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Nilu whispered and thought, "Please come in, do you mind if my husband listens together?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is only relevant to your decision." Kline responded calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nina nodded her head and led Klein into the study. Her husband, a government employee of ordinary temperament, put down the newspaper and followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the two sides sat down separately, Klein looked at the couple on the opposite sofa and thought about the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Mr. David Raymond experienced a disaster and lost his father, mother, wife, brother and sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero has nothing The expression nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it and continued :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a businessman on the surface, but he is actually chasing the murderers who caused the disaster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Nina spoke up without much reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at her and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He devoted himself wholeheartedly This thing, unfortunately, has not been able to accompany you to grow up, so that when you lose your mother, you almost lost your father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina is silent Seconds, the speed of speech responds quickly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's gaze Sweeping through the old books around, silently sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said that his greatest hope is to see you in the witness of the goddess, have their own Marriage and family, no longer alone, I think he should be very pleased now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nilu’s eyes slowly removed from Kline’s face, his mouth opened It took two seconds to answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein Body Slightly forward, hand in hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;"He said that he may die at sea, let me tell you that he died because of an accident, all the murderers have been disciplined before, you do not need to hate anyone.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He also said that he loves you very much, he is very sorry. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nina silently for a few seconds, rubbed her eyes, looked sideways, and sighed unconsciously:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gave her a deep look and slowly got up:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already passed the transfer, I should leave. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite response was silent, and Nilu’s husband gently decapitated and thanked him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein turned his body and walked to the door of the study. He just turned the handle, and suddenly there was a voice behind him. Raymond became a low and hoar voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, think, what kind of person is he? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was silent for a second, went back and raised his mouth, smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "A guardian. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped staying, opened the door of the study, and walked to the coat rack position.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When he put on a hat and left the 67th Street of Red Wutong Street, a thin, hard-pressed cry suddenly sounded into his ear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Silently shaking his head, Klein left the block and entered the church of the goddess of the night.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the deep, quiet aisle, he sat down to the countdown In the seven rows, facing the dark black emblem with half a red moon and a star, take off the top hat, bury your head, and hold your hands in front of your mouth, like most believers here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silent silence and tranquility, time flies, Klein slowly opens his eyes and moves very gently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The location where he sat, left a group of things wrapped in paper.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walked out of the hall and walked out of the prayer hall. At the door of the church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his back, put on his top hat, raised his right hand, and snapped a finger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;啪!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper in his previous position was suddenly ignited, causing the attention of the priest, waiting for the gentleman to rush over, the flame has been extinguished, stay The next group of dark, glorious gem-like gums.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Although the priest did not know what the gums were, but inspiration Tell him that this is important!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he and other pastors chased outside the church, the gentleman who was wearing a half-high hat was wearing a swallowtail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who gained a new identity through the local black market, came to the steam train site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds a second-class ticket worth 18 Soleil and his own identity document in one hand, carrying a black leather suitcase and standing upright on the platform. On, wait for the train to Beckland to arrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present is a middle-aged man of nearly forty years old. His height is 180, his hair is mixed with a touch of silver, and his blue eyes are like the lake at night. The five senses are quite eye-catching, with a mature taste and refined temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at the identity document in hand, Klein’s eyes reflected his current name:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dawn. Dontes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, he put the suitcase on the ground, spread it open, and then showed proof of identity The documents were all stuffed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this suitcase, there is a black wooden box containing the ashes of former Ron soldier Longzel and Edward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just finished the box, the sound of the sound rang from the ear, a steam train sprayed with smoke, and when it entered the platform, it stopped quickly and slowly. It’s down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his head, turned his gaze to the front, looked at his eyes silently, and whispered aloud to the suitcase:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is going back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately stood up, put on his belongings, step by step to the opened door of the carriage . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Jowood, 26 Kings Street . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson took off his hat, took off his coat, and handed it over to the maid, looking at the sister Mei Lisha who was reading in the living room:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "June is the entrance exam, and you can finally understand the pain of studying hard before me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa didn't look up and still read the book:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I study hard every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; &nbsp; "Humorous point, Melissa, humor, what is the difference between people who don't understand humor and curls?" Banson said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa looked at him at random:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't say that before. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not go to the point where the difference between the tangled person and the curler was, and instead asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Do government employees wait so late to finish their work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, just a lot of things recently, you know, oh, you don't know, In this big change, the handover of front and back work, the rationalization of different relationships, are very troublesome.” Banson’s eyes swept through a mirror in the living room, and couldn’t help but raise his hand to manage his hair. His expression was not too happy. Said, "Although I am only a small employee of the Ministry of Finance, this does not prevent me from having a lot of work. The only thing that comforts me is that I finally have a damn internship. Then I will have a weekly salary of 3 pounds. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa put down the book and said to Benson as she walked to the restaurant:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s time for dinner.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused and said very seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I read the newspaper before and said that there is a thing called the sap of the Dorningsman tree, which is very effective for the growth of hair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson’s expression changed It is very complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
