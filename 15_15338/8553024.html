Fols touched the earlobe and suspected that he had got it wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful, innocent, curious, ignorant Miss Audrey will give the assassination mission! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the goal is the ambassador of the Northern Territory powerhouse Intis! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh is slow, hesitating to answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our strength, no, Not enough to complete this task."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing she measured was the difficulty of the mission! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey ignored the question of Fols and asked them to imagine the reason, the dimples said shallowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not letting you accept the commission, but I hope that you will find someone who can do it. For example, Mr. A, I will pay 4,000 pounds for this. Of course, this is just my initial offer. "Specific can also be negotiated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If things can succeed in the end, I will give you a fee of 500 pounds, even if it fails, there are 200 pounds, because you bear the risk "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accumulated annuity balance that she has not invested in, plus the remaining bounty, has a look of 13,000 pounds, but if too much is used, It will definitely attract the attention of Count Earl, and even the Balvest Bank will do some investigation. After calculation, she thinks that 5,000 pounds is the tipping point, and it is best not to exceed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4000 gold pound... Hugh heard his heavy breathing, but she quickly became depressed, she knew that she could not take the task . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in our name to ask other extraordinary people, there is a reward of 500 pounds... Miss Audrey is the most generous party I have ever seen. pretty girl! Hugh quickly returned to reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folse is a full-blown doubt:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Audrey Why should you entrust such a task? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristocratic circle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Premeditated to provoke a prelude to war? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the big names represented by Earl Hall hope that the situation will become chaotic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two quickly contacted Mr. A through the agreed channels. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, when the rare sunlight penetrated the fog and illuminated the entire Beckland, the house that had come to the party before, saw the hood and the legs, but gave the impression of being high. Mr. A. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said that there are important things to find me?" Mr. A's eyes moved back and forth between the two ladies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that some female extraordinary people used the body to change from the A to the potion material... He is really a disgusting metamorphosis...Fols mouth micro Hook and laugh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a big deal, don't you know that you are not interested?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mr. A swept his face and smiled low: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's talk, let me hear what big deal."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resist the urge to pull out the three-sided thorn, and use the arbitrator’s tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ambassador of the Kingdom to the Kingdom, Becker Lang Jean Mardin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mr. A suddenly fell silent, but because the expression was covered by the shadow of the hood, Hugh and Buddha Ersi couldn't guess what he was thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he slowly leaned back and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"4000 gold pounds, in addition, we will provide the corresponding information, for example, Ambassador Becker is the sequence of the 'hunter' route 6 'conspirators', there may be an assistant of sequence 5, for example, his weakness is beauty. "Hume is trying to make Mr. A feel that this task is hopeful." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. A low laugh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can pick up this task, but the reward must be improved. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first choice, the 'no darkness', 'disaster master', 'prophet' or 'operator' potion formula, of course, Their value is higher than this task, they don't need to be complete, and some can do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second choice, 10,000 gold pounds, oh, this is' Hurricane Lieutenant 'Qilingus's reward amount, Becker's strength is certainly not comparable to him, but there are powerful assistants, and, believe me, he has absolutely magical items."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reasonable price, but also an exaggerated price... Hugh and Firth look at each other:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let’s go back and discuss I will reply you here at this time tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Mr. A made a gesture of sending guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being taken out of the house by the waiter, Fols whispered in confusion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is it a high-sequence formula?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Frankly speaking, I am very surprised, I thought that Mr. A would only have recipes or potion materials, and money for him. It should not be a necessity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the good friend:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fors You really are just a simple clinic doctor and writer. You must know that Mr. A must have a lot of people. They need a house to sleep, they need to fill their stomachs, buy clothes, and vent their desires. These must be exchanged for money, and, for a certain For some broken aristocrats, as long as there is a golden pound, what can't be sold?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. A without his men would be equally terrible, but his message will be very "Occlusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is something that the gangsters in the Eastern District know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fol Wrinkle Under the face: "Hugh, you are not so stupid..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, the two met the familiar Golden Retriever dog at the scheduled place. , transferred Mr. A’s reply to Audrey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey looked at the note, not only did not embarrassed, but a long sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a wonderful thing for her to solve the ambassador with 10,000 pounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only use 5,000 pounds for the time being, and I have to pay Hugh and Fols 500 pounds... Well, I borrowed from Grein. Borrowing 6,000 pounds, no, 8,000 pounds, my daily expenses can't reveal the problem, then return him in four to five months, interest is 1,000 pounds... By the new year, I will be quite tight, only 1000 pounds per month... ... Audrey made a quick decision, then burned the original note and wrote it on a new paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second option, prepaid 2,000 pounds Wait for the task to be completed, and then give the remaining 8,000 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 15th Street, Klein saw Mary Gale again at tea time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the initiative to meet each other through Mrs. Starling Summer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Mary, after tracking, I found out that your husband went to the Cragg Club because I am not a member of them, so I can’t enter, but according to my observation, Half an hour after your husband left, there was only one young lady who came out, she was called Elika Taylor, who lived at 126 New Year Road, Hilston District. She worked at Coimham for a while and still It’s unemployed, I took a photo of her leaving the Craig Club.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary’s expression was gloomy and silent for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You must get their intimate substantive evidence, um... is the Craig Club, right? I will Find two members to introduce you to the conference, but your information must be filled in 'well-known big detectives', and people are not allowed to take you in. It is very likely that they will not be able to get in time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Good." Klein hesitated, still asked the exit, "Who pays the dues?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The initial dues I am responsible for, this It is a thank you for your efficiency. If you want to stay in the club, then the annual fee will be borne by you, about 15 pounds.” Mary’s eyes seemed to have a flame burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual fee is £15, and the initial membership fee is at least £50... High-end club... Ms. Mary, you are so generous! Klein immediately nodded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will give you the evidence as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, Klein went out again and continued to the "Brave Bar" in the Beckland Bridge area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to show their fear and helplessness in front of the military special department and the secret police. It seems that all the self-help methods want to try, II It is the middle sequencer of the "divination" approach under the ambassador. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involved in the fog, Klein believes that the gentleman or the lady must not be divined, including his own resurrection and past events, including the one with the help of The true Creator "created a successful "stained language" spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a powerful item that can definitely affect each other. Klein must keep himself insecure and madly grasp the state of various straws to mislead each other. , improve the odds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark weather, Klein entered the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still has a beer in the future, and he saw Casper, the old man with a rosace, standing in front of the "dog-catching mouse". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just that Maric is looking for you." Kaspers aimed at Klein and immediately limped over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maric is looking for me?" Klein asked recklessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously touched the Aziz copper whistle in his pocket and considered what excuses he should use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, to wrap the copper whistle with your own spirituality, will not cause the change of living corpses? Mr. Azick had not been to the cemetery before, nor did he see a body attacking him... Kline’s spirit was tense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before he even thought of an excuse, he saw his pale face as if he was hiding Malig from the other side, and there were no living bodies around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His living corpse? Klein was half confused and thought with a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric pointed to the card room. When he walked over, Klein looked far away and saw that there were no living bodies in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?" Klein asked first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric in a white shirt and black vest sits on the table and stares at Klein’s eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still have that commission?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Klein didn't respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a friend who recently lacks money and is willing to accept this commission. She is stronger than me and should be able to protect you. However, she only protects you for three days. The price is 1,000 pounds." Maric said vaguely and vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did I appear to be willing to accept the commission of the extraordinary person after I had the "dirty language"...but, this is better, more confusing the ambassador's side Extraordinary, when he tried his best to defeat Maric's friends, the probability of my success would become extremely high... The only question is how to make sure that Marich's friends are reliable... well, go to the fog and divination... ...Klein sinks for a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
