			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas street lights at night illuminate the wet ground, and sometimes a carriage drives past, splashing some water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland is located in the middle of the kingdom, only a few tens of kilometers from the Sea of ​​Sonia, with light rain all year round, the average maximum temperature in July is only 28 degrees Celsius, and the lowest in winter is At around 2 degrees Celsius, there is very little chance of falling to "zero point" or even breaking through, but this does not prevent people from feeling cold here. Even the North Foss people who are used to living in the snow and ice sometimes can't bear the kind of penetration. The clothes and flesh are damp and damp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stood in the unfired room, standing behind the convex window, looking out at the peaceful and quiet scene, only feeling body, mind, spirit Extremely easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the materials are assembled and the potions are blended, he can immediately advance to Sequence 6 and become a "no face". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 'Magician' pharmacy completely digested... 'Desire Apostle' was ended by me personally, unable to escape... 'Aurora' to 'fool' The search for believers is still on the road to death... Except for Mr. Azke’s question of which forces are being pursued and the problems related to the potion materials, I have no trouble for the time being...” Klein leaned forward and sighed and looked It condensed a layer of white mist on the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he is going to risk blocking the "desire apostle" is to worry that the other party has other arrangements, so as to get rid of the tracking of the official extraordinary, when The ones who provide the key opinions may be remembered and retaliated afterwards - as "cold-blooded", the devil is unlikely to risk revenge for his companions, but this does not mean that they will not choose to vent their anger because of their own death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This action really must, maybe the 'Twilight Hermitage' person has somewhere to meet, wait until the 'desire apostle' escapes, no corresponding I am just instructed by the sequence 5, and I think that it would not be too dangerous to promote the 'faceless man'. However, the 'desire apostle' is likely to use the information provided by the 'Abyss' brand and 'dusk The Hermit's help is promoted to a high sequence! This kind of development, just thinking about it makes people afraid... The knife of justice is indispensable...” Klein examines the things this afternoon, summing up the experience and lessons. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appreciating the night scene, he turned back to the sofa and sat down to think about the next arrangement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"With the bounty of the 'Mechanical Heart', the brain variability of the Thousand-faced Hunter and the blood can be bought, and the money needed for the hair of the Deep Sea Naga is enough. The sea should be easier to collect, and you can let the 'inverted people' help. The only problem is the characteristics of the human skin shadows.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And even if there are clues The Golden Pound is not enough..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it, Klein couldn’t help but laugh at himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I am not a person who is particularly interested in money. It is just a normal preference. At the time of Tingen, I have always encouraged Melissa to consume. I have been asking her and Banson to ask the maid. I feel that I should try not to treat myself anyway. Every time you do secret operations, it is also safety first, careful and important, and will not be influenced by wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But for revenge, the sequence must be upgraded, and the upgrade sequence must purchase expensive and extraordinary materials, which can only be saved by one penny and one sorrel. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly shrunk his shoulders, feeling that the coldness of the living room makes the "magician" who is not known for his physical quality tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he decided to take a bath directly, drill into the bed, and read books on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be three or four hours to go to sleep, there is no need to burn the fireplace again... Klein sighed and stood up and walked to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground area of ​​the steam church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons turned over all the confessions of the record, took the coffee, and took a sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calm for a few seconds, he took out the ancient silver mirror called Arrods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson glanced at it and asked curiously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deacon, if asked respect Does Arrods' mathematical unsolved puzzle or classic paradox give the correct answer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most of the time, it will be rejected directly. If it thinks you are malicious, it may even give you a lightning bolt directly, or let you bear the curse that you absolutely don't want to face." Icahn sighed. "It's a living seal." There is a very high intelligence, not a rigid machine that strictly follows the rules. When using it, it is best not to hold the idea of ​​drilling holes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson see Looking at the players around, I kindly proposed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Deacon, let me help you, I don't have anything to hide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He straightens his back and poses in a calm and honest manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikangsi bitterly laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No need, you know, I am no longer afraid of similar problems, and the distinguished Arrods occasionally asks quite esoteric questions. With your physical condition, the subsequent punishment is not so easy to bear."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, he first clenched his fist, then stretched out his fingers and stroked the silver mirror three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the subtle shackles, Iconslows the open voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Arod Sri Lanka, my question is, who is the "desire apostle" to assassinate the Duke of Nigan, or which power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver mirror has not changed for a short time, It took a while to float the water and outline a painting-like scene:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the plain where the sun is about to fall, and the vast fields are covered with pale gold. Afterglow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does this mean?" Carlson and other members of the "Mechanical Heart" look at me, I see you, completely incomprehensible, even if they have The extraordinary person who is promoted to the esoteric is no stranger to the interpretation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Twilight? The symbol of life going to the end? Is the sect of the god of death or the madman who believes in the end?" There is a "sneak peek" to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson echoes nod:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it is the latter."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons did not pay attention to their discussion, because the problem of Arrods has emerged:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the most What color panties do you like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iconser’s face suddenly turned red, only to feel like smoking in the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spit out a very difficult word:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room suddenly became very quiet, and Carlson and others looked at the corner without incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons sat down in a vain manner, grabbed the fluffy hair, and was ready to ask the second question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson couldn’t bear to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deacon, let me give it a try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Try not to enter the penalty section." ICONSER finally nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlson confidently imitated the deacon's movements, stroking the silver mirror surface three times, and other members re-enclosed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Arodus, my question is, what are the partners of the 'Desire Apostles'?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water floats, the image changes, the silver mirror surface first presents a woman's back, and the figure is excellent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it is a person who is vague to the extreme, can only barely judge from the dress is a man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still a collaborator, this should be the person who sold the information of the Duke of Nigan! Unfortunately, the other party has to do some processing..." Carlson looked around A circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that he has no secrets to sue, and he does not need to care about subsequent questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the choices that Arrods gives are problems, tasks or punishments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson does not hesitate to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Question!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver mirror surface quickly outlines a bloody word:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you solve it by your hand every day?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlson’s lips twitched and he felt his ears quickly become hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something he thinks is normal, but in the face of so many teammates and bosses, he still has a way to bury his face. The impulse on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." He replied very quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the Church of St. Seychelles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily with blue eyeshadow threw a stack of papers in front of Soul Soul:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the information you need about Tarot cards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Less than I thought." Soest slightly surprised. Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delly snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just an index."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard saw the lower lip with the right palm of the red glove:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain Soest Why don't we delve into the people who have contacted Jason Beria and compare them with the previous two cases? It is likely that there is a clue to the organization symbolizing the tarot card."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Duke of Nigan is the devotee of the Lord of the Storm, representing the interests of the storm church in politics. The punishers will definitely find the murderer madly, we don't have to Blending, it is easy to contradict them, we check other cases involving Tarot cards, maybe we will find new clues, of course, we will certainly run around, but this is the duty of the red gloves. Ster smiled and explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in his mind, the slightly old voice is ridiculous: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The night is like this Missed, that person has the taste of 'black emperor', the true 'black emperor' taste!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Holy Spirit Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Singer of God" wearing a black soft hat, Ace Sneek, swept away, and said to the selected cadres of the punishers: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I am about to leave Beckland, this is the decision of the Cardinal Conference.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There is only one of your next tasks, that is, to investigate the assassination of the Duke of Nigan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After declaration, you have the right to use Level 1 seals and you must figure out who is targeting us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the forefront, a middle-aged man wearing a modified captain’s cap immediately led the crowd, clenching his fists and tapping his chest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Follow, Cardinal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is lean and looks like nothing, but has an anchor-shaped black-and-black tattoo on his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens, a luxury villa in the Earl of Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey looked at Su Shi who came in and opened the door, pressing down the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
