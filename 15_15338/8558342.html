			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the "hidden" answer, "Justice" Audrey added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you think this information is important and you can't make free communication, I can pay a certain amount of compensation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, as long as you know the land of Fenetport The goddess church people can understand this situation." "The hidden person" Jia Delia does not doubt the sincerity of the "just" exchange of equals, I believe that the other party has sufficient financial resources or resources to meet its own offer price. But she still decided to disclose some information for free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to promote the "Justice" Miss's goodwill towards himself, to lay the foundation for the possible future transactions, and to observe the Tarot congregation through the throwing of intelligence. Members responded by speculating on their position in their own organization and power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also familiar with the leader of the Mother Earth, Utravsky, who is not familiar with the situation... Of course, I am really afraid He is too oppressive in height and size. Every time he tries to find only Emlin White. The "stupid" Klein, who is the top of the bronze long table, laughs at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "hidden" Jia Delia did not stop, said by himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Vampire 'Belongs to the 'moon' route, the corresponding sequence 9 is 'pharmacist', sequence 8 is 'tamer', sequence 6 is 'potion professor', sequence 5 is 'deep red scholar', sequence 4 is 'witch king' Going up, I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough." Emlin White woke, "Misser", I must Emphasize that it is a blood family, not a vampire. Hehe, if you call a human being who is a traitor to get the characteristics of my family, I don't object, even agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original "vampire" is the "pharmacist" approach, and the "Witch King" is also, no wonder they will worship the "primitive moon", do not believe in the goddess...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The seal that Miss Sharon got, "Crimson Moonlight", is it that the "deep red scholar" or the blood clan has evolved? In addition to its ability to create a full moon effect, immune effects, it can also provide terrible speed, unimaginable resilience and more powerful dark spells. Negative effects can be solved by sucking human blood... It is very like blood. Derived...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, among the various professions, some are like "divination", there is no connection before and after, and some have certain progress, very It’s weird...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has been together in the past, some stunned and somewhat confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger and "Magic" Firth and others who are thoughtful, or listened to with gusto, or pretend not interested, each The reactions are all different, but the "hidden" Jia De Li Ya can judge according to this, they did not know anything about the "vampire" related information:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are The status of their respective organizations and forces is still in the middle and lower levels, in line with the fact that it is not long before being pulled into the Tarot, and is in the characteristics of a fast promotion channel... The 'world' has not responded, or it is very deep, or has long known the 'vampire' Things, either or both... After this observation, you must admit that the 'world' is the most noteworthy and most watched member of the Tarot Club..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Justice" Audrey has a strong interest in listening and thinking about it, just like a small tutoring course:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Ms. 'Hidden', why is there no need to contact each sequence between the 'moon' pathways? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hidden” Jia Delia looked at “Justice” and found that her dress and jewelry were completely different from the previous one, without any repetition, but They all reflect the luxury and temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the daytime, she seems to have seen the portrait of the Queen when she was young. Every dress on the top is not the same. The same clothes are in formal occasions. Will not wear a second time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cardella is silent: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Different sequences within a route do not have to There are associations, or there must be surface associations. Their common feature is that they are in the realm of this path corresponding to the gods. For example, 'the moon' represents spirituality, plants, beauty, part of life, part of darkness and part of it. So this route has pharmacists in the field of plants, vampires in the realm of life, and animal trainers with life and spirituality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood!" "Moon" Emlin White emphasized one sentence and slightly lifted his chin. "This should be the reason why our blood races are very handsome and beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; No, it is not like this. The vampires I have seen are very disgusting... "The Sun" Dairik whispered in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you explain this? It’s not the same as the captain and Dai Li’s statement... The different ways represent the fields that the different sequence 0 contains... Or, the two statements are combined to be the most accurate answer? I don't know what field the sequence of the "Divination" route will represent. From the symbolic pattern behind my chair, we are surprised and changed. Klein’s face was quiet, but his heart was sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey easily understands the explanation of Ms. "Hidden" and can't help guessing the name of its own route sequence 0:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Definitely not a 'dragon', there are many types of dragons, and a lot of abilities are not included in this route, which is closer to the field represented by the 'spiritual dragon' ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really hope that Mr. Fool's will collect the cards corresponding to this route as soon as possible...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The "Grossel Travels" comes from the dragon family, I don't know if it has anything to do with the "spiritual dragon"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, "Moon" Emlin confirmed: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, I want to be a Viscount of the blood family, and I have to play the role of Professor Potions. ', even if it is the darling of the 'moon'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White classmate, I know what you want to emphasize is the latter half... "Folly" Clay Grace points out his right hand and pinches his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the reasons why he commissioned Miss Magic to go to Williams Street to see the anomaly. He always felt that Emlin White did not The vampire who loves to go out and not socialize is not too reliable. Another reason is that he knows that the other party must be secretly monitored by the bloodline high-level, let him go to Williams Street, it is easy to expose the underground remains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." "The Hidden" Jia Delia made a point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication continues, and gradually comes to an end, "Justice" Audrey seems to think of something, sideways, looking to the bronze long table first: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. 'Footer', the second round of the unified examination of government employees officially ended today, leaving only the final interview."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a soft tone and a clear delight, just like an excellent student who reports her grades to parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her view, the government employee unified examination program is a "fool" Mr. casually give advice, he through the humble guidance, and strive to promote matters, is her Attempts to change reality with extraordinary ability, so I have been very concerned, and from time to time report to the proponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second round of exams is over? I don't know if Benson can pass, and I have no chance to enter the final interview... Klein leaned against the back of the chair and suddenly felt emotional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently daggers, with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "justice" that Mr. "fool" admired, Audrey became more and more happy, feeling that he indirectly changed the fate of many people, so that they could only be in the lower middle of society. They have the opportunity to enter the upper middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "hidden" Jia Delia listened to this exchange, could not help but frown, feeling that this is not the same style that Tarot will show before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the transformation of the Lun Kingdom in the last six months is implicitly promoted by Tarot? The lady of justice, the aristocratic girl, played an important role? If so, I have to adjust my cognition again... Although the members here are not high in sequence, the status in the organization is not high, but it can affect the world situation to some extent?" Jia Delia retracted her eyes and considered whether to pass Different channels have a deep understanding of the behind-the-scenes story of Lun’s transformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another few minutes of communication, "The Fool" Klein announced that the party ended here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the greetings of Miss Justice and others, he cut off the contact, leaned back on the back of the chair, and quietly looked at the boundless gray mist below. I have been watching for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
