			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After signing the contract with Miller Carter and charging a prepayment of £10, Klein was not in a hurry to go to Williams Street, but to an afternoon. Four o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, Miller understands very well that, in his opinion, the single-handed Charlotte Moriarty detective must recruit personnel to explore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old-school gentleman left, Klein immediately returned to the table and cut the cold-cut steak into his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Really, he doesn’t have to eat lunch? I have to pick this time to go to the door... I barely fill my stomach, and Klein is beginning to clean up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At two o'clock in the afternoon, Mrs. Mary came to visit as scheduled, her eyes were slightly red and swollen, but her face became more and more gloomy, accompanied by her Stalin. Have to keep silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein handed over the carefully selected photo in an envelope:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms., you confirm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary was dull for two seconds, slowly took a breath, took the envelope, took the photo, and examined it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...very good, very good, you are the most efficient and responsible detective I have ever seen, I am honored to introduce you to the Craig Club The members... This is the last £7, which is what you deserve.” Mary pulled out a wallet from the leather handbag and counted a five-pound two-pound note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she did not wait for Klein to respond, stuffed the photo into an envelope, put it in her handbag, and suddenly got up and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬, her buttonless leather boots stepped out of a rushing voice, and Starling Summerr struggled to catch up before she barely managed to follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I opened the door, Mary suddenly stunned and almost fell. Fortunately, Starling just helped her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this episode, Mary apparently slowed down the movement and seemed to have become quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms., you forgot to take a portable camera...I will give Mrs. Summer to her, let her bring it to you... Klein looks at it like this. The scene, shaking his head slightly, said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the second floor, took a nap, and woke up comfortably in the percussive sound of the nearby church bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has previously turned the map to confirm that Williams Street is at the junction of the West End and Queens, which is the core of Beckland and suitable for living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of a good house in the West End and Hillston area is around £2,500. Miller Carter’s home is close to Queens and is the former Viscount’s estate. The area is definitely not small, the overall purchase of at least more than 3,500 pounds, or even up to 5,000 pounds, which can change a very good magical item ... he came to visit me, did not bring a housekeeper, no attendants, because the beginning To Beckland, all aspects have not yet been on the right track? Klein put on a double-breasted long dress, put on a hat, lifted his cane, and went out to Minsk Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the gas street light has not been lit, the street is actually more gloomy than in the evening, but the air is OK, there are no areas in the east side of the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rental carriage, all the way to Williams Street, Klein saw the waiting man outside the house on the 8th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This servant wears red vest light trousers and respectfully treats the guests:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Good afternoon, is it Moriatti detective?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I have an appointment with Mr. Carter." Klein gently daggers Followed by the servant and entered the mansion with a garden on the lawn side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This house has two floors, the first floor is quite messy, with lots of building materials, and workers are doing renovations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller Carter did not wear a hat, covered his nose and greeted him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I am very sorry, it is too messy and dirty, but I hope that before my family arrives in Beckland, everything can be beautiful and can only be urged to keep working."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he looked at the manservant and gave a cry:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You continue to look at them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp It’s no wonder that without a servant before, the servants have become supervised... Klein smiled and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know a lot of doctors, they told me, just The converted house is not suitable for immediate occupancy. At least three months of ventilation is required. Otherwise, the elderly and children who are not strong enough are likely to get sick."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?? Miller led Klein to the basement and asked questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't verified it, but I chose to believe in authority. It is said that this stems from the words handed down by Russell the Great." Klein casually wrote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miller nodded and turned back to look at the door, couldn’t help but frown and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mr. Detective, you didn't bring an assistant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There may be no danger in the building."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have an assistant, but you can't see it... Klein's belly, a true color says:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the first time Exploring, I will move forward very cautiously, and any problems will immediately retreat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this regard, I have a wealth of experience and will not put myself in danger. In the situation, and the lack of skilled assistants, it is easy to make my actions less flexible and less decisive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller screamed:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very professional."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Fudge... Klein silently added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller no longer doubts, leads Moriatti detective, walks through the messy living room, along the steps down, into a rather spacious basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no gas pipe here, but there are four metal candlesticks on the wall, and the dim light is swaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the slate of the ground, Klein couldn’t help but feel a sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a noble property, even the basement is "renovated", and it is almost as big as the living room of my current house...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Miller pointed At the forefront: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a secret door there, which was discovered when the workers were transformed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Klein stared at it, with a light candlelight, and saw a gray-white stone door in the corner, which should have been integral with the wall, but now it is exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next step is for you, pay attention to safety." Old-school gentleman Miller gave Klein a glimpse of the lit lantern and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pre-passing the wind?" Klein cautiously asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller is invisible and shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The inside is not particularly dull, but I Didn't let the workers go too far."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein checked the belongings and put on a black glove in Miller's gaze. The lantern was lifted unhurriedly, close to the stone door, and pushed with a cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the slightly heavy zha, he followed the light and saw a ramp with dark slate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several wooden doors on the sides and at the end of the ramp. They have been shown to be rotten, but they are barely usable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too old...but the exaggerated style of the door and the depth and depth of the slate are not too ambiguous... Was the former Viscount family replaced? Klein quietly turned on the vision, clenched his cane, carrying the lantern, step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light dispels the darkness. When passing through the rooms on both sides, because the workers hired by Miller have not explored in depth, he can see through the open door. The empty scene, see the bench table that is quite consistent with the style of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing flashes... Klein took a look at it and continued to move forward without stopping. He came to the end of the black stone door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extending the gloved right palm, he half-sticked his cane, slowly pushing hard to push the threshold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squeaky friction of the teeth began to reverberate, and Shimen gradually cracked into a gap. Klein’s eyes suddenly appeared a little aura, reflecting the numerous entanglements Field color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was tight in his heart and suddenly pushed the door and then stepped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap in Shimen quickly expanded, and a black, slippery creature suddenly fell from the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a long snake with a triangular head and a red pattern! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It straightens up the upper body, spits the core, and looks at Klein with the cold brown eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, one after another, the snake fell from the door and piled up at the entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over them, Klein saw that there was a hall inside, and there were countless snakes of various colors in the center of the hall squirming and forming a group of ten meters. The long and wide exaggerated snake's nest, the feeling of slippery nausea rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s scalp suddenly became numb, and he couldn’t help but retreat two steps. He even wanted to remove his eyes and dare not look straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is a man, he is still afraid of snakes, and the most feared animal is a snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stems from a psychological shadow of him. When he was a child, he should have slept and pushed the door of the room through the gap. Enjoy watching movies with your parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, his parents once saw a snake disaster film. There was a scene in which the building was demolished. As a result, a large nest of snakes was dug up. The peristalsis is still deeply remembered in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you influence so many snakes with the "Sleep Charm"? Klein swallowed hard and said to the air:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The figure of the bodyguard wearing a black gothic dress quickly appeared on his side, his mouth tight, nothing said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at her, and she looked at Klein and no one spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a snake slowly walked out, Klein finally coughed and repeated again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What do you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguard did not answer, floated up, and the cold wind blew in the ramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is stirring, blowing into the hall, the temperature here is falling rapidly, close to the outside world<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dense snake in the center of the hall suddenly spread out and swam in all directions, looking for a place that is warmer and more suitable for survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two or three minutes, the surface of the hall and the ramp had a thin frost, and the countless snakes had nowhere to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind has not stopped, Klein shudders:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor, almost. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind slowed down, but the feeling of coldness did not weaken, and the figure of the bodyguard disappeared into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein lifted the right palm of the cane, covered his mouth and nose, sneezed, then raised the lantern, carefully crossed the stone door, and entered the wide Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style here is consistent with the outside martyrdom, with dark black slate dominated by eight columns of the same color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
