			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed Sac. Augustus Prince? Will he be associated with something dangerous that could lead to a tragedy? Moreover, this thing seems to have been the attention of Mr. "fool"! "Justice" Audrey instantly matched the name with the characters and caused great anxiety and doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her cognition, things that can be watched by Mr. "The Fool" are either very dangerous, or extremely secretive, or far-reaching, and will never be simple, such as The "real creator" tried to take advantage of the bad conditions of Llanus and the Eastern District factory area to come to Beckland, such as the "Black Emperor" card of Russell the Great, such as the death of the Duke of Nigan and the "Twilight Hermit." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In analogy with these examples, Audrey has every reason to believe that if it is not handled well, or not paid enough attention, it will involve the prince Edsac. Great events will inevitably bring about a very, very terrifying "storm"!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔... Prince Edsac has not been entangled with me for a long time, I Just fortunately, I didn't think much. Now it seems that this seems a bit problem... In front of the dance, I also enthusiastically stopped me to talk about some boring topics, playing with the self-righteous humiliation, just two or three days later, I became Quite cold, even deliberately avoiding me... I must find I will ask my father about his affairs, but he can't be too curious, otherwise he will probably agree to the royal family's marriage requirements... Audrey recalled some details, and suddenly felt his shoulders become heavy. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- She has never liked Prince Edsac, including his two brothers, never thought about becoming a king, as for the reason, very simple The believers of the "Goddess of the Night" cannot accept the Augustus who believe in the "master of the storm" from generation to generation. That means that the arrogance, arrogance, contempt and partiality of women have penetrated into each other's bone marrow, and it is difficult to do it again. Change, and this is the most intolerable thing for Audrey.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking of becoming a king, you will be in an ancient, extremely conservative environment, Li felt that she would definitely go crazy and flee in desperation. Therefore, when the princes were still diligently pleased, she was not touched or even rejected.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Edsac Augustus ...Listing to the surname is a member of the royal family. I vaguely remember that this is a prince? What dangerous things do he have to do? I can’t reach him at all... Yes, you can ask Miss Audrey and Viscount Glenlint. Help, but the reason is to think ahead, can't make them doubt... "Magic" Firth frowned and interpret the words of "Foolish Man".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Alger was very interested in this, but he did not dare to ask the "fool" who was obviously only prompted, and had to indulge for two seconds, for "justice", "magic" and "world" Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The atmosphere above the sea is not calm, which may have been linked to Beckland, just like those machines. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is unfounded in this sentence, purely trying to exaggerate the danger and let the three members of the Tarot Club in Beckland actively investigate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......has to say that the "inverted man" is very well matched... On the sidelines, Klein gave up the intention to let the "world" say something like words. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only reason he mentions Prince Edsack, not the lady who wears a sapphire ring, who is suspected of having a “0” seal, does not "0-08" and Inz. Zangweier blended into this matter because they don't understand the situation that even destroys a country's top seals. They can only make it by some subtle clues. I’m completely sure of the speculation that I’m afraid to tell the “Justice” and the “Magician” directly to the key points, and they will be spotted by the targeted investigation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This is why Klein does not find the opportunity to inform himself of the "mechanical heart", based on the seal "0-08" Some speculations, he suspects that when he leaves Minsk Street with his thoughts and arrives at the lever church or the steam church by horse-drawn carriage, he will encounter sudden and unmatchable attacks, such as the riots in the underground area, such as high The fatal blow of the strong sequence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the shielding of the fog can make Klein not have to worry about similar problems, and can inform the government to some extent. "Justice" and "Magician", through them, are softer and more devious, and will not be reminded by pre-discovery.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than that, Klein There are other plans, that is, the supporting role in the supporting role fades out of the stage, "after leaving" Beckland, change the appearance without any attention, quietly return, contact the "machinery" outside the line of sight of the "0" seal Heart"!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed his eyes and flashed out the bright boots and pale palms in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned back on the back of his chair and raised his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ladies and gentlemen, We will see you next week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens, the Earl of Hall Luxury villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey stood in front of the full-length mirror and looked at the self inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Tarot party has good news and bad news for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good news is that she is about to get one of the main materials for the "psychologist" potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she is not the ignorant girl who bought some basic common sense from the "downside down" with 1,000 pounds, knowing the approximate price of many extraordinary materials, But she does not mind paying a premium for Jing Long's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the assassination of the Duke of Nigan, she had the desire and motivation to urgently improve her sequence and gain the corresponding strength. For this reason, she did not want to wait any longer. Pay a certain price - as long as there is material, as long as it is not too outrageous, she will accept it immediately, so as not to be disturbed by accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a precious jewel that is seen by many aristocratic ladies, and rare horses with a favorite blood and a man’s preference. The corresponding premium is inevitable. Inevitably, sometimes it is impossible to double or triple the original price... Moreover, Fols is busy in the middle, contact the teacher, and certainly can’t let her waste time and take risks, hehe... she I don't know if I am "justice"... Audrey thought without thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the bad news, there is no doubt that Prince Edessac’s business has made Audrey’s rare worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Mr. "World" got the news, and Mr. "The Fool" gave a reminder, otherwise things don't know what will get worse... Audrey, with With such good conditions, you can definitely solve this problem! Come on! The girl painted a blushing moon against the people in the mirror and tried to make herself optimistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, she convinced her emotions and went out to the piano room to prepare for the next piano lesson, just like nothing happened,<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because the Earl of Hall and Hibbert Halle can only go home before dinner. She now wants to inquire about the news and has no object. She can only tell herself that she should calm down and Calm, be patient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the family teacher arrived, Audrey played the music casually and washed the mind with a beautiful melody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing came to an end, she found that Jin Mao’s big dog Su Shi did not know when he had opened the door, and he was next to him, and the jewelry-like Phnom Penh was still hanging around his neck. glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Audrey, what problem have you encountered? Your voice tells me that you have troubles." Susie said openly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔...Audrey grabbed it and didn’t know what to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly felt that having a "reading a dog" at home is not necessarily a good thing...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... .........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the camp burning the campfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick Berg, with his eyes closed, quietly recalled what happened at the Tarot party and confirmed that he had not forgotten the memories of the same life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, and he looked forward to seeing him open his eyes and look around. However, it’s the flames and teammates that are exactly the same as the memories. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, sitting cross-legged, leaning against the stone pillar "The Demon Hunter" Colin screamed:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After 50 lightning strikes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
