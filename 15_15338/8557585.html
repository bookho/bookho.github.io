			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just sorted out his thoughts, and Elland caught up with the two and smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Find the target, the investigation is over, I will send you back to the hotel, wait two days to bring the reward, and, today, it is best not to go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Klein maintains the attitude of Gilman Sparo, only gently tapped his head and did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way back to the "Azure Wind" hotel, Daniz apparently had doubts or sighs to express, but due to the presence of the military officer Ellan, Only the topic can be transferred, and it is interesting to discuss what pirates will be arrested in this city survey today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, those guys who are not part of the "Golden Dreams" are not friends and are not worthy of sympathy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the hotel room and watching Allan leave, he closed the door and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The Book of Natural Disasters... The Relics of Ancient Elves... This is really an interesting thing, but how do the elves become like demons? Just take their books and flip them over, the woman is crazy, Out of control!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the image of the elf in your mind? Active in the mountains and seas, good at cooking, like natural creatures? Oh, according to the small "sun", the eight ancient gods before the Cataclysm were very violent, very cruel, very evil, including the Elf King Sonia Sorem, and believed in Him, and he The elves of the king, the great probability will not be good, where you can refer to the members of the "Aurora"... The extraordinary races left by the Dark Ages are basically not associated with the "good" in the concept of normal people... Klein answered two sentences in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he does not rule out that the ancient gods are falling behind, and the dragons, giants, elves, blood races and other creatures gradually get rid of the negative effects and eventually become more normal. But this will only be limited to the middle and lower levels, not including those who are semi-god-level, and the upper elf who left the book of Scourge is obviously the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Klein suddenly noticed one thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz knows the elves Text! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recognized the name of the ancient book of sheepskin is "The Book of Natural Disasters"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Iceberg Lieutenant" has educated the crew to such an extent, not only popularizing the ancient Fossic, but also teaching the Elvish that can incite the forces of nature. ...... Maybe the Giants and Ancient Hermes are also in the course of the "Golden Dreams"... It’s really a group of pirates with knowledge and dreams, but Madame Captain, are you too biased, Daniz is In many ways, he did not pass the test... Also, the pirate whose main post is the treasure hunter, the most important thing is to master the ancient language... Klein ignored the sigh of Daniz and turned his eyes to the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the sky is still a bit gloomy, it seems that the rain will drop at any time, people feel involuntarily depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein can't see the dagger, think a little relaxed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found the pull Ticia, who knows the remains of the ancient elves on the island of Symi, the storm church and the kingdom military should soon be able to use the link between the remains and the Caviteva hideout to find this increasingly crazy 'Poseidon'. Or use the ruins to speed up its collapse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this way, except for the most fanatical and devout 'Poseidon' believers will die, others will not receive What hurts..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein originally thought of using the method of positioning the spirit world, behind the "Poseidon" Kavitova, the official extraordinary found it to hide Before going there, sneak into it and go down the treasure, but this plan has not yet begun, it seems that the "Book of Natural Disasters" is on the verge of failure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call... Nothing, only in the imagination, never belonging to your own, no, no... I don’t even know what to harvest. ...this is the best solution to this problem... Klein took back the sight of the weather, calmed and relaxed, only slightly inevitable.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This One day, he and Daniz followed Ellan’s suggestion and did not go out, only in the hotel<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Klein got up on time and found that the clouds were stacked in the air, and the sky was still dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that the confrontation of the Cardinal of the Church of the Storm, the senior deacon of "the punitive", Yann Courtman, and the "Poseidon" Cavitowa are still going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein felt the pain in his lower abdomen and prepared to take a newspaper to the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can look at the white bread, lying in the easy chair, and leisurely reading the newspaper Daniz, he gave up the plan again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When sitting on the toilet, reading the newspaper does not meet the requirements of the German Sparrow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this would be boring, but the play can’t relax... Hey, he found a difference between the true self and the disguised identity in the choice of behavior... Klein silent Doing a summary, went into the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pull off the trousers and sit on the toilet. He looked at the shallow white wall in front of him, almost as if he wanted to read the text from above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, his inspiration suddenly triggered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is busy moving his teeth and turning on the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thick, tall white bones appear in front of him, the messenger's legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger stood there, his head out of the ceiling, but the dark flame in the eye socket was still visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a low head and looks down on Klein sitting on the toilet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked up and stunned for two seconds, and all the thoughts turned around in his head were inexplicable thoughts:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;I should be like a lady, hurriedly cover the lower body, still frank, fearless...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he made the decision, the messenger lost The next letter, the brush disintegrated into white bones, falling like a rainstorm, disappearing into the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stayed in touch with Mr. Azick’s reply, and it took a while to react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This messenger is getting more and more impolite! Didn't see me going to the toilet? I don't know if I knock on the door first, or stuff it in from the gap below the door! Klein sighed with anger and laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about it, he felt that it was difficult to believe that the letter from the gap at the bottom of the door was too messy, and that the height of nearly four meters could be reached. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture is quite funny when I think about it... Well, when I write the next time, there is more content, so that Mr. Azke can educate the messenger. Let it know how to be polite... Klein unfolds the letter and reads Azick's reply:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...According to the knowledge I can recall, I can provide two One way, the first method must have sufficient preconditions, that is, you or someone else's own items in the 'Poseidon' Cavi Tuva, which can be easily positioned by divination... Another premise is that you can Entering the spiritual world, I have enough skills in this area. The three commonly used ones are listed below...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second way is to use the 'fine ceremony' Pray to 'Red Light' Al Moria, who represents power and will, and to some extent holds knowledge related to spiritual creatures and spiritual places..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original "red light" of one of the seven clean lights is called Al Moria... The principle of the ritual is to adjust Self-state, let go of mind and body, let yourself and pray for a little bit of agreement, and finally partially overlap, and harvest the corresponding knowledge, and this kind of fit and overlap is relative. When I gain knowledge, my secret is also open to praying goals. ... I can't trust "red light"... I have too many secrets... Kline's first reaction ruled out the second method.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the first one, and the lack of success, Klein does not have a separate item in the hiding place of "Poseidon" Cavitewa.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a look at the spirit and repeated it several times, thinking that there is a certain probability of success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the toilet was finished, Klein cleaned his hands and immediately stepped back four steps to the fog, and divination on the attempt he wanted to do. Get inspirations that are dangerous but can be tolerated as long as they are handled properly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he went back to the living room and walked to the easy chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz sat up and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know the prayers corresponding to 'Poseidon'?" Klein asked without undulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz spread his hand and suddenly snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shit..." He whispered his arm and said with a smile. "Know, I have seen several rebellious ceremonies,... ...specifically, 'the leader of the sea and the spiritual world, the protector of the Rothde Islands, the dominator of the sea creatures, the master of the tsunami and the storm, the great Cavitowa', right, the effect is twice Elf language."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the sea and the spirit...the gesture is very low...there is a fundamental difference between my name and my name...also I copied the seven true gods... Klein nodded lightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know where there are no warehouses, abandoned houses?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course! Every big pirate has mastered some." Daniz responded without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately turned and walked to the coat rack:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What to do? Although Daniz was puzzled, he did not dare to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dock area, in a dirty and dilapidated warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz looked at German Sparrow to take out three candles and multiple metal bottles, and finally couldn’t help but curious, and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, what do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not look back and replied very calmly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the sacrifice?" Daniz is interested Asked the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein arranged the altar and took out an iron cigarette case with a plain tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Cavi Tuva."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way he wants to locate is to send things directly to "Poseidon" Cavitewa! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as Cavitowan accepts, he can use his divination and other means to find the other's hiding place! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether or not Cavi Tuva will receive the problem, he certainly has considered it and believes that there is a certain possibility because of the current state of Cavitowan. It is dying, very crazy, basically not sensible, acting only by instinct, and it may have a strong desire for fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Klein is preparing to sacrifice an iron cigarette case that is often placed on the fog, and try to check if Cavitowa will receive it. He will not have any loss, so there is no such thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacrifice to "Poseidon" Caviteu? At this moment, Daniz felt that his head was not enough, and he could not understand the idea of ​​German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you crazy? How can it accept your sacrifice? Even if it is accepted, what is the point? It is dying! And it is dangerous. Danis asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
