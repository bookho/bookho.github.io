When Jia De Li Ya looked back, he found the reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not surprised by this, even thinks that this is in line with the madness of German Sparrow - decent clothes only prepare one set, the rest Money is spent on magical objects, extraordinary weapons, spiritual charms, and everything is based on the improvement of its own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder the king of immortality" later gave up, he just attacked the passing ship, there was not enough hatred to drive him all the way... Well, senior pirate The generals still have some hope of escaping in front of the 'four kings'...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s almost here...hey, I haven’t completely digested it... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, yesterday, the crazy adventurer, German Sparrow, seemed to be very successful. The crew of the 'Future' gave a very positive and very enthusiastic Responding, in two or three days, you should be able to completely digest, and even if you enter a dangerous sea area, it is not so easy to find a mermaid. "Klein nodded and suppressed the impulse of the inquiry, ready to cross the star. Take the breakfast at the fixed long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he saw a pirate rushing in with a lively cyan fish and heading straight to the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position sits pale and transparent, and the nose is quite uncoordinated, the "Future" second, Heath Doyle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-meter-long sea fish was placed in front of the "bloodless". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heath Doyle stretched out his hands, held the big fish, his body bent a little, his head hangs down, his face sticks to the scales, like kissing . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, the fish is stiff, and then like a candle to meet the flame, melt quickly, become a disgusting flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh and blood is like a liquid, pouring into the mouth of Heath Doyle, covering the outer layer of his skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the squirming that can’t be seen directly, the big fish and the bones all disappeared with flesh and blood, leaving no trace, Heath Doyle’s face It became very clean, but the lips were bright red, like a blooming rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Bishop... Klein’s mind came up with the name of the sequence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cardella standing next to him also saw this scene, pushing the glasses:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Every Rose Bishop needs to add enough flesh and blood to fully exploit his extraordinary abilities, and it is not easy to get out of control after a wounded battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She has a slight tick in her mouth and added one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just the 'Aurora" madmen are more inclined to human flesh and blood, in fact, can be replaced by something else. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the "bloodless" of the bounty of 7,600 pounds is indeed very lucky, because the accidental moment reached the sequence 6 but there is no change, no aberration is a On the other hand, the pirate group that joins the "Stars above" is on the other hand. Without the secret knowledge possessed by the woman chased by knowledge, even if he does not actively listen to the voice of the "real creator," sooner or later he will be eager. Human flesh and blood turned into a 'monster'... Klein secretly felt. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He increasingly feels that the "secret person" approach, that is, the "shepherd" approach is the easiest way to get out of control and the most vulnerable, no one, Even if it represents Zhang Yang’s malicious "abyss" approach, it will be a bit worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein retracted his gaze, just about to take a step, the entire ship suddenly violently ups and downs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, Klein’s mind naturally emerged from the scene in front of the “Future”: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue sea was cut by huge gaps here, endless sea water Like a waterfall, rushing down vertically into the bottomless darkness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene is magnificent, and people are sincerely skeptical about where they are or not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Future" can't stop, rushing out of the edge and falling quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirates in the restaurant all flew up and bumped into the ceiling above, grilled toast, white bread, butter, butter, beer, fried fish and other foods. It’s so busy that it’s too late to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein also lost balance and struggled to go straight to the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out in the palm of his hand, pressed up and performed acrobatics and quickly adjusted his posture, making himself look awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, Nina showed an amazing balance, with the help of the ceiling, maintaining her posture, and knowingly or unintentionally stretched her legs, it happened. Playing in Frank, let the "toxin expert" fly out obliquely, crashed into the barrel and was covered with pale yellow liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the easiest and most pleasant thing is the "star above the" Jia Delia, her body around the stars, the feet under the shape, the whole person floating in the air , without any impact from the crash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides her, it is a "bloodless" Heath is the least wandering, this "Rose Bishop" does not know when it has been integrated into the shadows, disappeared . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the "Future" will completely fall into the dark gap where the bottom is not visible, and suddenly there will be a fountain-like sea water rushing up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It holds the boat, throws it high and throws it to the other side of the section. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a feeling of lightness, Klein believes that the "Future" has settled steadily on the surface of the sea, which makes his right hand clasped the "Poseidon" field spells Did not come in handy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sunlight outside the window became bright and blazed in, and the restaurant was unusually messy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein, who had already recovered his balance, walked to the window and saw that the boundless ocean outside seemed to be burning with a golden flame, and seemed to be at noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just early in the morning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein raised his head and squinted his eyes, only to see the sun in direct sunlight, no clouds, no sun, no golden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder the mirror of Arrodes is a non-real ocean, belonging to the legacy of the war of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the eyes swept over, he found a ruin not far from the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of the ruins are submerged by the sea, beyond the plane are the gray stones and stone pillars stacked in a peak, the top has a dome-like thing, it depends on itself The curvature of the arc has propped up a lot of space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ruin was definitely huge. Klein saw through the transparent seawater that it had spread to the bottom of the sea and there was no end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a very dangerous ocean." "The star above" Jia Delia did not know when it was coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein crossed his head and looked over, waiting for Ms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddriad looked at the front and said with a slight exclamation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am here Not many times, and it was a long time ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I", not "we"...that is, not at the time and "future" When this group of people came together...when it was the "mysterious queen"? Klein was keenly aware of the problem of the word "above the stars" and there was a vague guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
