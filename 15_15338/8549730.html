			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pour the coffee, go back to the arsenal and take a thick stack of historical materials and old drafts, and Klein walks along the wall. The gas lamp turned to the ladder leading to the Black Thorns Security Company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒,哒,哒, footsteps echo in the sealed and empty ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walked through the winding staircase, pushed the door open, and identified it, heading straight to the second office opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days of familiarity, he has roughly figured out the layout of the Blackthorn Security Company:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Just getting started is a spacious reception hall, with a set of sofas, tables and chairs, through the partition, is the inner area, the three rooms on the left side of the corridor are near and far from the accounting room of Mrs. Oliana, and there are a few A lounge with a sofa bed and a staircase leading to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three rooms on the right are from the office of Captain Dunn Smith, the office of the civilian staff who have typewriters, and the official members of the Night Club. Recreation Room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had seen Leonard Mitchell play cards in the recreation room with two other team members. He guessed it was the landlord, of course, Rose. The Great has renamed it, called "The Fighting Evil", but there is no difference between the gameplay and Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright value will have a day of sleep benefits after the night, Roshan stayed at the reception desk, responsible for purchasing, claiming supplies and part-time coachman's Cesare Francis went out as usual, and when Klein pushed the door of the civilian office, all three tables were empty, and the mechanical typewriter was quietly placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Axon's Type 1346 typewriter..." Klein whispered something similar in the mentor's office and Welch's house, only to see that The looming complex control system is full of mechanical beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the desk with a typewriter and sat down for a while, trying to type virtual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, he always instinctively processed into pinyin, and when he was familiar, he "digested" the corresponding memory fragments of the original, no longer wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒,哒,哒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rhythmical keyboard knocking sounds like a piece of hard music from metal and industry. With this melody, Klein quickly got it. Documents for applying for funding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was not in a hurry to find Dunn Smith, but he converges and carefully reads the historical materials provided by Daniel, both reviewing and learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near noon, he moved his neck and put away the information. According to the draft of the "mystery course", he reconciled the content of the morning study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, he took the "application" and went to the office next door, gently ringing the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den is waiting for the delivery of lunch. After seeing the documents handed over by Klein, the corners of his mouth are slightly upturned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Neil teaches you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Klein did not hesitate to betray the old Neil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den picked up the dark red pen and brushed it and signed it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is just the right to apply for the funds in July, August and September from the church and the county police department. I will include you in this, and I will ask for Mrs. Oliana to take it out after approval, and I will be able to take it in the afternoon." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein replied succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His tone and gaze are all markedly gratifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the farewell, he asked casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"July, August, and September Shouldn’t the funding be completed in June?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunn was silent for a few seconds, picking up the coffee cup and snoring: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"June encountered three cases in a row, busy, busy, something was Forgot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a captain with poor memory... Klein knows that he has asked questions he shouldn’t ask, and laughed twice and hurryed out. In this way, he began a simple and regular life, half an hour of morning meditation, two hours of occult lessons in the morning, one and a half hours of historical information. Master, after lunch, take a nap in the lounge and rejuvenate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, receive the bullets, go to the "shooting club" practice, practice, then take a walk to the Welch residence, not far away, change the route, walk back to the iron cross Street, this can save a public bus fare, if you still have free, you will be skilled, smart and other skills, and by the way to buy a dish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A private chemical laboratory with complete instruments and articles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall, blond-smelling Audrey stares at the cup in her hand, and sees numerous bubbles popping out, making the atmosphere quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the liquid in the cup settles for a viscous silver white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, I really have the talent of occultism, I have succeeded once! I was worried about failure before, and prepared two full materials!" The girl rejoiced Language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She collected all the remaining materials from the family treasures and exchanged with others, took a deep breath, prepared to close her eyes and drink the cup "The audience" potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sound of "Wang Wang Wang" came from outside the laboratory, and Audrey frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put the silvery liquid-smooth cup into the dark corner, turned her body and walked to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Su Shi, who is here?" Audrey twisted the handle and asked the golden retriever dog sitting at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden-haired big dog Su Shi shakes his tail, looks good, and the close-fitting maid Anne appears in the nearby corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey walked out of the lab and grabbed the door and looked at Anne:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you said that? Don't bother me when I do a chemical experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie replied distressedly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "There may be an invitation from the Duchess, Mrs. Laura."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lady of the Duke of Nigan?" Audrey walked a few Step, close to Anne Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, she invited the court baker Ms. Wei Wei and invited her wife to have an afternoon tea." Annie said the contents of the invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey slightly invisibly slammed the gangsters:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell my mother, say I am dizzy, maybe the sun is too strong, a little dehydrated, please ask her to say sorry to Mrs. Jura on my behalf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, she made a Defeat look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss, this is not just afternoon tea, but a literature salon," Annie added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it can't cure my dizziness, I need to rest." Audrey firmly refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, she silently recited in her heart: If you persist, then I will faint to show you, the etiquette teacher said that this action is perfect. ...I seem to hear something? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Annie sighed. "Do you need me to help you back to the room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;But she still held her temper and watched Annie go away before she returned to the lab door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she found that the golden-haired big dog Su Shi, who should have been outside, was gone, and the lab door was half open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I forgot that Susie would open the door with a handle... What sound? Not good!" Audrey heard the crisp movement inside, suddenly With a Lenovo, I rushed into the lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was in sight of the cup that was shattered on the ground, the last drop of silvery white liquid from the Golden Retriever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey was stupid at the door, as if a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden-haired big dog Su Shi immediately sat down and looked at the owner with innocent eyes and shook his tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offshore location of Port Pritz, an island always covering the storm On, an ancient sailing ship stopped at the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man with a soft yellow hair and a lightning robes looking at the opposite Alger Wilson, very puzzled: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alge, you can go back to the kingdom, become the captain of the punitive squad or a decent bishop, why choose to go out to sea and choose to become the captain of the 'Blue Avenger'? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger's rough face has no extra expression, and he solemnly replies:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sea belongs to the storm. This is the kingdom of the Lord. I am willing to follow the will of the Lord and patrol the kingdom for him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Hold the boxing chest, "The storm is with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The storm is with you." Alger returned to the standard etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood on the deck of a few crew members and watched his companion leave the ghost ship and go further and further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sainz, you don't understand because you don't know enough..." Alger whispered silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Audrey was timid to complete the second modulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the silver potion that was no different from before, she almost shed tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, she drank the "audience" potion in a small mouth and quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday, a heavy rain hitting Tingen, slap The rain hits all the windows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Black Thorny Security Company, Klein, Rosanne and Bright sat on the sofa in the reception hall and enjoyed lunch on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is only a boiling water stove, there is no hot leftovers, and Klein can’t eat brown bread every day, or go back in the public carriage – then he’s afternoon After walking from Iron Cross Street to Welch's residence, I had to consider returning by car, which was a waste of money. Therefore, I had to follow Rosanne and other colleagues to eat the so-called "office meals." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The nearby Oldville restaurant will send a waiter on time at 10:30 every day, asking if there are several people who need lunch, after determining the number of copies, They will be delivered at 12:30, and will be served in a container similar to a lunch box. At three in the afternoon, they will ask if they have ordered dinner and recycled tableware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of "meal" has meat, vegetables, and bread, although the weight is not a lot, but it can barely make a person full, a meal from 7 Penny goes to 10 pence and has different grades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is cheeky, picking 7 pence each time, usually half a pound of oatmeal, a small piece of meat with different practices, a spoonful of vegetables Soup, and a little cream, or butter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today there is only one person who is worthy of the night..." Roshan sent the soup to the mouth with a spoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
