			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light that penetrates the glass illuminates the detention center outside the arsenal. Old Neil flips through the newspaper, drinks a coffee, and looks up at Klein: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you feel now? Have you calmed down? Or need a glass of wine, an early salary, a leisurely vacation of the day?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Klein, who thoroughly digested the "Divination" potion, is trying to change the "switch" of meditation with meditation, making it less conspicuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, he no longer relies on stimulating specific parts to open the vision, so he can achieve his goals in a more secret way, such as the thumb and the middle finger. Two joints at a time, such as the left tooth continuously tapping twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that at some point he had to hold a gun and a cane, but he had to use the vision, Klein finally chose to lick his teeth, left Closed on the right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously suggesting that after completing the change, he opened his eyes and smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just Too much attention to the captain's actions, and do not need to calm down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, his left tooth twitched twice, trying to open the vision, to Be familiar with this approach as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough and cough! Old Neal suddenly coughed up and coughed, like a cooked lobster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Klein snorted and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully examined the gas field of the old Neil and found that the healthy color of the other party was normal, but because of the age relationship, it was relatively weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil coughed for a dozen seconds before he slowed down. He probed his coffee and slowly sighed: "Everyone has a mistake." When I coughed, I was just stunned by my own sputum... Then we started today’s occult course?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Okay.” Klein’s right The teeth squinted almost silently twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being one or two weeks faster than expected, digesting the "Divination" potion makes him happy and troubled again, and he is glad to say that he is getting rid of the risk of losing control. Getting promoted and mastering more extraordinary abilities is enough to make anyone feel happy and excited. The trouble is that it disrupts his arrangements and plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that you have to stay in the Tingen City Night Club for a long time, Klein thinks that quietly becoming a "clown" is not a good choice, then it will always worry Exposure, in the task of needing to cooperate, do not dare to use the corresponding ability, let yourself fall into greater danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His plan is to emulate the "Psychic" Dai Li, submit a special application to the top, and use the accumulated merits in exchange for the rewards of formulas and extraordinary materials, and become a bright and honest The value of sequence 8 is the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a fundamental difference between "mastering" the potion and mastering the potion for one year. Klein can bear the attention of the church and is willing to be the focus. Cultivate the subject, but absolutely do not wish to attract high suspicion from the upper level, he must find a persuasive reason for his state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His original arrangement was to grasp the time when the "Divination" potion was not completely digested, and gradually made some preparations for the captain, such as Every time I go to the divination club, I feel spiritual and lively. For example, I pretend to describe the "Divination Code" that I have summarized from the divination. I have said that I have never heard of it recently. You should not see things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, the seniors of the night will think that he unconsciously imitated Dai Li when he completed the "mission" and did it more thoroughly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will allow them to focus on summarizing the law and exploring the direction of "playing the law", greatly reducing the suspicion of Klein, only to do Conductive review. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I can also remind the captain to help him discover the "playing the law"... Klein silently added a sentence to him, for him, Dunn Smith is a good captain. In addition to his poor memory, there are no major shortcomings, so he hopes to reduce his hidden dangers and make him stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Klein can also choose to wait a year to submit a special application, which will not take a risk, but continuous coincidence and dream divination The red chimney made him have to upgrade himself as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next two weeks to make three or four paves of time in the captain, and then formally apply... At the same time, you can also go to the underground trading market to see if there are corresponding extraordinary materials... it should be very expensive..." Klein quickly Make a decision and return your attention to the mystery course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, the beautiful lunch time is slowly coming, and the old Neil drinks the coffee in the cup and picks up the debris on the table. I laughed a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your mystery course is coming to an end, judging from the previous attempt, you can make a spell for yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly what I have scheduled for the next few days." Klein breathed out with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell is different from the amulet he gave to his brother Benson and his sister Melissa. It must be inscribed with the aid of the ritual and has certain special abilities that can be used. In the fierce battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the low-grade spell is also not a panacea, its spirituality will continue to decline, it must be re-made every two weeks, and it needs to be specific The mantra is turned on, and you can use it immediately if you want to use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the spells that can be mastered by the night are still limited to the "field" of the goddess of the night, and Klein can currently produce only three kinds, one is "sinking" Sleeping spells, the effect is similar to Dunn Smith and Leonard Mitchell's quiet and lethargic singing, one is the "Requiem of the Soul", can comfort ghosts, shadows, zombies and water ghosts, to a certain extent On the face of resentment and evil spirits, the first is the "dream charm", which can help the surgeon enter the dream of the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These effects and the "nnight sleeper" and "nightmare" abilities of the "sleepless" sequence are repeated, so Dunn and Leonard and others rarely use spells, but "The corpse" Frye and the "sleepless" Luo Yao and Cohen Li will carry one or two pieces with them, but they will not be used for a long time. From time to time, they have to find the old Neil "charge". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Old Neil glanced at Klein and smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I remember that because you practiced too often this month, the material quota is gone. Are you planning to go to the underground trading market?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is a glimpse, immediately nodding :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of those materials is clear to him, only hope once Success, don't waste...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After shouldering the task of sending lunch to the ground, Klein put on his coat, put on his hat, took his cane, and returned to the second. Blackthorn Security Company on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing through the entertainment room, he saw Leonard and others have returned and are dining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚! He knocked on the door of the captain's office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please come in." Dunn's mellow voice came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pushed in and took off the hat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, have caught 'Teacher's Terry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng pinched his temple and shook his head slightly tiredly: "We didn't find her at Tingen Station. However, according to a telegram from Beckland, some passengers saw her in the first class of the earliest class. Unfortunately, she got off the bus halfway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It's a pity." Klein had been psychologically prepared to sigh. "Divination is not a panacea..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng ash slams: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to be frustrated, the extraordinary person of Sequence 7 is not so easy to catch, at least we destroyed the evil ritual of Talis, saved at least four The life of ten innocent people, and we have mastered her current situation, so that she can no longer arbitrarily sin as before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She Still want to do something similar Feelings, they may be noticed at any time, discovered, and reported, sooner or later, by our night-timers, or punitives, mechanical minds, and, of course, more likely to be killed."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hopefully, Goddess bless you." Klein painted a red moon on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
