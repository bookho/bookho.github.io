			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main entrance to Patrick Jason’s house was suddenly opened, and a group of night-timers in black coats ran in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are alert and alert, as if they are facing an enemy of extreme horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬,蹬,蹬, a silver full body armor came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives people an unusually heavy feeling, and the details follow the old style, while the left shoulder is slanting down to the lower abdomen, which is contaminated with a splash. The dark red blood stains of the cleaning, together with the sputter-type red dots in the rest of the place, constitute a very fascinating picture, like a unique and gorgeous decoration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Soulist" Soest took a look at his pocket watch:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver body armor stopped, raised his hand and picked up the visor, revealing the wearer inside, it was a hairy tourmaline, quite Handsome man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leonard, the second floor master bedroom washroom, is ready for hot water, don't delay time, otherwise you can only return to the embrace of the goddess." Sterling said a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Captain Soest." Leonard Mitchell took off the heavy blood-stained silver armor with the help of the rest of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not chilling in red gloves, did not hesitate, went straight to the second floor and found a bathtub that was still steaming with white mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brushing brush, Leonard quickly undressed, lying in the hot water, and even the nose was not exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His skin quickly turns red, like cooked lobster, and the surface gradually has a scary, silvery pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver streaks spread like a pure sword and spread out into the hot water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a matter of ten seconds, the white mist of the steam disappeared, and the hot water surface even condensed a thin and transparent ice floe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the silver lines were all scattered, Leonard turned and sat up, panting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His micro-head, if he is listening, then lowers the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old man, Do you know the origin of '1—42'?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately sounded a slightly old voice in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are becoming more and more rude.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know the origin of the strange armor. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to wait for Leonard to ask again, he snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I probably I recognized the owner of the blood. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it?" Leonard curiously asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly old voice said low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" An ancient god before the Cataclysm. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South Bridge, Rose Garden, Harvest Church.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just stepped into the quiet prayer hall and saw Father Uttraski and the vampire Emlin White, one after the other, sitting one high and one short In the chair, hands and fingers touch, palms are implied, placed in front of the mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the exclusive prayer posture of the Mother Earth Church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Emlin White is gentle and peaceful, and can’t see the arrogance and troubles before.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Klein micro-moving his mouth, silently painted a triangular emblem on his chest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He randomly found a position to sit down and waited until the end of the prayer before he walked to Emlin White. He said with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today you are exceptional Devotion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Emlin woke up and said palely, "What did I do, what I did..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is getting lower and seems to have recalled what he has just done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe it's not a bad thing." Klein comforted the other person with unconvincing words and immediately sat next to the vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to hear people say this, although I feel that resistance is getting less and less..." Emlin blackened his face and used A bit of a crying voice, "But I don't want to betray the moon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't continue the topic that made the vampire sad, and asked casually: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you worship the blood of the primitive moon, or a certain god on the moon? Or, can the two be equal?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything." Emlin lifted his chin slightly. "For the orthodox blood family, of course, the god who represents the moon. He is called Lilith, the ancestor of our blood family. An ancient god, and human beings become blood, more inclined to worship the original moon. Under normal circumstances, the two can be equal, but sometimes they do not overlap and differ."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Humans become a blood family?" Klein can tell Emlin White that Lilith is the second generation. The name of God is not unexpected, but it is more concerned with the so-called human race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "vampire" sequence that Mr. Azick mentioned? He thought silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin’s expression is slightly more complicated: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, there are two kinds, One is transformed from a strong blood group to the first, and one takes the corresponding potion, and the latter is our most hated enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why "Klein vaguely guessed the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main material of their potion is our blood Source essence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough... Klein couldn’t help but look up and down and looked at Emlin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin, who was a little bit nervous about him, snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You already It’s an extraordinary person, you can’t change the way again!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m just the first time I saw walking, no, alive, no, extraordinary material that can talk ... However, in a sense, every human extraordinary person is also such a material... Klein originally wanted to arbitrarily sing a word in his heart, but it quickly caused a strong sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Emlin looked at the Utravsky bishop who was carefully wiping the emblem of life, and lowered the voice: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found two materials you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?" Klein didn't hide his delight. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin responded fluently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thousands of hunters' brain changes The pituitary and its blood, the other party's asking price is 2,000 pounds for the former and 300 pounds for the latter 100 milligrams, a total of 2,300 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2300... Klein blurted out: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can it be cheaper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the bail, he currently has all the cash A total of 2,185 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the middle class, this is already quite ample deposit, and some may get so much money in a lifetime, but Klein found that this is not enough... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, if it weren't for me, he would have wanted 2,800 pounds. According to the agreement, you have to pay me an extra 150 pounds, for a total of 2,450 pounds." Emlin shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Kline’s expression, he made a quick addition:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the era, dragons are rare and rare. In addition to the long blood races, it is difficult for you to find similar extraordinary materials elsewhere. Even if they are, they will be more expensive than this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The difference is 265 pounds... It’s so hard to squander so much money, it’s about to be completely emptied, and it’s not enough... I hope that Mr. “downside down” will sell the extraordinary features of “Werewolf” as soon as possible... The characteristics of the shadow of the skin and the hair of the deep sea Naga will not be much cheaper than this... The small "sun" is still unable to determine the situation, and it is necessary to keep it for a while. He owes me a reward, it is best to remove the magical item. The method of mental pollution caused by the out-of-control person to repay, this is more concealed... Klein has a lot of thoughts, and only the light outside the window is faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But after a delay in the transaction, I recently provoked a guy who is being protected by the official extraordinary. You should not want the seller to be locked to the bottom of the church? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have to collect the rest of the money... Klein leaned his head and looked at the dome of the church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Official extraordinary? "Emlin White was shocked and stood up and looked around.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gave him a look:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't care, you are now the priest of the Mother Earth Church, have a legal identity, and the Utravsky Main Church shelters you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not..." Emlin's denial is powerless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He re-sitting Down, whimsy: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which official extraordinary can solve the psychological suggestion of this problem? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe. "Klein almost laughed. "But then, you will become a goddess of the night god, the god of steam and machinery, the believer of the storm, and of course you can choose to be a member of the military special department. They may Will send you to go abroad to be a spy, seduce which noble lady. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only like dolls and pure and beautiful girls! Emlin immediately stressed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that you have a little bit of movement, but only a little... Klein turned and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know the people of the Beria family? In Beckland's. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beria? The madman family that worships the devil? No, they are demons themselves! Emlin snorted. "What are you looking for?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is helpless:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am offended by one of them, Patrick. Jason Beria, because of a serial killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You help me in your circle to find out about his recent whereabouts and acquaintances. If there is any exact information, I will give you a reward. It depends on the importance of the information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this can be reimbursed for the night, the heart of the machine and the military... Klein relaxes Thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin nodded thoughtfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You dare to provoke a real Devil.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you have his exact message, he will know that you will cause serious harm to him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, I have official extraordinary protection." Klein didn't care to answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin was silent for a while, only a few seconds later:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
