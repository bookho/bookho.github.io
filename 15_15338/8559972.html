			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frost dragon Yurisian rushed to the position where the monk Snoman originally stood, but nothing hit, directly slipped over and dragged out long A gully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind it, the fireballs blasted one after another, and another fireworks was made. Klein’s body was slightly stiff and flashed, not being “Northern The king opened the distance and was always within 5 meters of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Eusian stopped, he was still in a state of invisibility, and he had a bad feeling. He had a corresponding picture in his mind, and he rushed forward and almost posted. The ground was drilled under the Frost Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Uris Ann’s thick and powerful tail slammed open and swept out, drawing to the nearby Elf singer Shahta Silk and Solomon Empire nobles Mobetter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind creaked, Mobetter was thrown out, avoiding the tail of the Frost Dragon, and Shatass took a slow shot, although there was a gust of wind , stepping back along the trend of sweeping, in order to resolve the power, but still have to be pumped in the side, pumping her thick and fascinating scales broken, pulling her rib roots broken, so she flew out, in the wind Under the support, not too heavy to fall on the snowy ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Mobetter, Anderson, etc., this blow is enough to make them die on the spot, but fortunately the "storm" approach has corresponding magic scale protection, and each The sequence will be upgraded accordingly, and Shatas is only seriously injured, not coma, and even the mobility is not completely lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "King of the North" Yurisian's neck twitched, his mouth opened, and a light blue wave was spit out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wave sweeps over Snowman and freezes the bitter monk into an ice sculpture, and Edwina, Longzel and Anderson are either blocked by a huge dragon. Or if you use other extraordinary abilities, or if you are too far apart, you have no time to rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Frost Dragon jumps low and steps on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, its state has also dropped significantly, and the right shoulder rupture is abnormally stunned - although the frozen pale blue blood sputum has forced the injury to worsen, The corresponding front paws are almost paralyzed and not very convenient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fantasy scales on the surface of the body are broken and become very bleak, as if losing a lot of vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what, it also hit or limited three opponents, the situation is much better than before, especially the giant Grosser’s serious injury, more It is to let it no longer be entangled, and it can be offensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this situation, Edwina’s light blue eyelids became dark again, and the sticky sorrows slowly flowed inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her right palm jerked tightly, "The King of the North" Yurisian looked up again, extremely painful, with pale blue eyes and mouth The liquid flows out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the ice dragon’s mind is full of explosive emotions that impact the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take this opportunity, Edwina’s eyes turned bright and became extremely pure, and the morning light shone rapidly and condensed into a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to play the role of "guardian" and go up to block the "king of the north." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She believes that Gilman Sparo is invisible to Yurisian, and certainly has his purpose, only the time is missing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a figure shrouded the brilliance from dawn and rushed to the front of the Frost Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the giant Grosser! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a hollow chest, gray-blue skin is white, and a broad-sword in his hand has a spider-like crack, but still bravely greets the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grossel is like burning life, emitting light and heat, and a sword is on the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Giant will never back down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In roar, Grosser once blocked Under the slap of the Frost Dragon, and because the other front paw was scrapped, there is still room to avoid the ice blue breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captivity!" "The disciplinary knight" Longzel rushed over and began to restrict the action of the "King of the North". Edwina also found a tacit understanding. When Yurisian broke out of bondage with anger, it detonated its emotions. The control is continuous, so that the high-speed collision no longer occurs. Anderson then throws out the blazing rifle and sometimes creates the condensed fireball, which hurts the opponent to the greatest extent again and again. After Mobate slows down, he continues to steal ideas and steal. Ability to interfere with the attack of the Frost Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysian tried to spread his wings twice, fanning the ice and snow, flying in the air, and it was hard to be affected by Longzeer’s superimposed “no flight”. Slow, can only give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s constantly changing the position of Klein, who is constantly changing the position of the “spiritual line”, has reached the limit of 20 seconds, but Still unsuccessful, because the spirit of "King of the North" is powerful and crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, when a loud bang came out, Grosser’s broad sword was caught in the front paw after being contaminated by the frosty dragon. Suddenly cracked open, turned into countless pieces, splashed in different positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sound of the cockroach, Grosell’s invisible wall near the limit was penetrated, and several pieces of debris plunged into his head. , plunged into his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearest "disciplined knight" Longzel did not have time to escape, was crushed side armor, the corresponding position was bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The giant will never back down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grosser once again sorghum, look at the morning Dasheng, there is a pure lightsaber in the palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark red blood of the face, he blocked the Frost Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein manipulated the "line of the spirit" with the strings, and finally saw the dawn of the initial control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three seconds! Two seconds! One second! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "King of the North" Yurisian's action is stuck, and every joint in the body seems to be covered with rust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Frost Dragon immediately alerted and noticed that the source of danger came underneath, and when the mind was not completely slow, there was a moment of sitting. The next decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wants to put the sinister and vicious guy into a meat sauce! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, it’s awkward in his mind, forgetting what he just wanted to do, and Mobate Soloas’s feet more than 20 meters away. A soft, strangely sat down and sat on the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the opportunity to move, not too fast but not too slow to walk to the side of the ice dragon's hind legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His stealth effect began to recede, after all, the simulation is definitely not as good as the original, his hands are half-stretched, spiritual jumping, as if manipulating a huge puppet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urisian, who has been slow in thinking, has recovered the decision just now, his hind legs are slowly bent, and the body peaks are crushed down, but they can only stir up the pervasive Snow and dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No...not good...must...that...they’s thoughts flashed one after another in a clear order, the heart twitches and shrinks, condenses light blue The terrible glory of the near white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the extraordinary ability that stems from its life, can create an extremely cold hell, before relying on it, let Klein and others all freeze, if not The experience and ability of the monk Snoman have been quite restrained in this state. There are more than one or two extraordinary people who have just died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this moment, under the control of Klein, everything that Ulysian did was significantly slowed down, and Edwina was keenly I noticed the source of danger that I couldn't grasp before, and immediately held the right palm, once again detonating the huge fluctuations of the Frost Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the "King of the North" shook with a slow-motion gesture, and the pale blue near-white brilliance that was about to condense spread out uncontrollably. Can interfere with the surrounding environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...ah..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Frost Dragon's mouth slowly opens and sends out The stuttering screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
