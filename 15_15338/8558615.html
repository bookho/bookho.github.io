			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, in the palace of the giant residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein fingers tapped the edge of the mottled long table, and thoughts continued to revolve around the strange scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It allows me to accept the impact without any abnormality...this is almost the same as the original '0-08', just one in front of me One hides behind the scenes... It must be a seal, and it belongs to the top, even if it is not '0', it is a very special presence in the '1' level...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fate of this kind of thing, I can not interfere temporarily, but can not passively respond, as time goes by, similar levels of seals often cause more serious damage, may affect the fat pharmacist around People, such as me and the passengers on the ship..." Klein thought for a while, no clue, decided to return to the real world immediately.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't know what to do Sealing the scorpion or how to weaken its influence, but he knows that someone knows.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is still in the mother's stomach, still in the fetal state of "mercury Snake" Will Anthony!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the master bedroom After taking out the paper crane from the wallet and unfolding it on the table, Klein looked at the surface of the wiping mark, picked up the pencil, and wrote a simple question:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the dice handled? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He folded the thousand paper cranes back, stuffed them into the wallet, and then went outside the servant's room and tapped three times.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a violation of the German Sparrows, because he is a gentleman of literary grace, of course, Klein is mainly afraid of rushing to open the door will directly lead to the unlucky fat pharmacist Dak Will is killed, this belongs to the "Death is coming" series of movies to let him grow his knowledge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Klein is still worried that directly opening the door will see spicy eyes The picture.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the preferences expressed by Dakwell, he found himself in an extremely dangerous situation and was difficult to get rid of, only to wait for death, There is no small probability to decide the final cool... Klein's belly, I heard the fat pharmacist responded with anger: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not dead yet... Klein carefully opened the door, leaned forward slightly, looked at Dakwell and the ring box opened in front of him, calmly asked道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What time? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there a wall clock..." Dakwell is still the unspirited look.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked the blind man. "Klein succinctly added.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's still 3 o'clock..." Dakwell first answered instinctively, then twisted his head and jumped up. "You believe Me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not respond, lest the other party think of the scene where German Sparrow had just been fooled by the blind.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his body and said nothing in his tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bring the scorpion out. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkwell and Owl Harry are pleasantly surprised, almost at the same time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are one With arms raised, one raised his wings.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat pharmacist took the ring box very carefully, and Klein pointed to the tea:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" put it on top. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said while sitting next to the sofa, with his elbows on his thighs, his body tilted forward to examine the strange scorpion.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the outside, this scorpion does not have any eccentric eccentricities, the only difference from the normal one is that even three points are used in red.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein cautiously didn't touch, slightly straightened up, looking at the fat pharmacist Dakwell sitting on the opposite chair and the fat owl Harry who fell to the top of the chair:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Describe the specific situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell has no more concealment, laughing more than crying and ugly:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is an important seal within our organization, and my task is to send it to the hands of the Olavic designated personnel.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, you also saw it, it is very dangerous, it will turn on its own, even if there is no corresponding space! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When it turns to 6 o'clock, the holder will be lucky enough to do anything easily and easily, just like I used a rather lame lie It’s the same as deceiving you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t mention this...you’ll one day be stunned by the mouth...Klein doesn’t Listening to the expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell continues to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1 point means the holder will be very unlucky, Nothing can be successful, even if I tell you everything without concealing it, you won't believe it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2 points should be a little lighter The misfortune, why can it cause me to be hit by lightning... This is incomprehensible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "3 and 4 points are normal unlucky and lucky, this can be confirmed. 5 points correspond to 2 points."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not bad enough, otherwise I have already yelled at you... Klein thought about it and calmly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "From now on, you take turns monitoring this scorpion. When it falls below 3, tell me immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We?" I was a bit stunned at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Include me?" The owl at the top of the back of his chair raised his right wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned back on the back of the sofa and picked up his right leg, calmly saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This helps to maintain energy and maintain attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, he pointed his owl at the chin:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You start first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Harry." The owl muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry...Klein resisted the smile and turned to Dirkwell:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You go to pull the bell and let the waiter come over. From now on, we choose to deliver the food.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before you arrive in Olawe, you must stay In the living room, you can't go anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if you want to enter the bathroom, you have to be at 3 o'clock and 4 o'clock.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If I can't help, I will give you a bucket." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to Gelman Sparo's methodical command, fat pharmacist Dakwell settled down a bit, no longer as fearful as before.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing he was most worried about was that the greed of German Sparrow was induced, he chose to kill and rob the goods, and the second was that this crazy crazy adventurer was The nephew was scared, decided to interrupt the commission, no longer provide protection.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now it seems that German Sparrow is not afraid, even confidence is not small! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell sighed in relief and thought:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His performance Really professional...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And not afraid at all!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can still learn from the scorpion Forced to break free from the influence, accept my explanation, it is a powerful adventurer who can easily kill 'smartwriters'! Definitely the strong pirate general! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell stood up and walked to the door, ringing the service bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he returned to the sofa area, the ear whispered the sound of the owl Harry sharply:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Changed, changed!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2 points! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, Klein slammed his feet on the sofa without any warning, and rushed to the side of Kewell.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time a gunshot was heard, Klein pulled Dakwell’s arm The arm is pulled back, the wrist is shaking, and the chubby pharmacist is taken to the other side.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Dakwell originally stood on the wall corresponding to the position, A hole made by a bullet.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a fire with a pistol? Or when shooting a seabird and other targets, hitting it somewhere, bounced in? No matter which In this case, the probability of occurrence is very low. As a result, Klein looks at the fat pharmacist sideways:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there any injury? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell is afraid of shaking his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following period, Klein successively solved ten accidents, including the sudden fall of the roof chandelier, and the slippery maintenance worker's hammer went straight to Dak. Will's head, the fat pharmacist's throat was almost killed by the fishbone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This doesn't look too great, but for Klein it needs to be mentally high. Concentration, exhaustion is inevitable.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the scorpion turned to 4 o'clock and finally ended the disaster-filled hour.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, go on like this, maybe I will have an accident when I save people... Klein sent the captain who apologized and said to Dakwell:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I slept for half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You stare at the scorpion and wake me up with problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat pharmacist and owl At the same time, the chicken nodded as a food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of the sofa, Klein quickly fell asleep with meditation, hoping that Will Ansett has responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was awake in his dreams and saw the dark and deserted plains, he quietly sighed and walked along the familiar road to the black spire deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a line of silvery words on the raised floor surrounded by a tarot card, which was dense and numerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stopped and quickly browsed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's called 'the probability of success' .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" is the highest level seal in our school, I think it can reach the '0' level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It controls the probability of each thing, the probability of adversely affecting the target is amplified to the limit at 1 o'clock, and the unfavorable probability is greatly increased at 2 o'clock. It does not mean that 2 points must be safer than 1 point, because once the probability becomes higher, any accidents may occur. 3 points are to enlarge the unfavorable probability, and 4 to 6 points are opposite.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even for me who can reset the process to a certain extent, it is a very dangerous seal. Use it to kill the gods and, of course, kill yourself. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the battle between you and the probability is like the confrontation between the goddess of Savolud and the god of the nephew (Note 1)... Klein is in his heart Spoken a sentence, and then continue reading:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The probability of 骰" has a living characteristic, always let the holder back and forth between luck and luck, slightly If you don't pay attention, you will die because of accident. When it wakes up to a high enough level, it will bring the people and things around the holder into their own control and manipulate the probability of their behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
