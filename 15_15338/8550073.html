			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fool who does not belong to this age... the mysterious ruler above the fog... the king of yellow and black who is in good luck..." Audrey Huo Ermer read the descriptions of these three paragraphs, and suddenly he rushed into the wind and waves, and could no longer maintain the "audience" state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a lover of occultism, before she was pulled into this fog, she did not formally contact the extraordinary power, but when she was in private party with the same nobles They will still exchange their own masterful and unintelligible situations. They will learn the Hermes language used for sacrifices and try some rituals from other populations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the rituals have no effect, but Audrey has some understanding of the formatted mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, she is well aware of what the three-segment description of the Fools represents in other ceremonies:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; That means, that points to, seven gods who overlook the whole world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost equivalent to "The Lord of the Red, the Secret Mother, the Queen of Evil and Fear"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Fool is the existence of the unknown, hidden, powerful, and spiritually mentioned by Glylint? Is it a source of danger that must be carefully avoided during the ceremony? Audrey soon remembered the sighs of friends who tried to try and did not dare to try some weird rituals. I couldn’t speak for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than she knows, learn more about Alger Wilson from the heart of the tremble:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "If the ritual magic designed by the fool can really point to him and let him receive our request, then it must be honored by him, using this to describe the gods and similar third-person respects..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so lucky, it’s wise enough, I’ve been acting very well, not doing some stupid things, even if temptations are in the normal range...” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He may be an old, hidden, horrible existence, but without the original appearance and real name appearing before our eyes... the original The witch, the hidden sage, or the true creator of several mystical sects?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger understands that the fool he sees now is not necessarily his real The image of the other party does not even have sex, not necessarily a humanoid creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein helped one hand and tapped the edge of the bronze long table, keenly aware of the changes in "downside down" and "justice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he pretends that nothing has happened, giving the state that everything is expected, and continues to say to himself:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for your care."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray that you will let me have a good dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deep sleep flowers, herbs belonging to the Red Moon, please pass the power Give me the mantra."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vanilla, the herb that belongs to the sun, please pass the power to my mantra."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He described a spell that belongs to another format, and finally laughed: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms., sir, remember?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." Audrey whispers A moment, quickly pouting, began to seriously think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the powerful memory of the "audience", she quickly recorded it and repeated it for confirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger is doing a lot better than her, no matter what she thinks, the pen in her hand has never stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein affirmed Audrey’s record and smiled slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If successful, the next time you can modify the mantra slightly to achieve the purpose we want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the latest no more than Wednesday, I hope you can find free Complete this ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He plans to re-enter here on Thursday night to confirm whether the ritual magic has worked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The reason why the "inverted" and "justice" are not directly prayed for "absence" is because Klein is worried that it is impossible to tell that they really want to "Leave off", or the result of trying ritual magic, when is it pulling or not? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow your will." Audrey and Alger converge on the emotions, and answer with a compliment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the last offer of the hangman, after the business is the chat phase, who starts first?" Klein gave the gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey indulged in a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Fool, the last time you gave The examination screening and the separation of affairs and government proposals have been recognized by many Members. Perhaps it may become actual. Of course, with the efficiency of the Royal Government, the program will only be available in half a year."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not worried that "upside down" will find her identity based on this matter, because she just casually guided two sentences and let those proud The husbands thought that their excellent minds played a role, so that they could not wait to show off to their husbands, their fathers, their brothers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, Audrey felt that she had seen a golden peacock that only opened the screen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She believes that those husbands will constantly hint at themselves, attribute the honor of this matter to themselves, and completely forget their role, who is the first to argue with each other from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And using this ingenious way to change the situation in the kingdom, let Audrey have a strange sense of accomplishment, it seems that finding the "audience" can also affect the dramatic plot The way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope so." "Inverted" Alger said with a mocking tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused for a few seconds, looking at the head of the bronze long table, and pondered the language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" In recent decades, the number of activities of various secret organizations has increased, and there have even been several new, large-scale organizations with certain extraordinary strengths."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to find out why from me? I haven't started to contact the "illegal organization" information... Klein just smiled and didn't comment on the news of "swinging people" and turned to ambiguity.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Some ancient powers are waking up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the power represented by the Antignus family notes...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it..." Alger whispered and seemed to think of something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein swept through the "downside down" and swept "justice", said with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If there is nothing else to share, then today's party is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow your will." Audrey and Alger Get up at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slipped his fingers and broke the connection with the deep red star, watching the two figures disappear into the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and turned to his high back chair, which is behind the top seat of the bronze long table, looking at the constellation symbol there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;璀璨The stars are linked to a quirky symbol, not in the scope of Klein’s current occult knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully identified for a while, from which he saw the "innocent eye" symbolizing concealment, and saw the "distorted line" symbolizing change. Each of them lacks a part, overlaps each other, and forms a new symbol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Incomplete secrets, incomplete changes... What do you mean by adding up?" Klein frowned and couldn't think of an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He regained his gaze and walked around the magnificent, ancient temple, with no sight in any corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was so casually thinking about it, only giving a rough idea, not specifically describing the shape of the palace, the long table and the chair...that their What does it look like? Optimized choices? Initial template? Or realistic mapping?” Klein looked at it and suddenly thought of a problem that was previously ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
