What does this mean? The two did not dare to think deeply, as if they had returned to the original. At that time, a secret stronghold of the Rebels was discovered by the Lun Army. They were swept away without warning. The parents of both of them died in the massacre, women. Relatives were taken away and sold to different places. Before receiving the bad news, Karat and Edmonton’s mood was just like this time. Precipitation, panic, expectation and uneasiness became a strong depression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back to the jungle, find the high priest, figure out the reason, maybe, this is the latest revelation that God has given us..." Karat turned the wheelchair and said in a loud voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edmonton immediately stood up and left the rest of the hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You continue to look for Those who are awkward, but don't stay here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, tell the believers outside, don't hold any ceremonies recently, don't even pray! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an unexpected change in the matter, which made him particularly vigilant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byyam, the corner of the street where the Church of the Waves is located.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi holds A stack of folded white papers, a little nervous, a little worried and a little puzzled, asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, put them separately on this street The different places, and finally the gate of the Wave Church? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was afraid that the church door would suddenly open and rush out of the group of priests and bishops who were wielding their fists. They did not ask themselves to post the notice and directly launched the attack.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein maintains a cold state:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His original intention was to transfer the "Poseidon" Cavitowa to Mr. "Inverted Man", who reminded the Storm Church, but considered The other party still holds the secret of Banxi Port, and may even have handed it out. It is easy to be suspicious of another important information in a short time, so the final decision is to come by yourself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the method, it is very simple, put a few notices at the door of the "Public Punisher", so that they can see when they come out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan is in There was a small problem in the implementation, that is, Klein could not tell which company around the church in the church was a foreigner of "the punisher", so that Daniz had to work harder and posted the conspicuous places. , including but not limited to the main entrance of the Church of the Waves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......I should have run away before... Why did I think this guy saved me? Life, perhaps because of another powerful adventurer, I have become a golden pound... No, who Thinking of this madman is so easy to solve the curse of "Poseidon", the escape may be even worse... Daniz lamented two words in his heart, unfolded the stack of white paper, and glanced at the above content:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Latticia. Dorera and others left after the remains of 'Poseidon' on the island of Symi, and were pursued by the Rebels. At the same time, Karat and other rebel forces were on sale. A slightly curved singular bone sword; the shape of 'Poseidon' Cavitewa is on the verge of collapse, and the state of mind is extremely crazy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Daniels stunned for two seconds, subconsciously glanced at German Sparrow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand before, but why is there a description of the "Poseidon" Cavitehua body is on the verge of collapse, the state of mind is extremely crazy, etc. How does Gelman Sparrow know? He is solving the "Poseidon" "In the process of cursing, I found a problem? How did he solve the "Poseidon" curse? The organization behind him is stronger and more terrible than I thought... Is it similar to the "Aurora"? A true god? Daniz is more and more timid.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first heard that the "Aurora" originated from a sea plunder. At that time, he saw the captain's dignified expression for the first time, and then he was taught some so-called mysterious world common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein responded to Daniz’s gaze with no emotional ups and downs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that notice, he dismissed his own subjective speculation and described only those things that can be affirmed, so as not to interfere with the judgment of the top of the storm church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, the contents of Lattia and others taking away an important item were deleted, and the lost temple was changed to a broader and more inclusive one. The remains of the Poseidon, Karat and others, who apparently gave up after an accident in the case of the "Poseidon", were omitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz plucked his gaze and dared not look again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain said that the more secrets someone knows, the more dangerous! He thought about it and worried: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way it is attached to the main entrance of the church, it will definitely attract the attention of the storm church.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do they find out what I did? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein succinctly gave the answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Daniz forcibly squeezes out the smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I am not very dangerous ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein used the power of the "clown" to control his expression and calmly replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You were originally a pirate who was rewarded. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that you can now sway and walk on the main street of Baiam? Klein whispered in his heart.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, no matter what, they will catch me and reward me... No, this is a problem! Daniz blurted out and debuted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "My reward will increase! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at him, didn't speak, just opened his mouth a little.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Daniz seems to hear a question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn’t this a good thing?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;驴Good things to play! Daniz smiled twice, holding the stack of notices, staying up late and hurried, posting them in the conspicuous place near the street of the Wave Church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;It’s like a small advertisement... Klein, who is in a single-handed pocket, looks far away and evaluates it in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately exclaimed :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having an assistant is really good, at least you don’t have to do anything to do this yourself... change it to Tingen or Beckland, if there is something like Things... The picture is too beautiful to think...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz finally came outside the church of the Wave, posted the notice on the main entrance, and then clenched his fist , 咚咚 knock on the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, he turned his head and ran. It seems that there are already ten "daily punishers" running out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein does not Dare to scorn, pull out the paper man, shake your wrist and open it, let it burn into ashes, and quickly move to another street.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After recent contacts He has already deeply realized the style of "the punishers" and dare not have the slightest effect.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talents slow down and return to normal until they are far away from the church of the waves The speed of walking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz is a good physique, and he still has a blushing face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He asked with a little doubt: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you write directly to the police station or throw it into the Governor's Office? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for Klein to answer, he already realized: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, the lower police and governor’s offices are locals and are likely to sympathize with the rebels. Even the hidden 'Poseidon' believers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two turned around the corner and saw a large red building in front, inside The lights are bright, the music is hidden, the people at the door come and go, the carriages alternate, there is no feeling of late night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hah, I came here." After a second of Deniz, there was a smile that men knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Theatre? Klein, who is rich in theoretical knowledge, is in awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz smirked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the most famous of the entire Sonia sea area One of the places, the mystical style of the Bailang girl, the passionate Fenelope girl, the open and attractive Intis girl, the tall and beautiful Wessack girl, the conservative and quiet Lun, There are gentle and tamed locals..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy knows a lot... often come? Klein glanced at the "flame" and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz has a feeling of being seen through, and suddenly laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is what the pirates said when they brag. I have only been there a few times.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past, there was no money, only general, and mainly in the foggy sea. Over there, I later joined the 'Golden Dream'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder... Although the "Iceberg Lieutenant" is well treated, he often gets the treasure. But it is quite difficult to get down a few houses in Baiam... Compared to the average pirate, this guy knows at least temperance and knows how to save money... Klein thinks awkwardly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz doesn't want to continue this topic, he opens the door:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Baiam, there are a lot of street girls, especially There. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the distance:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There were pirates who tried and knocked Open a family's door, take out the money, and ask for a visit with the hostess. As a result, three or four of the ten families agree. Hey, if it is your standard Lun appearance, there will be almost no rejection, only quietly. Hide your own daughter and let you discover it. Oh, every year, Lun’s navy will commit many murders and rape cases here. It’s not much better than the pirates, but they will only be driven back to the country. Fine..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened quietly, and suddenly remembered the group of "Poseidon" believers who prayed around the pool in the evening, recalling Their fanatical and numb faces.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Aude In the family of the La family.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White, who actively exposed certain problems, followed Casimimi to the ground with some nervousness. In the lower area, come again to the gray stone hall where the black iron color is parked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear Nibes, why are you calling me? "Emlin has already previewed a similar scene in her heart for dozens of times, but still can't completely eliminate the inner tension and embarrassment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He suddenly wanted to understand a problem. From a theatrical point of view, the role he played should be hidden and feared at this time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No special camouflage required ...... I did a good job! Emlin suddenly calmed down a lot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old voice is from the inside of the symbolic and magical logo Outgoing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to praise you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the ancestors, you risked praying to the 'fool', and although they did not receive a response, they still bear a lot of risks, which is a must-win behavior. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a 7,000-pound acceptance bill, which is a reward for you. It was not given to you in time because of the Bakerland smog incident. late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
