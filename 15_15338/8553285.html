			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cold and chilly hall, Klein suddenly shuddered and took his eyes back, saying to the bodyguard:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the performance of the Azick copper whistle, most of the innermost rooms have horrible evil spirits. The degree of danger is likely to be above the "secret master" Rosago and "the hurricane lieutenant" Kiringes... It has been smashed for hundreds of thousands of years, perhaps equal to the high sequence strong, if not its power Difficulties in revealing the room, I am already a dead person... Even if the bodyguard is a leader in the sequence 5, I have little hope of turning it over with her... I have to be self-aware, not to be suspected of extraordinary features and magical items. "Treasure" temptation... Greed often leads to death... Klein quietly finds reasons to convince himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young bodyguard looked at him sideways and looked intently without any emotion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After? Klein quietly licked his teeth and thought about the language: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let Miller Carter call the police, who knows when the evil spirits can get out of trouble, can solve as soon as possible It will solve it as soon as possible, no, no, Mr. Carter does not know much. In such a way, the police will pay less attention to it. The first people who come to explore and inspect will be seriously injured and may even help the evil spirits to get rid of the bondage. Also, when I saw such a statue, my detective might be wiped out... Fore... Did you see the bones and spiritual brilliance in the room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young bodyguard re-applied her gaze to the dark squat after the half-opening stone door, and the position was very small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thoughts electric turn:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guess those are the bodies of previous explorers, They were killed in the room by the evil spirits, and the extraordinary ones left behind magical items, which may be related to the Viscount family who originally lived in the outer house. I intend to ask their names and go to the library to find materials. And look for their descendants to see if they can get useful clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the initial situation is determined, I will make a choice based on the severity, maybe get some Explosives, ruining the door, not letting others in, may also send an anonymous letter to the police department to describe in detail the existence of evil spirits. However, this must be done in advance to avoid risks."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not too urgent, you can take it slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguard is quietly listening, looking straight ahead, the tone is erratic Say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you not consider organizing people to purify the evil spirit?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if there are no magical items left behind, it is only precious that the remaining parts of the evil spirits are dissipated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The first time I saw you saying so much... Probably... Klein replied without hesitation: "The risk is too high, I think my life and health are more important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He organized the language and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The strongest person I know is you, and Look at the performance, you don't seem to be the opponent of the evil spirit, I can't imagine it, in addition to the alarm, there is still a way to solve it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young bodyguard Turned over the body, the pale face was slightly transparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still have reason." She calmly and indifferently evaluated a sentence, then drifted to the exit of the ancient hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides being suspected of being influenced by the "real creator", where do I be like a madman? Klein whispered, carrying a lantern and a cane, followed closely behind the bodyguard, and throughout the process, he always felt that he was staring at the cold eyes in the dark road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the out of the ancient stone door, this feeling is dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned his body, closed the door, closed the inverted candlestick, the knife-like brand and the evil six-god statue, let them continue "Sleeping" in the darkness and silence that has remained unchanged for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller Carter was walking in the basement and saw Klein coming out and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? What is the situation inside?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has already thought about the rhetoric, revealing the expression of fear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very bad, there are many snakes, In many places, there have been collapses. I plan to collect some information, find people, prepare for it, and do a second exploration. During this time, you better not send people in. Believe me, the snake is more than you. Imagine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old gentleman Miller took a light breath and asked with a little fear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Do they swim over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know professionals who deal with snakes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately nodded: "I will find someone to cooperate and try to handle this matter. It is a cold autumn. The snakes are not willing to move. As long as you don't send people into it, you won't have it. Even "What's the matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, please as soon as possible, I will close this door during this time, and let no one go in." Miller heard, Relax a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw the real but not all of the words grabbed the employer, and put down the lantern, pushing the Phnom Penh glasses:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, I will collect some information, first to figure out the layout of the underground building and then explore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You need to tell me which of the original owners of this house is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller is buying the building for the name of the former aristocratic industry. Immediately replied: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Viscount Pound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For him and his Family, what do you know?" Kline asked for a professional attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miller thought: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don’t know much, I only know that they are The title obtained in the 'Oath of the Oath' has had a remarkable time, but decades ago, I did not know why I suddenly lost. I lost the heirs in succession. I can only find relatives of the side to preserve the title, and the new Viscount is a. Oh, in short, he squandered most of his family property and was reduced to a baron by the king. He should still be in Beckland, but he may go bankrupt at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The war of oath? The war of vows that began in 738th in the fifth century? The graduated history department student Klein recalled the corresponding knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war more than 600 years ago was a war involving religion. The Kingdom of Fenetport in the South originally believed in the Mother Earth and knowledge. With the god of wisdom, but under the influence of certain factors, the two churches have a serious confrontation, and believers often conflict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two neighbors to the north, the kingdom of Lun and the kingdom of Intis at that time seized this opportunity, excused to protect freedom of belief, opened the war, and later The Sark Empire joined in an attempt to undermine the plots of Lun and Intis, but still failed to reverse the situation and suffered a defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the war is that they are located at the junction of Luen and Fenetport, and at the junction of Intis and Fenetport, Rumburg, Mathi, The countries such as Segal were independent and dominated by the god of knowledge and wisdom. Only the Mother Earth Church was left inside the Kingdom of Fenet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because both sides of the war have accused the opponent of abandoning the "sacred vows" at the end of the Quaternary, this five-year conflict has been called "back The oath of war." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the North Continent has had more than 300 years of peace, which is not to say that there is no conflict between countries, but there is no longer such a large scale. The war, which continued until Roser invented the steam engine, improved the sailboats and artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what is recorded in the history textbook... Now think about it, since the faith is involved, there must be some extraordinary people in the church, and there must be an intense explosion in the dark. The extraordinary war... However, at that time it was said to be an era of extraordinary and rare, the number of extraordinary people is not much... small team battle? The Pound family suddenly fell down decades ago, losing the heirs in succession. Will it be related to the discovery of the ancient building on the ground? Klein asked thoughtfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I don't know." Miller shook his head slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein asked a few more words and saw that he could not get more information, so he left and returned to No. 15 Minsk Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, nearly half past five, the sky is dark and dark, just like the night, Klein thought that the public libraries should have been closed, so temporarily the underground construction things Put it down and prepare dinner for yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally wanted to learn the Fanetette face according to the recipes in the newspaper, and the result was a noodles mixed with meat and sauce. Not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having enough to eat, Klein throws coins at hand, whether divination should be alarmed, and got an answer that should not be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland in the night is as quiet as other cities, at least Jowood The district is like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was sleeping very fragrantly, ambiguously squatting in different dreams. Suddenly, he was amazed and deeply aware that he was dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is someone invading my dreams? Kleinke suppressed the frowning impulse and pretended to look around in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found himself in a hot yellow desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky suddenly came a cry, a huge monster in black and gold soared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster has a stout lizard-like body with a pair of broad wrap wings behind it, which is getting lower and lower, covering the sun in the sky . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dragon! Powerful dragon! Klein saw the scales of the size of the dish, saw the huge mouth with pure light, and saw two dark gold mullion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吼! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dragon spits out the light, covering all the light, and the vast desert is annihilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light, a figure jumped into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is three or four meters high, but he doesn’t have a giant vertical eye. He has a handsome, young face and his body is splashed. Bloody black full body armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This giant-like knight waved a broad sword from the bottom up, countless blue and white purple flames condensed into a gun, and shot it densely The dragon, he seems to have a whole army of illusory extraordinary people in the fight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meteor fire, the giant knight jumped to the top of the dragon and made a slashing action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image of the road that he had dragged out instantly overlaps, and the sword light becomes the lightning of the intersection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is shaking wildly, the dragon has fallen, and the blood is dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the picture suddenly changed, showing a bloody door, the bloody gate that Klein saw in the oldest building in the afternoon. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the bloody door opened a gap, allowing people to glimpse a black high-back chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on a high back chair with a normal size man, he lowered his head, quiet and dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angle of view is getting closer and closer, Klein sees the man’s dress clearly. He seems to be the knight who killed the dragon just now. He is still wearing Bloody black armor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference is that he is no longer three or four meters high. At this moment, the man suddenly raised his head, and there was a terrible trace of rot and bone on the young and handsome face, and his eyes were cold. And ruthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
