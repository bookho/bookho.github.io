			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Klein’s question, Dunn looked out the window to the corridor of the “Chanis Gate” and took out his own pipe and stuffed it with tobacco and mint leaves. Then put it on the nose and sniffed a deep sigh. The voice sighed slightly and flusteredly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only at home, I can enjoy tobacco and mint leaves with impunity Mixed wonderful taste... Klein, do you know the creation myth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, when I accept the enlightenment at the church Sunday school, it is by night. Revelation recognizes words, in which both the 'Wisdom Book' and the 'Sacred Letters' mention the creation myth." Klein recalled that the original Lord became a fragmentary memory, slowing down the speed, "The Creator Woke up in chaos, broke the darkness, created the first dawn, and completely integrated into the universe, transforming into the universe, his body became the earth, became the star, his eyes became the sun, and one turned into the red moon. Some of his blood rushes into the sea and the river, moisturizing and nurturing life... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Klein did not consciously pause, half because of the vagueness of the related memories, and half because of the creation mythology and the Pangu era of the big food people. It’s a bit like...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imagination of people of different worlds in myths and legends has something in common! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Klein encountering a "difficulty", Dunn smiled and added to him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "His lungs are turned into elves; his heart is turned into a giant; his liver is turned into a tree; his head is turned into a dragon; his kidneys are turned into feathers; his hair is turned into a dead bird; The ear is turned into a demon wolf; his mouth and teeth are transformed into a heterogeneous; his remaining body fluid is turned into a sea monster, the essence of which is Naga; his stomach, his small intestine, the evil part of his body, and the devil Evil spirits and all kinds of unknown evils exist. His spiritualization is the eternal sun, the master of the storm, the god of knowledge and wisdom..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He Humanity was born in the wisdom, this is the first period, the chaotic era." Klein spoke the last sentence, and the heart was funny and ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a keyboard folklorist, he was the first to come into contact with the "arrangement" of such a detailed creation myth, detailing each of the top races Which part of the creator has evolved has been detailed and subtly listed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like sitting in a row and eating fruit...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and more than the story of the goddess of the night As the text says, the Church of the Lord of the Storm, the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery has a similar description. It does not raise itself alone, and devalues ​​the rest of the gods...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This either Explain that the creation myth is a true fact, or vaguely reveal that several churches reached pre-historic times, and before the fifth century, after a long struggle and compromise, they finally reached an agreement...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein suddenly had another question, and frowned slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think this has some problems, why is it eternal, The Lord of the Storm, the God of Knowledge and Wisdom is born directly from the spirit of the Creator, and the goddess is not?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the prehistoric record of The Revelation of the Night, The goddess of the night did not wake up until the end of the Second Age, and together with the gods of the storm, the eternal sun, and other gods, blessed and helped humans through the Cataclysm, that is, Tertiary said, "catastrophe era." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mother Earth God and the God of War also appeared in the same period. The "Steam of Steam and Machinery", formerly known as the "God of Craftsman", was born in the Quaternary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, the status of the gods seems to be self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is more ancient and who is more orthodox, very clear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has caused some confusion among the believers of the Night Goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn Smith held the pipe with his other hand and did not answer: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have completely recited the goddess's name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had the feeling of inserting himself a knife, and he racked his brains and tried to recall: Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a goddess who is more noble than the stars, longer than eternal, is also the lord of blush, the mother of occult, the queen of embarrassment and fear, sleep and silence Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, fortunately, Kline’s mother is a devout goddess of the night goddess. When she was alive, she would come to dinner every evening and every day, even if the memory of the original Lord became fragmented, it would not be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does the Lord of the Blush symbolize?" Dunn asked in a guiding tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red Moon." When Klein finished speaking, he seemed to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which red moon is the creator which part of it?" Dunn smiled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A single eye!" Klein smiled at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no worse than the Lord of the Storm formed by the spirit of the Creator! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Mother Earth and the God of War, the church should have a similar statement. Only the god of steam and machinery is "born" too late to find a reason - Their church has remained weak for more than a thousand years, until the steam engine was invented and seized the first hand before it truly stood side by side with others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teng Enmo is holding a pipe:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Human being born from the wisdom of the Creator, so own A clever and extraordinary head lacks other magical powers. However, from the creation mythology, we can get a simple and clear conclusion that all things are born in the same place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same origin..." Klein repeated the last few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to this conclusion, human beings who confronted giants, demons, and aliens under the blessing of the gods gradually explored the way to obtain extraordinary power, that is, Evil spirits, using dragons, using monsters, using magical trees, flowers or crystals corresponding parts, matching the rest of the materials, preparing into potions, and then taking absorption, mastering different abilities, this is common knowledge of all mysterious schools." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun did not make too many descriptions, only a brief introduction, "In the process, our ancestors relied on painful lessons to find out if taken directly High-quality, super-conventional potions, it is easy to get the end of the tragedy, the result is only three possibilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which three?" Klein curiously asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, mental death, physical breakdown, every flesh and blood becomes a terrible monster, and second, the power contained in the potion instantly changes personality. Become cold, sensitive, irritable, cruel, indifferent to everything, the third thing..." Dunn put down the pipe, picked up the porcelain cup next to him, and took a sigh. "Fermer coffee in the Pas Valley, it is bitter but It's also very fragrant, the aftertaste is great, do you want a cup?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I prefer the plateau coffee of Fenetport, of course, I am only in Welch The family has been drinking a few times.” Kline politely refused, “What is the third?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Insanity, madness on the spot, devil than the devil, this is out of control Dunn added an accent on the word "out of control." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the time of Klein’s opening, he put the coffee cup and continued:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The experiment and exploration, coupled with the birth of '亵渎石板', humans have finally perfected the potion system, forming a series of step-by-step, stable growth of the sequence chain, the lower the sequence number, the higher the magic drug rank, to today, seven The big churches each have at least one complete sequence, and there are hundreds of years, less complete 'paths' collected over thousands of years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Sky slate?" Klein keenly captured the term. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "party", "upside down" also mentioned it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the "downside down", the slate is the most critical factor in the formation and integrity of the potion system! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the same as Dunn’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is something that some evil spirits have come up with, in which era, what is recorded, what is special, I am not too clear if you have found The clue must be reported to me immediately, and it has the highest level of response.” Dunn vaguely explained, “I just mentioned one of them out of control, and now I am talking about the remaining four.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Klein left the "slate" problem behind and focused on listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
