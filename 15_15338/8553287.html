			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bleak moonlight, Klein opened the quilt and climbed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a diviner, the emphasis on dreams is the most basic accomplishment, and the dream just can't be explained with a simple nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wore fairly comfortable clothes and came to the front of the full-length mirror and whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I dreamt of the blood-stained door in that room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of the bodyguard slowly sketched on the mirror and replied with no expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The effect of evil spirits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will gradually weaken until it disappears."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way... Klein nodded slightly, went back to the bed, picked up the gold-shelled pocket watch, and glanced at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the time is still early, he is lying down again to sleep, this time, the dreams are separated, no more than just the experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, on Sunday morning, Klein gave himself a slap in the air to match the buttered bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kingdom of Lun, or in the countries of the Northern Continent, reading newspapers at breakfast is a must for gentlemen, and Klein is no exception. Subscribe to the "Taxok", "Beckland Post" and "Beckland Morning Post". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Government Employees Unified Examination Act is officially passed in the upper house. The first test will be held in early December. The second round will be held at the end of January next year, two weeks later. It’s the final interview... Within a week, the government will announce the positions and requirements involved in this exam and start the registration process... The reporter guessed that most of this will be in Beckland...” Klein swept the content and started The cup, drank the Xibe black tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He inevitably associates with Benson and whispers in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the end of September Passing the bill, the post was announced in early October, the registration was completed in early November, and the exam was started in early December... The schedule was very tight and unreasonable enough to see the urgency of the king and the prime minister."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it is very beneficial to Benson. He has been preparing for more than two months ahead of others. Even if he is not comparable to those who graduated from college, he will certainly be better than most others. And the positions that the elite want to seek will not coincide with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He should have no problem..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Klein wanted to draw a red moon on the chest and say that the goddess blessed him. He thought that the bodyguard was nearby and forcibly resisted the urge. After all, his claimed belief was steam. The god of machinery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eat the last bite of bread, he continues to read the newspaper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The upper and lower houses passed The proposal to establish the 'Kingdom Air Pollution Investigation Committee' allows the government to form this institution... The next month will be a crucial period for all parties to compete for membership..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “...a separate alkali industry prosecutor position was approved, with the goal of producing acid and alkali plants to minimize their pollution levels.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... ... The fifth edition does not have advertisements for the acquisition of goods by Ernst Commercial Bank. It is not necessary to consider attending the gathering of extraordinary people tomorrow night..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tingen City, 2 Narcissus Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson repeatedly read the news in the newspaper and completely forgot the bread in the plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the Unified Exam Pass passed?" Melissa wore a long black dress and looked sideways at her unusually-spirited brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspapers of the past few days have been rendering the motions passed this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson finally put down the newspaper and wiped out the black hair and slowly spit out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the two suddenly fell silent, the house was quiet, and even the knife and fork hit the plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indescribable atmosphere was broken by the kitchen servant Bella, and Benson smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is something that can be foreseen. In fact, what's more important is the previous news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?" Melissa's expression was very quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson licked his mouth and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bakerland Institute of Technology University news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will officially enroll students next year, not to do grammar and classical literature exams, mainly based on technical content, very suitable for all localities Technical school graduates and students."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melissa, I think you can try it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Melissa subconsciously retorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson interrupted her words, said with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will be more expensive than tuition Universities such as Tingen, Perth, Hoy, and Beckland are half cheaper, equivalent to Conston University of Technology in Kamihain, and there are more scholarship opportunities, Melissa, you don’t like machinery, like steam, like Is this the best opportunity for you to get in touch with more advanced and in-depth knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try it, how? Don't worry about wasting money, that Pen, the money can keep us living now without work, but we are still young, we can't define our life like this, define our life, you see, compared with a few months ago, my grammar level A lot has been improved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amount... Change the environment, maybe it will be better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that you can't bear to Tingen, I can't bear it here, um, we will come back later, but not when we are young."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa looked at the various parts of the coffee table, and her lips moved a few times:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about Narbella? ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Klein passed away, she did not want to hire a miscellaneous maid, but she could think of the misery that may occur after Bella’s unemployment, and gave up this plan. Anyway, the extra cost of 5 Süller per week is nothing to say for the Moretti family whose annuity income is at least 300 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Benson shook his head and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is still a few months, can Let Bella go ahead and find a new job. Before that, we will continue to pay her and give her the bedroom. Moreover, her cooking is much better than before. It is entirely possible to apply for a female chef, but unfortunately... Of course, the premise of all is that you can pass the entrance examination of the Beckland Technical University."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to say that Bella did not learn too long. Cooking, but after looking at the expression of Melissa's sullen expression, it forced the change of the topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't wait for Melissa to say that Benson smiled and touched his hair:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I plan to resign tomorrow and concentrate on preparing for the exam. This position is said to be mostly in Beckland. This is my goal. I hope we can go there together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa silent for a moment, finally slowly lowered her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, she put the knife and fork and picked up the napkin and wiped her mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I went to the bathroom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Benson watched his sister get up and leave the table, and the smile that had been piled on his face disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the silver-colored pocket watch with a vine pattern, glanced at it carefully, and sighed very quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the day on Sunday, Klein was busy rushing to several public libraries in the Jowood area, looking for information about Viscount Pound, but the Viscount family did not have a separate biography, nor did it cause a historian. Interest in conducting specialized research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of them are scattered in different corners of various historical materials. Klein, which has no "search" function, faces the vast collection of books and essays. I felt my head hurting for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent six hours looking through a lot of information and still couldn’t get useful information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must find someone who has extensive research on the history of the nobility, or who bribes the police department, get Pound’s current address from the Baron. He is a nobleman, and the police department must have a corresponding record. The number of nobles is not much.” Klein returned home, stood in front of the wash mirror and spoke to the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirror surface quickly outlines the bodyguard's gothic court dress and black bonnet on the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is invisible to the dagger and seems to agree with Klein’s idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then her illusory whistling sound came out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The employment is over." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, it’s been three days... Klein thought: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What clues can I get from the Pound family? Do you want to know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguard did not answer, but gently nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well... telling through Maric?" asked Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After nodding again, the bodyguards bent down and lifted the skirt and performed a ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her figure disappeared quickly, and nothing in the mirror was any special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked around and did not relax, step by step to prepare dinner and fill his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night was quiet, he went back to the bedroom and pulled the curtains. He took out the iron cigarette case and reached out to touch the "black" left by Rosago. Eyes." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of illusory smashing his mind immediately seemed to tear his spirit and destroy his thoughts. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein struggled to counter the pain that caused his head to explode, and once again saw the black thin lines that spread out in different parts of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are dense, illusory, and extend to infinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked around and couldn't find another black thin line and finally confirmed that the bodyguard had left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly let go, fleeing the negative impact, slowed down for a few seconds, and then completely returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call, you can finally go over the fog to verify the inspiration that came out before..." Klein silently said, quickly set the ceremony, Call yourself and respond to yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in the spirit state, he carried the Azick copper whistle, picked up the iron cigarette case, and returned to the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat at the top of the old long table, using his fingers to pull out the spiritual flame, burning off the bloody files in the corner and other items that are no longer needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, he opened the iron cigarette case, and unexpectedly discovered that the "black eyes" became quiet and no longer revealed madness. However, the kind of pollution that still affects the pollution is still no longer active, as if hibernating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no way to separate directly..." Klein whispered, and immediately appeared a hood on the chair opposite the ancient long table. The man in the robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same as the previous attempt to make a avatar, the man was sluggish and stiff, and at first glance it was not a real person, and he could not fool the members of the Tarot Club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
