			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the white and delicate foam of Nanwell beer was placed in front of Sherlock Moriatti, Carlson finally woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bartender is away from here, he asks in his voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein picked up the glass and took a sip, and spent a few seconds savoring the malt aroma and the faint return of the bitterness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheers!" He looked at Carlson sideways and smiled and raised the cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson shook his head and refused his invitation without hesitation, and muttered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You are beer, mine is a strong distilled liquor, not suitable for a toast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein itself is just a look, once again smashed Nanwei Beer, look ahead, hehe laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want very simple.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I don't know what will be in the mausoleum, so I can only describe it more vaguely. Um... I hope to pick one from the harvest of your exploration of the tomb. I am not greedy. It does not involve high-level items. Even if it is true, I dare not ask for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you haven't found anything, or there are only high-level things, then I don't want anything. Of course, I believe that the latter happens when you I will definitely not give me a cash, which is in line with my contribution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After knowing the Amon family’s tomb from Miss Sharon yesterday, he There is a rough plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first option is to blow the copper whistle, contact Mr. Azke, join hands with the other side and explore the mausoleum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are many potential problems with this program. One is how much strength Azick is still looking for, and Klein is not clear. Second, Azick is being pursued by the military affairs, and it is easy to bring trouble to the other party and himself. Third, Klein’s high probability will re-enter the line of sight of the seal “0-08”. Of course, he has considered With the help of fog to complete the contact and exploration possibilities, but the copper whistle above the fog to summon the courier can not kill the follow-up idea. More importantly, Klein did not dare and did not want to expose the secrets above the fog to Azick Aegis, whose identity was unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he finally chose the second option, which is to use the identity of the informant, hand over the information to the "heart of the machine", and ask for the corresponding , reasonable compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are more high-ranking people, will there be more power than the seven churches? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Klein, there are nearly ten high-ranking strongmen in the Church of the Night God, that is, 13 Archbishops and nine senior deacons have Nearly half reached or exceeded Sequence 4, which did not count the leader of the goddess, the Pope who took charge of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church of the God of Steam and Machinery, even if it is not as good as this, will not be much different, they are the Archbishop of Bakerland, Horamick Haydn It is a strong bit sequence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this kind of well-established orthodox church, the things in the sequence are not very, very, very valued, Klein thinks that they have organically talked about a reasonable "price". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, the core elements of the second program are:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having difficulty finding an organization ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the price quoted by Klein, Carlson snorted for a second and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Are you not a believer in God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been living in the heart of the goddess... Klein painted a triangular emblem on his chest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is because of the belief in God that I tell you this news, not through Mr. Stanton to the night.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God said that self-improvement will make him strong. Only when I become stronger and have more money, can I reach more channels and have more resources to provide you with better and more effective intelligence." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to convince the "heart of the machine", he specially turned over the "Steam and Machinery Code" that was bought and decorated before the morning, and found a few matches. The quotations of the gods of demand are carefully carried over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlson couldn’t refute, stay there, forget to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw it and made a compliment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this is good for you to build Harmony and efficiency in the new era of informant relationship, as long as you publicize the rewards I get, and your commitment to the promise, there is no remorse, I believe that other informants must be deeply moved, greatly motivated, try their best You have collected useful information.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I want to use my pseudonym for publicity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlson listened with a sullen look, picked up the glass, took a swig, and almost reached it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, Sherlock, the real you are totally different from the one I had before. He lamented a sentence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherlock. Moriarty in his memory, good at analysis and reasoning, extremely calm, extremely polite, and full of justice The land provides very effective advice and is an outstanding believer of God.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the other party...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Klein drank a beer and smiled low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone has a different face, and it is easy to make mistakes by replacing the whole face with a single face. This is a problem that must be paid attention to when reasoning. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson calmed down for a moment and stood up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no power to promise similar I will report it immediately, you are waiting here for a while. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Klein waved to the bartender and added a fried potato grid.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he slowly finished eating food and drinking beer, the deacon of "Mechanical Heart" Constance Bernard returned to the bar with Carlson.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your request is no problem, but it must be added, that is, there are strong side effects and Items with cursed effects are not in the ranks of the selection. "Icons looked around and saw no one around, and he said quietly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want is the material... Klein immediately laughed:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I take the liberty to ask again, is this your personal decision or the response from the top?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I have the right to make such a decision." Icons pressed his fluffy hair with a hat. "But because it involves the Quaternary aristocratic tomb, I have a telegraph to the Archbishop. He did not have a call back. "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein once again painted a triangular emblem. "I will tell you the information now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons shook his head as he subconsciously. He looked around and pointed to a billiard room:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This deacon who is always called the public opinion of Arrods is still very sophisticated... Klein swears, followed by Icons and Carlson Enter the billiard room and make sure there are no ones in the left and right rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein paused for a few seconds, discretion: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things are like this, extraordinary Found a hidden mausoleum at the river bay of the River Stafford in White Cliff, and explored the periphery to find some items.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Afterwards, they Recruiting people and doing further exploration, no one will come back again. If you go there and look for it, you will find the corresponding traces. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons listened carefully and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you confirmed to be a Quaternary aristocratic tomb?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The peripheral items can prove to be members of the Amon family of the Tu dynasty." Klein answered truthfully and reminded him that "the extraordinary person who died inside is not weak, and the number is quite large, I think This mausoleum cannot be explored below the high sequence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amon..." ICONSER instincted his brows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that as a deacon, he has the authority to know some ancient secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for Klein to emphasize again, he raised his gaze:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will collect first The corresponding information will be taken again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Quaternary aristocratic mausoleum is very dangerous. Don't tell this information to others, or explore it yourself, otherwise you And your friends will only lose their lives. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I dare, I won't be sitting here... Klein laughs and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "My credibility has been good. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reaching the deal and watching Icons and Carlson leave, he put on his hat and walked slowly to the "lucky" bar.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the great aristocrats of the Quaternary, for the Amon family, the "mechanical heart" is still very cautious, they have to prepare for at least a few days to start action... cautious... Klein's arbitrarily divergent thinking suddenly settled on a word.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered another thing that was enough to be considered cautious:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Russell joined the ancient organization suspected of "Twilight Hermitage", in his secret diary written in Chinese, he never mentioned the name of the other party, and each time he used the corresponding The characteristics are referred to.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a cautious and suspicion phenomenon!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did Russell the Great dare not mention the name of the organization, even if he did not dare in Chinese? This is not the same as the style in his diary. ...what is he afraid of, what are he worried about? Is it just to say or write the name of the "Twilight Hermitage", regardless of the language, they will be known to them? A member of them or a seal of possession There is a similar ability? Klein has come up with a guess, but it has not been confirmed unless he is willing to take the risk to try.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first assumption is true, and I am not by them Perception, because the "Psychic" desire apostles are above the fog, telling Miss "Justice" is also responding to prayers with the help of fog... Well, it’s Monday again, I have to remind the Tarot Miss Justice, let her not say or record the name "Twilight Hermitage". As for the reason, give her a look and let her understand it... Klein soon had follow-up arrangements and strode away from the "lucky" "Bar".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the time is too early, took the carriage directly to the Cragg Club, intends to spend the afternoon there.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just entered In the hall, he saw the equestrian teacher Tallim Dumont.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This noble descendant sat in the corner, holding a glass of scarlet wine, his face was ruddy, Spiritually excited.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talim, your mood seems to be very good. Klein screamed with a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talim laughed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Because the New Year is coming. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he asked with excitement: "Sherlock, do you know the true taste of a person?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Klein reveals a smirk:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I am still single. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's a shame, okay, I have to go busy." Talim drank the rest of the wine and got up and waved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, thank you for introducing Mr. Flemish Cage." "Klein remembered the investment in the bicycle project and sincerely thanked him. "When are you free? I want to invite you to take me to taste the food of Beckland. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
