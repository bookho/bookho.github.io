			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information provided by "Sun" exemplifies some representative subordinate gods in detail, but most of them do not have real names, only the title is written. Including the "beautiful god" attached to the vampire ancestor Lilith, "Goddess of Life", attached to the "Goddess of Doom" of the Devil Wolf Fregra, "God of the Undead", attached to the "Lucky" of the Elf King Sonia Sorem God, "Queen of the Scourge", etc., etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of the Scourge... Klein Horan thought of the book of Scourge, and thought of the gold wine glass he had taken from the ruins of the upper elves, engraved on it. The name of Chisham and the elf language word of "natural disaster". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him have to make associations, suspecting that Hirschnam is the demon god of the Elf King, "Queen of the Scourge!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, you can’t seek confirmation from the little “Sun” and wait for him to provide further information... Klein silently sighs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he made some guesses about the fact that these titles do not have a real name:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Silver City was originally the "silver country" ruled by the giant Wang Ting. In addition to having a good understanding of its own power and the opposite of the enemy, the information of the rest of the ancient gods is more from the rumors, not so detailed, and compared to the easy-to-understand title. The real name of a complicated mouth is obviously harder to remember and more difficult to spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation after the page was turned over initially confirmed Klein’s judgment, but it caused him new doubts:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon family also has a "wisdom of wisdom" equivalent to the gods in the silver city mouth, named Herabergen, and under the giant king Olmir, and his eldest son, "Dawn The god "Bad Haier, and his queen, "the goddess of harvest." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there a real name for the "Goddess of Harvest", isn't he the queen of the giant Wang Ting? Silver City should not be undocumented... These so-called subordinate gods are equal to the later angels or the king of angels? Well, sequence 2 of this pathway, sequence 1 of other pathways? Klein was incomprehensible and inferred the actual situation. He relied on the knowledge recorded in the "Big Card". In the same route, there is no sequence 1 in sequence 0, no sequence 0, and at most three sequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Klein did not dare to make a positive judgment based on this. After all, his knowledge is still one-sided. He himself is not clear that it is due to the extraordinary character and the conservation. Whether the sequence 0 and sequence 1 details of the law have preconditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being, think... Klein leaned back and let the information in his hand disappear, smiling and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "downside down" Alger is still seriously reviewing himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After considering the question of how to communicate, he used empathy to look at the perspective of the "hidden" lady who is suspected of "stars above" What circumstances have been specifically exposed by myself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The protection of Mr. Fool’s true identity for each member is an image blur and distortion, but this does not affect the expression of color, closer Brown, brown, etc. are really difficult to distinguish, and the vivid colors can still be grasped. At least I can clearly know that Miss Justice is a blonde with a bright green...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"And the feature that I most obviously can't cover is dark blue hair, but nothing can be said. A common variation of the 'sailor' approach is that there is no problem with dark blue hair, which in turn is not established because of this The characteristics are heritable. In the island of Sonia, in the violent sea area of ​​Desi Bay, where the original elves gathered, many people with light elves have the same dark blue hair. Oh, the storm church is more than certain. The same is true for the number of areas...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without combining other characteristics, it is difficult for the 'hidden' to infer further information from this situation."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Al Just pine air, suddenly swept into the corner of my eye of the storm himself robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning to the "Blue Avenger", his identity, besides being the captain, or the bishops of the sailors, must always wear the appropriate costumes to hold the mass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Storm Church is always wary of those members who have been drifting on the sea for a long time, because it may become a pirate to play the pirate for a long time. Anyway, the "Lord of the Storm" never dropped the gods and excluded the pirates from the believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the vague and distorted cover, the details of the clothes are hard to see clearly, this is not a problem... However, I will pay attention to it later, when the Tarot party For a set of clothes with no special features... Although it is not certain, it still has to be treated as a pirate general. It can't be taken care of... "Inverted people" Alger cautiously thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he heard the "moon" Emlin seems to be pressing the voice, but it is difficult to open the mouth:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. 'Inverted Man', I am ready, when can you get the legacy of the bloody baron? You mentioned it last time, it is in the hands of a big pirate?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don’t have to make up the next sentence... Alger’s body suddenly froze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big pirate... "The hidden person" Jia Delia's gaze swept the "downside down man" again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger's expression has not changed, sideways responding to the "moon" road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You get Cash?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course!" Emlin was on his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally wanted to wait until the three-month period of the draft was full and then go to the bank to redeem, but soon found himself decided to buy the bloody baron heritage, the mood before It’s totally different:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer doubts, no hesitation, full of expectation, full of desire, can’t wait to get it right away, as in the past when you had enough money to buy your favorite status! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He endured for more than a week and finally could not restrain himself. He sold the acceptance bill and sold it out. Although he lost some money, he could still accept it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In many cases, acceptance bills can be used in currency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will get it for you this week. Finally, we will confirm the price, £4,500, no problem?" Alger sees the deal soon Achieved, did not pursue the "moon" just leaked his own situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin thought about the dolls in his room, cleared his throat, and said with a sigh of relief:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, is it cheaper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not something I can decide, but I can help you fight for it again, and, Don't forget my commission, a little less, how about 300 pounds?" "The hanging man" Alger's tone did not change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." "Moon" Emlin quietly vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too strong a vampire, underage or just a grown-up... "The Hidden" Jade Liya silently watched and made a judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transaction between Mr. "Right Hanger" and "Moon" has been reached in a few words. "Justice" Audrey habitually feels that it should be bought. what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a week or two I will contact the members of the "Psychological Alchemy" in East Chester, telling me that I have become a "psychologist" They, and through the contribution in exchange for the follow-up potion formula, there is no need to buy it here for a while... I know what materials are needed, and then ask for help... The magic items can not be bought anymore, have already reimbursed one... too Too often get such a rare thing can explain many problems in itself... Audrey thoughts turn around and have an idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned half body and looked at the gloomy man at the bottom of the bronze long table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Mr., have you mentioned the clues about the leftover characteristics of the 'psychologist', have you succeeded?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I plan to buy it back to feed Su Shi... she Silently added a sentence in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when she thought about it, she had another slightly narrow-minded idea, that is, to make an excuse to let Mr. "fool" put the "black emperor" on his hand side. The card turned over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
