			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the Red Rose Manor, Klein took his cane and walked down the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the red uniform soldier standing at the door, he closed his eyes and kept himself calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the suspected "0-08" seal has been making coincidences, preventing a woman wearing a sapphire ring from meeting me, then today is no exception. Don't worry too much about meeting her, as long as I can rely on the performance to deceive Prince Edsack, then there is no problem... Klein thoughts, and walked to the entrance of the manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After handing over the gun bag and the revolver, he searched under the guidance of the man servant, passing through the gray stone slab road, bypassing the spraying of clear spring water The pool, enter the main house, come to the second floor, and arrive outside the room where the layout should be the sun drying house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, Klein always carries a heart, afraid of encountering an accident, fearing that the situation will develop in the worst and worst direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚, after tapping the door, the servant leaned in front of the door and lowered the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Moratti's detective is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quiet for a full ten seconds, a thick voice came out of the room:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness invites him to come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this sentence is the open door, warm The feeling of distraction is better than the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the attention of the two tall guards, Klein embarked on a warm yellow thick soft carpet with patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a few steps forward, bypassing the log cabinet on the inside and outside, and saw Prince Edessack sitting by the French window and enjoying the Baekeland The sun that is rare in winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mellow face that feels intimate and impressive does not have the slightest smile, naturally creating a serious and calm atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the combined effect of the elegant fireplace and the metal pipe, the room is warmer than the end of spring, Prince Edsack does not wear a jacket, the upper body is only cuffed like a flower Blooming white shirts and light yellow vests, with accessories such as sleeves, collars, badges, etc. are not conspicuous, but expensive enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Klein sighed with a sigh of relief, because the girl wearing a sapphire ring did not accompany the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he hurried forward and took a gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edsac held a cup of hot black tea in his hand and did not ask Klein to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He maintains his expression, and asks in a deep voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a result of the investigation?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, my divination, my psychic, my visit, my exploration, tell me that Talim is a sudden heart disease "Klein replied with a clear self-reproach in his face. "In any case, I am too weak, Prince, you should ask for a stronger and more powerful helper."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You still please Gaoming... He silently added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, Edsack seems to see the face of Sherlock Moriatti’s detective, only to feel that the other person is older than before, like It’s been a long time since I couldn’t sleep peacefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not his illusion, because before Klein went out, he used the ability of "no face" to fine-tune the face and make the skin look dry and dull. Let the messy beards that are not in the whole appear a little bit, making the bags bigger and darker and more obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed Sack was silent for a while, putting down the white porcelain cup with gold thread in his hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I know, it is still too strong...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok! Klein clenched his fist in his heart and quickly took out a stack of folded paper from his pocket:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Your dear Prince, you don't need to wait. I have always had the habit of writing records."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a waiter who had taken the investigation report, and Prince Edsack flipped it over and put it aside:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have anything else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, my Royal Highness, please allow me Asking for the fare, the amount, yes, I will go to the South for a while, I want to use the warm sunshine there to melt the pain in my heart." Klein lamented the response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the New Year’s habit of many Lunes." Prince Edsack gently daggered and turned to look at the old butler Finkel. "You send Morrie." Yadi detective went out and sent a carriage to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Rose Manor is 15 to 20 minutes walk from the nearest town, where to get hired Go to the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, His Royal Highness the Prince." The old housekeeper muttered meticulously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not relax his vigilance and rushed to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed the old housekeeper all the way to the entrance to the manor, took back his gun bag and carry-on weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than a minute, he got on the carriage of the Red Rose Manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back against the wall, looking at the manor outside the window, getting smaller and smaller, Klein relaxed, slowly vomited, let The "heart" returns to its original position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands that he has left the center of the stage at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, just bid farewell to Beckland, go to the South, and completely call the curtain... After that, change face and lurk back... He calmly thinks about the follow-up plan . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he was inspired and the spirit was tight. He saw the door of the carriage open quickly and silently closed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he responded, a figure quickly outlined, wearing a heavy black dress and wearing a sapphire ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapphire ring! Seeing this scene, Klein’s pupil, who was about to attack or jump, shrank and sat back again, not dare to act rashly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a horror with a “0” seal or a semi-god at this level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...is really afraid of what comes... "0-08" or something else, what happened to you? Klein’s spirit and body were instantly tense, and he watched the figure appear completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s age is very different from her dressing style, which is 18 or 9 years old, her face is slightly round, her eyes are slender, and her temperament is gentle. Sweet and hidden, it is an excellent beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She...Klein first glimpsed and immediately recognized the other person and blurted out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tris!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn't that the one who changed from "teacher" Tries to "witch" Terry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did she become a woman of the prince? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was she mixed with Prince Edsac as a member of the witch sect? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And also with a "0" seal or the same level of magical items! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful again, he found that Terry had a certain change with the previous ones. The five senses that are not good enough are more delicate and delicate, and the combination is more touching. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tearing his awkward words, Terry is not surprised, showing a sweet smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I know you know me!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" A detective with extraordinary ability must pay special attention to the various orders! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, amount, she is very happy... Klein asked with suspicion in caution:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly remembers that the other person is not a kind person. Tries created the "nickname" tragedy by teaching, and Terry is in Tingen. Let many innocent civilians die in advance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry snorted and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as possible, you will report to the night, the punitive, the mechanical heart! Let them come here to catch me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Own the police to catch yourself? This, the shemale, the amount, this woman is crazy? Klein listened a bit stunned.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, he tasted the meaning of it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrys would rather be locked behind the door of Chanis, not willing Staying at Red Rose Manor, she is working hard to get out of here!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, she thinks it’s more dangerous than being caught by the night punishers. More desperate... Klein tried to control his expression, and asked in a deep voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you afraid of? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry stayed for a second and immediately opened her eyes, and the blind man said without a focal length:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Someone is manipulating my life, there is always a coincidence that makes me horrified afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I am less and less like myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of her, she The corner of the mouth is upturned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you imagine? I like those who are shy and lovely maids, always find themselves awake from the arms of a naked man in the morning Come, can you imagine this kind of pain?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can, so stay away from the “Assassin” and stay away from the “Witches”... Klein couldn’t help but imagine Such a scene, a moment of chills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry continues with a seemingly self-deprecating smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought I was working hard to improve, When you become 'happy', you can get rid of that weird state, so please ask me to collect the corresponding extraordinary materials, and the result is even more serious.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sometimes, I will forget a lot of things, but they really happened. I resisted nausea and lured Tallim. I wanted him to help me escape. Who knows, I don't know when to kill with a curse. He... Do you believe that there will be such a thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, they also changed my name, let me completely abandon my past, no! Never!<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They thought that I could only overcome the coincidence in a short time, and I will soon return to the right track. Oh, this is the illusion that I deliberately created for them. So, I saw you, Mr. Detective. ! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy"...Women...Material...Klein Horan remembers a past event, that is, in the "eye of wisdom" Mr. Eisin In the extraordinary gathering organized by Stanton, some people bought the main material of the "Happy Witch" pharmacy. He had the recipe and he was on the spot, but he did not take care of it, and he gradually forgot the matter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out to be Terry's helper! At that time, she was at the side of Prince Edessack? Why do I think that she is laughing so beautifully now... "Happy "Poisonous... Klein took a breath and his thoughts were cluttered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finishing his thoughts, he asked at random:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did they change your name into? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
