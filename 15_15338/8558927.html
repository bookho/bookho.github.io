			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, Amyrius and Auston Levitt, what they are planning, has led to the warning of the "Twilight Hermit"...not Really changing the times and affecting the key points of history, this ancient and secret organization will not come out at all, even if it does not reveal its identity... Klein stands on the edge of the magnificent castle in the dream, thoughtfully looking at the blurred figure just disappeared The place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a mixed mind, he suddenly realized a bit, and he was no longer so sure about the guess:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Admiral Amyrius and his brother's plan may not really affect the trend of the times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the "Twilight Hermitage" only interferes with major issues in this area, as the leader of a hidden organization, Klein clearly knows that similar organizations except Practicing its own purposes and concepts, there are also mutual help among members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the diary of Russell the Great, it can be seen that the "Twilight Hermit" has members of different sequences and different positions in different fields, except for some frenzied beliefs at the beginning. The creator, waiting for the evening to come, the true God wakes up, and the rest have their own interests. In this case, as long as the organizer does not strictly control from the beginning, the internal commission will inevitably appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, the things that Auston Levitt planned will only affect a member of the 'Twilight Hermitage', who was noticed in advance and made an internal commission. Let other members use the 'trend of the times' as an excuse to warn Amyrius Levitt...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From this logic, the hidden things are a bit interesting. ... With the personality of the 'Twilight Hermitage', only the 'weaver' of the sequence 4, Amyrius, is a target that can be removed less difficult. I even suspect that they can send more than three angels, better than the seven. Church...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, why not just do it directly, but also to give a warning in advance?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "At the time of Beckland, there must be an angel. Maybe one of the true gods will come. Therefore, the 'Twilight Hermitage' has to deal with the Duke of Nigan in a more roundabout and less conspicuous way, but here is the Austrian Ravi Island, even the high sequence is not resident...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warning Because 'Twilight Hermitage' advocates privacy, is not willing to expose itself, try not to use fierce means, or is the member who is internally commissioned not wanting to see Amyrius died? For 'He', this admiral is quite useful , reluctant to give up, even if the other party may participate in actions that are unfavourable to 'he'?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 'his' real identity seems to be able to define several ranges... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein boldly assumed that there was no way to prove it, and he could only temporarily let go of this matter and leave it behind.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the "Twilight Hermit" warns that Admiral Amyrius has nothing to do with me... as long as I don’t do anything in the past few days, I will be able to successfully end the commission. How will it develop in the future, it has nothing to do with me! With my current rank, the investigation of the "Twilight Hermit Society" is still too far away, and is not qualified to spy on anything... Klein follows his inner will and turns to examine his own Tarot Yes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I Now there is a problem. Other secret organizations are based on the practice of their own purposes and concepts. They have mutual help between members. And our Tarot will be powerful. Only trust each other, no purpose and philosophy... No, Some members have the purpose and philosophy in mind. For example, the 'moon' classmates believe that this is an organization born for salvation..." "The Fool" Klein laughed and quit the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smashed the fake eye and pushed the real eye back into place, the movement was very smooth, and there was a pause on the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not a simple dream!" Klein frowned slightly before the aftertaste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that power is the first to try to pull him into sleep! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And I was asleep at the time, why did he still do that? The captain said that 'nightmare' can directly see the dream, it is impossible to make this mistake... ...so, the visitor just used not the extraordinary ability of the class 'nightmare', but other methods...the positioning of the spiritual world? Or, after knowing my position, the collective subconscious sea described by Ms. Dai Li directly affects My mental body?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded and laughed silently in the sigh.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Admiral Amirus certainly did not expect the warning of the 'Twilight Hermitage'.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is to hire me, change someone else, just already exposed!" I am worthy of the ‘ninth law’ spell. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of Silver, inside the round tower, belongs to the Chief Colin. In the room of the Iliad.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a call from Dairik Berg who once again saw the white hair and the scars on the cheeks. "The Devil", I was a little nervous in my heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished his greeting, Colin looked up and down:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you promoted? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am already the ‘Sun God Officer’ of Sequence 7.” "Dyrik has already registered, and it will not be hidden at this time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin's deep blue eyes are removed, seemingly inadvertently Asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a follow-up potion recipe? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earliest Dairik will definitely answer "no" directly, but now he is used to thinking before opening.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say "no", then get promoted, and lack the corresponding experience support, it will definitely be confirmed as a problem, but if you answer "Yes", the chief may let me out Redeem the items and start to train more "sun" ways to the extraordinary, which will undoubtedly prove that I lied... Dairik's thoughts turn around, sincerely said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"No. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he wants to come, the experience can be made.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin nodded abnormally and nodded :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After about two months, I will arrange a tour for you, follow the team and fix the path and ruins we used to find with Jack. Secondary cleaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope you can have more to gain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Chief Excellency." Dairik just responded and suddenly remembered the "Shepherd" elder Lojay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dawn, Klein changed clothing under Cynthia’s service. Enjoy a hearty breakfast, then take a horse-drawn carriage and enter the Olavy Naval Base in the presence of the General Guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, accompanied by the Brigadier General and the colonel, he inspected the condition of the vessel, the ammunition stock, visited the newly built training ground and retired 20 times in the past year. Bathhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used lunch at the Navy cafeteria, Klein called the officers above the major to listen to the report according to the schedule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the process, he always spread a thick black leather notebook in front of him, which contained some problems specially prepared by Admiral Amyrius. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the past few decades, because of the deduction of salary and abuse of sailors, there have been seventeen inferior soldiers in Olavi, which was promulgated in the latest regulations of the Royal Navy. After that, thanks to Admiral’s guidance, we have improved this trend. In the last three years, there has been no similar thing...” A colonel at the Olavy Naval Base stood in the same position and reported the overall situation. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up from time to time to look at Admiral Levitte and found that the Lord listened very seriously and kept taking notes, the voice of Shashasha The officers who sat in a circle did not dare to slack off, and also focused on the key points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colonel who received such a positive response, the voice of the report became unconsciously a little bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
