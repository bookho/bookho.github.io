			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened carefully and asked a question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, you suspect those detectives Did Zeriel see other people pretending?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian took his brown dome hat and replied as early as possible:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a possibility, but I think it is too difficult, high enough to take great risks, the party is at night, the lights are really not bright, can participate Most of the people are detectives, detectives with keen observation, and it’s hard to get rid of their eyes with wigs, beards, cosmetics, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps something extraordinary Ability can be done... like "squirming hunger"... Klein’s question has a small trap, trying to judge from the content of the big boy Ian’s answer, the expression of the face and the language of the body. Whether he has contacted the extraordinary, has a certain understanding of the mysterious field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial answer is no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian sees Moriarty Detective nodded slightly, agreeing with his own reasoning, and continues to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I believe that the detectives saw Mr. Zerrell, but he was not free. Under the strict control of others, he could not convey the message of help. The reason why he did not respond to my contact was to let I am alert, let me find someone to help him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A reasonable explanation." Klein let go of the hand, and then sat a little, let yourself It looks more relaxed and more confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian was silent for a dozen seconds, speaking abruptly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think Entrusting you to investigate Mr. Zerrell and confirm his current status, only need to confirm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that the other party is a semi-professional who collects intelligence and news for detectives, Klein had a heart and smiled and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How much will you pay for? You should be very clear that this may be very dangerous."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian’s action looked down at the pocket of his old coat, and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two ways. First, I will give you enough compensation directly to make you satisfied with the reward. After that, whether the task is simple or difficult, it is this number unless you are seriously injured."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second, I paid 5 pounds in advance, waiting for you to complete the commission, and then depending on the difficulty of the matter, but it is easy to cause disputes, even if there is a contract The agreement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pretended to think, after nearly thirty seconds, he said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Maybe this? You pay 5 pounds in advance, wait for the task to end, and then help me with three things. Don't worry, it won't be difficult, it's within your ability, and won't let you It feels too difficult, this can be agreed in the contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian wrinkled his brow and immediately stood up, leaning forward and extending his right hand: < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and he shook his hand and took a picture from the coffee table He had already prepared a standard contract, picked up the round pen, added all the details he had just talked about, and pressed the confirmed fingerprints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After signing the contract, he gave the big boy Ian a stack of white paper and watched the other person write the information related to the detective of Zellel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he flipped through the information and asked casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have an emergency, or confirm the status of Zherel, how can I contact you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian licked his mouth for a long time without talking until gram Ryan looked up and replied stiffly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't need to contact me, I will appear at the right time."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say much, from the pockets of the old coat pulled out a thick pile of banknotes, they seem to be superimposed in the order of denomination from large to small, Very neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian first took out three 1 pound denominations from the bottom, then counted six 5 solers, and finally 10 sheets of 1 Sule notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the other party put the banknotes neatly, even the portraits of several kings must be headed up, there can be no mistakes, and Klein suddenly has some irritability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the late stage of obsessive-compulsive disorder... He sighed in silence and took the reward from the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his visual inspection, Ian’s remaining cash will not exceed £3. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s estimated that all the savings are carried on the body... If I just asked for more compensation, will he finally escape? His appearance is not like that kind of person, but people can't look at it... Klein casually folded up the banknotes, stuffed them into the pockets, didn't manage the neatness, and he managed to see Ian's expression slightly distorted. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am trying to complete the investigation as soon as possible." Klein stood up and reached for the guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your help." Ian sincerely thanked him because the other party gave him a "discount price." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the big boy who is much older than the real age has left, Klein touched his chin and thought quietly and silently:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The water in this matter is very deep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ian never mentioned Zee from beginning to end Riel’s detective was investigating something recently, and he was told what information he was collecting...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Forget it, how much money to collect, how much to manage, I only need to confirm the current situation of Zerrell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his body and walked back to the living room, and took out a denomination of 1/4 from his trouser pocket. Penny's copper coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The copper coin rolled up, and Klein turned his eyes and wondered if there was any extraordinary factor in this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, his right hand spread out, trying to catch the fallen copper penny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! The coin ran across his fingertips and landed on the ground, rolling out of the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This result means divination failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that Ian’s concealing things are much more than I imagined... the lack of information can’t even get the vague divination results...” Klein Tightly close the lower lip, step forward, and bend over to pick up the copper coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening, in the early hours of the morning, the Beckland Bridge area No. 138. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein changed a cheap light blue worker's outfit, his mouth, chin and cheeks were covered with black beards. At first glance, there was a kind of Rough and barbaric taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wore a dark cap with a low pressure on his brim and almost covered his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hat originally belonged to the hunters of the Intis Republic, and the traditional deer hats of the Kingdom of Lun are different, but have recently become popular in Beckland. Middle and low class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden in the shadow of the Indus sycamore tree beside the road, Klein looked at the opposite house with the help of an elegant gas street lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the home of Zerel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This detective is a Southville county, parents, relatives and friends are there, he is alone in the Beckland, and gradually got some fame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still a bachelor, only hired two temporary maids, that is, the kind that he cleaned up every three days, regardless of room and board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the townhouse he rented had no light, and it was dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein untied the silver chain in the left wrist cuff and let the citrine pendant fall naturally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is danger inside.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is danger inside.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven consecutive times, he opened his eyes and saw that the spirit was turning clockwise, but the speed was very slow and the amplitude was small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is danger, not big." Klein whispered, reconfirming the items such as tarot cards, homemade spells, and Christmas powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he looked around, staring at the dead of night, agilely flashing across the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zherel’s home has no verandas, no gardens, no lawns, and directly along the street next to the road, Klein wraps around the side, along the tap Pipes, easily climb to the small balcony on the second floor to dry clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed, he pulled out a tarot card, stuffed it into the gap, and opened the door to the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Ian’s house layout, Klein’s footsteps almost silently came outside Zerrell’s bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scorned the left tooth, opened the vision, and looked through the wooden door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirit is to penetrate the invisible obstacle to see the color of the gas field, but this is closely related to its own level, Klein can now observe through the wooden door. But it is impossible to overcome the stone wall, and the sight seen will not be too clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his sight, there are three groups of people in the bedroom behind the door, the color is different, and they are in different positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always ambush three people...in order to catch Ian, or someone else? The bedroom is not big... Klein stands in the dark and calmly thinks about the results of the observation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he suddenly retreated toward the balcony, and his steps were still very light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back on the balcony, Klein took out a silver sheet from his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "Sleep Charm" he tried in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not pray to the goddess of the night, but to ritual with himself, "fools who do not belong to this era", and then responded to the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this method is difficult to mobilize the power of the mysterious space above the fog, Klein can only "respond" with his own spirituality, and finally make a spell It is worse than normal, but it is better than the one that I made in the name of "I am in my name". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing the surroundings again, Klein covered his mouth and whispered a Guhmes word:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;“绯红.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After feeling the cold, he quickly and silently moved to the door of Zerel’s bedroom again, holding the handle. The spirituality is poured into the silver sheet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! Klein carefully twisted the handle and quietly pushed the door open a gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he threw in the "Silence Charm" in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly recycling, Klein re-closed the door and began to count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"3"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"1"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed the door open and rolled on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they didn’t feel the movement of the three people, Klein stood up and began to look at the scene in the room through the blushing moonlight shining through the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a normal layout bedroom with a bed, a row of wardrobes, a desk, a set of small sofas, and a coat rack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the bed is a man in a black jacket. He is sleeping and sleeping very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
