			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Hidden" Jia De Li Ya controlled himself, did not go to see the "world" German, the voice said slowly: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the northeast of the Gargas archipelago, there is a safe waterway to enter the dangerous sea area..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She separated from The abyss cracks in the sea speak about the unseen sun chariot, the night that must be slumbered to escape, the terrible slang that fills the entire ocean, and the "Giant King Ting" projection across the mountain in the dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the process, she did not have a sentence from Tigman Sparo, deliberately avoiding bringing out the other side. As for other anomalies on the way, she only briefly talked about a few words, such as the sea where the hair of the "Goddess of God" remnants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, she focused on the ruins of the sea that slumbered with corpses and the adventurer's sailboat with the words "not old spring". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This may mean '不老泉' is in that ruin, the body that can make a huge respite is the caretaker." "The hidden person" Jia Delia said The general speculation on the "Future", but this does not equal her judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"不老泉"... "The old spring" in the legend of the six treasures on the sea... "The hanging man" Alger heard the heart and couldn't help thinking about it. The feasibility of exploring the remains after sequence 5. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey listened carefully and shook his head very small:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think the ultimate meaning of the blood word is 'not the old spring' in the ruins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a second, she tried to start the psychology of the deceased Analysis:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A person who is dying in the face of a monster attack will not do something about a treasure, if he wants to remind his follow-up companion or come to find him. His relatives, he should write more about the dangers, or the source of danger. If he is going to tell the passing ship that there is a 'no old spring', then he lacks enough endogenous power to write a similar Things, unless there is a conspiracy in it, tempting people to go to the ruins to find a plot of 'no old spring', and the conspiracy will save him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, change it to me, I will not desperately want to tell others that there is a treasure before death. What is the point for me?" "Moon" Mlin echoed and said, "Only hatred, only hatred engraved into the bone marrow, can let me write this kind of thing before dying. Otherwise, I would rather tell others how I should be buried and what funerary items I need!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, he snorted and shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein can't see the dagger, manipulate the "world", and whisper: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" '不老泉' is a scam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He uses an absolute affirmative sentence, and may not be able to wait for words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"不老泉" is a scam... 嘉德丽雅 looked at the "world" and looked back thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to confirm some of her guesses and thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger was frowned, he did not recognize the "world" judgment, or considered "justice" and "moon" "Mr.'s remarks are not reasonable, but I found that I have not considered this possibility at all!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, this is a mistake that should not be made! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... After so many years, I will still be blinded by huge benefits for a short time... He is silent for a few seconds, suddenly sighing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sharing their own experiences, everyone began to teach the little "sun" ancient Hermes, and learn some knowledge of the field of occult from each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is passing by, "Footer" Klein looks around after a tacit agreement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Just here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow your will." "Justice" Audrey immediately got up, and the skirt was swayed, and the rest of the members She is almost in no particular order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the blurred figure disappeared in front of him, Klein did not rush to leave, with a parchment and a round pen, wrote a divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I hope to advance the sequence 4."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the pen, Klein holds the parchment, leans back on the back of the chair, closes his eyes, and enters meditation State, while silently reading the divination statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven times, he quickly fell asleep and came to the world of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray world cracked open, and he saw a towering mountain peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the mountain, there is a collapsed and decaying palace, the walls are covered with weeds and moss, and there are obvious holes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall of the palace, there is a huge seat carved from stone at the top, which is inlaid with faint gold and precious stones, which are mottled and damaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not like a seat for humans, countless transparent locusts are clumped together, they are intertwined, slowly creeping, constantly Growing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a slang voice that pierces the long time and history, illusory, ethereal, and resounding:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honakis... Fregra...Honages...Fregra...Honakis...Fregra..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slang is in the ear, Klein wakes up, his face is slightly wrinkled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really is the main peak in the Hornaces And it’s clearer and clearer than ever before...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds him of the prophecy of the “Mysterious Queen” Bernard :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your destiny is the main peak of the Hornaces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is me Destiny? I just want to make people rebellious, just don't go... Hey, can't be absolutely, look at the situation... Klein sighed and presented the five "wanted orders" provided by Emlin White's guy. Some information used divination to find the whereabouts of the five "primitive moon" believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he could only determine two points because of insufficient information:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Galis Kevin, Windsor Bellin, Argos are in Beckland.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dandy and Laura are located in the port of Enmat, one in Port of Leeds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is equal to no gain... Klein shook his head and returned to the real world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Thinking of the potion formula that had promised to provide the "notary" within three days of the "Sun", he put on his coat, put on a hat, and prepared to go out and find the target.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opening the door and coming to the stairway, Klein saw Anderson Hood turning his hand to the deer hat and taking the country songs and stepping forward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This guy's mental recovery ability is very strong... It was only taught by the demigod in the morning, forced to apologize, promised, and now I can't see the shadow at all... No wonder he can become the strongest of the sequence 5, just this The psychological quality is not easy to get out of control... Kline looks at each other and gently daggers, it is a greeting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon, German . Anderson smiled and waved. "The bounty and the feature money are all available. I will give you the final payment." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said while taking out thick and thin banknotes from different pockets.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's very smooth. Klein commented without emotion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes, it is much smoother than I expected! Those guys who are supposed to be covered with granite stones in their minds are surprisingly harmonious, efficient, and polite, and I doubt whether I was taken care of by the goddess of luck! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no such god. Klein unrelentingly pierced the other's fantasies.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be so serious, life, relax, relax." Anderson handed over the 1200-pound tail. "Actually, I know exactly what is going on. It must be that the gentleman didn't want me to waste time, secretly '叮嘱' those People."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at the banknotes, pinched it with his hand, and asked casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is there a question about which pirates are involved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked what the prey brought the "manipulator" last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't confirm." Anderson smiled. "Do you think I haven't confirmed it beforehand? I don't care if you are in front of you, but actually I have investigated the background and situation of the prey in advance to avoid causing people who should not be provoked. Who knows... Hey, can only be attributed to bad luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;...... This guy is much more cautious than I thought... Also, his previous sequence was called "Conspiracy"... Kline thought for two seconds and turned to indifference: <br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is the best to kill here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson first glimpsed and immediately snorted:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our wildest adventurer is also planning to start a hunting event?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" However, you have to think about it, I don't want to find out that you are a companion when you complete the mission of the demigod. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassure, we are different, I am a diviner, I have various ways to cover up the situation, will not be brought to the door, and that is The demigod of the "audience" approach is not good at divination and prophecy... Klein maintains the unique cold posture of Gleman: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't care. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson erected a thumb:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your madness is amazing!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most killing is 'Xinlu Ensone's Mosona, one of the best friends of the pirates, possesses a highly addictive drug based on marijuana or other plants, which helped him control the Toskat government and the police. Man, is the most powerful gang leader here...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has done a lot of cases, killing a lot of people, but basically it is done with pirates, There is no problem.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, this guy is not an extraordinary person, the difficulty of killing him is trouble, right, trouble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He always has three to five extraordinary people from different pirate groups to provide protection, roof, outside the room, under the window, all his people, want If you want to kill him, you can only force yourself to kill the majority of people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have the ability to do this, but it is too much trouble, and there are certain dangers. I will become a wanted criminal afterwards, so I did not deal with him and dealt with the safe of his family. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe... Theft is so fresh and refined... Well, I heard that Toskat was mainly based on plantation economy and pirate black market trade, incidentally Prosperous in the bar, brothel and casino industry, I didn’t expect new drugs here... Mossona is an ordinary person, not an extraordinary person...just, “squirming hunger” lacks food... Klein nodded and gestured Anderson speaks in more detail.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, "Oak Bar" Inside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A boxing match is about to start in the ring, and many drunks hold cups and are surrounded by them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They seem to smell the bloody sharks, betting and shouting words such as "kill him" and "kill him"!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This is the industry of the "New Lun Party" boss Mosona. The boxing competition held is different from other places, that is, allowing the dead!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mosona is very fond of this almost ancient game, and often comes to watch a few games. Now, he is sitting on the second floor, overlooking the ring.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
