			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the outskirts of Queens, a racecourse with a wide but no audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey Hall is holding a red mare, deliberately plucking into the corner, pretending to discuss things with the Gloria Priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wears white trousers and knee-length black boots, and the upper body is a black jacket-style rider with a simple lady's shirt and waist. The same-tone protective helmet, the whole person looks very cool, has a different beauty than usual, and the golden-haired big dog Su Shi is cleverly kneeling at her feet, seems to carry a leather bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disguise of the sergeant of Gladlin’s attendant sneaked into the eyes of Audrey’s long, straight legs and unconsciously rubbed his toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Simple equestrian does not make any sense. Only when combined with hunting, it has vitality. Of course, I mean male equestrian, beautiful lady riding. No matter what the horse is doing, it is a landscape." Glylint looked at Audrey, and half of it was a half-joking joking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey returns with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are still months away from the next hunt "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year from June to New Year, the nobles of the Kingdom of Lun will come to Beckland in accordance with tradition, attending various banquets, dances and salons. This is an activity that is very important to them. Many things will be finalized in these months. As the year after year, this tradition gradually has a fixed name, called “Beckland Social Season”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the New Year, the land aristocrats will return to the land and return to their own luxuriant castles, country manors, large plantations, and spend a leisurely and beautiful time. In this time, the most popular game is hunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles will invite guests of similar identities to enjoy the horse-riding and chasing prey, and they will always buy the hound as long as the financial situation permits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most famous dog in the hound is the fox terrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have missed that life very much, Beckland is a place where people feel restrained, its air is even more unspeakable, of course, its The extravagance of the bustling city still makes me love.” Viscount Glylint put on his gloves and took a step back to facilitate Audrey and Hugh and Foals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Audrey, what are you doing here for us?" Hugh regained his gaze and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her recent big income comes from Audrey, the other is honest and trustworthy, generous and generous, is a rare good employer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seem to smell the ink scent of the banknote... Hope is not too difficult task... Miss Audrey is perfect, only a little bad, every time The tasks were all surprising and very dangerous... Hugh was expecting and thinking about it, and couldn’t help but look at Fols and look at the companion disguised as a maid to look at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expressions reflected in the dice are so similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey held a glove and held it gracefully and gracefully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time A simple commission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, she used her eyes to signal Hugh and Fols to open the leather bag on Susie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the action is strong, Hugh immediately stepped forward and stooped to explore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this short process, she originally wanted to touch the head of Su Shi to express her good intentions. As a result, the right palm just extended and Su Shi had already twisted. The head, half turned the body, and sent the leather bag to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very popular with animals...for example, mosquitoes... Hugh keeps the expression unchanged, pulls the zipper and takes a stack from the leather bag Paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up straight and opened it, and found that the above pictured a young man with a normal face, but the hair that was neatly combed, round glasses, The brown palms that sneered at the smiles made her feel very familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m sure I’ve seen it there! Looking down, I saw the corresponding text description:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used the name, Lalhous, the alleged fraudster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know where I have seen him! When I woke up, I almost realized the indecent action of taking a forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I knew Audrey, one of the main sources of her income was to read the newspapers, study the wanted orders, and use the relationship in the Eastern District in a lot of gangs. Look for criminals who are worth a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have thought about finding this Llanus, his bounty is £100, and he has swept more than £10,000 in cash! However, after the busy commission of Miss Audrey, I forgot about this matter... After taking a look at Hugh and Fols, I opened my mouth frankly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What is the amount of the commission?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount of the commission? Audrey stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She completely forgot about the matter of paying, because in her opinion, this is the examination of Mr. "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I give money to the other party? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amount...100 pounds?" Audrey gave a number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The deal!" Hugh and Folsch responded at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can catch Llanus, you can not only get Miss Audrey’s 100 pounds, but also receive the same amount of reward... It’s a good Mission! Hugh eyes screamed and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you looking for this fraudster? Did he deceive your money?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t even know who he is... It’s a simple commission, 100 pounds will be dealt with... This thing no longer has to say to Mr. Fool’s... only 100 pounds... With a polite smile, Audrey ignored the issue of Hugh and referred to it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I received the news, he was at Beckland." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, there are more than a dozen portraits, different portraits, I think that Laurus will definitely do the disguise, so he was given no Glasses, a beard, changed the portrait of the hairstyle, um... the portrait of the conjecture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also very good at sketching and painting! Audrey slightly raised her chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have forgotten the doubts just now, and said with surprise:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really a very good The news!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to have seen the 200-pound bounty beckoning to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The mysterious person I met before at Mr. A’s party has not yet established contact with her. She can only continue her own money-making business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey's invisible nod, Shen Yudao:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mental alchemy has things Is there a clue?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folry thought of his long curly hair, and looked at the Viscount Glylint, who was watching:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I recently joined a new extraordinary party, and it is said that there have been potions recipes for 'audience' and 'readers'. I suspect that there are psychology among the members of the party. Alchemists."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I have another party next time, I will apply and take you there."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Audrey deliberately did not hide her joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just read the true state of mind from Hugh and Fols’s color, body movements, and subtle expressions, thus judging their enthusiasm for the task. There is no lying in the matter of the psychological alchemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gregorian Viscount muttered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Audrey's business is about to succeed , What about my 'pharmacist' formula?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really no clue, the 'pharmacist' approach is more in the South, in the Kingdom of Fenet "False made a deep regret gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
