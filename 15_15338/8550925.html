			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early hours of the morning, the well-ventilated but quiet and deep underground, the dimly lit gas lamp is protected by the glass, stable and without swaying, shining the unmanned, peaceful aisle . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat in the duty room, arbitrarily flipping through the stacked newspapers, magazines, and books in front of him, and splitting out the small spirits to pay attention outside, guarding against someone’s swearing to Chanis door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His coats and top hats are hung on the coat rack at the entrance, and the cane is resting against the wall, in a convenient place to get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich coffee scent permeated, and Klein couldn't help but take a sip and pinch the temple to counter the heavy head and body exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he was sleeping at the university on the earth, he often slept at five in the morning, the fierce man from noon, working for two or three years, from time to time will also be a At night, I can go to work the next day, but it must be attributed to the game being too fun, the novel is so good, the film variety and TV series are too interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the world clearly does not have these day and night necessities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Russell the Great is also a good thing to install, it is necessary to put a limited life into an infinite career, to lead the people of different circles to run fast Entering the age of informationization!” Klein silently sighed and could only comfort himself, at least newspapers, magazines and increasingly rich novels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally wanted to use concentrated learning to overcome difficulties, but practice found that this contradicts its own responsibilities, because once it enters the state, it is easy to overlook the outside. Move and ignore the situation of the Chanis Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, Klein picked up the coffee cup and carefully took a sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked the scent and let the scent stick to the mouth, allowing the liquid to flow slowly through the esophagus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fermer coffee in the Pars Valley, very bitter, but very refreshing." Klein admired, put down the cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pars Valley is located in the South Continent and is a high-quality production area for coffee beans. It is currently in the midst of the dispute between the Republic of Intis and the Kingdom of Lun - they are The colonial power was established on the left and right banks of the Pars Valley, destroying the original Persian kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quietness of the heart, Klein picked up a magazine at random and found that it was the "Men's Aesthetics" that talked about clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This must have been taken from Rosanne..." He whispered funnyly and looked at it with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps due to the rapid advancement of camera technology in the last decade or so, the magazine "Ms. Aesthetics" not only uses illustrations extensively, but also imitates newspapers and uses black and white photos as content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are quite fashionable to invite famous theatre and opera actors to showcase the charm of the costumes and the magic of the match, just seven years away from Beckland The new regional magazines have been developed into mainstream journals with channels throughout the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This dress is good, looks good..." Klein looked at it leisurely and did not hide his yearning for beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a man with normal physical and mental development. He has always appreciated the beautiful girl, but he has already set goals and is looking for a way to go home. Keep a distance from the opposite sex, do not want to delay the other party, do not want to leave the debt of the relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for finding a girl on the street, he is small and clean in this respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson and Melissa are already there, they can’t be lifted, they can only make up for it in the future... Klein suddenly feels heavy and can’t help but sigh. Tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer you leave home, the more you can feel the hustle and bustle in the dead of night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He instantly lost interest in admiring the beauty of the lady, put down the magazine in his hand, and picked up a novel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Stormwinds, author, Folswall." Klein read the main content of the cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late night of tranquility, the faint yellow light, a book with a cover, reminds him of the days when he rented books as a child, so he read quite nostalgicly. Go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The novel "Storm Mountain Villa" tells the story of Ms. Yu, who is 1.65 meters tall and weighs 98 pounds, and enters the Furus Villa as a tutor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1 pound is about 1 jin... Is this the Jane Eyre of the Alien Edition?" Klein rubbed his fingers with comfortable paper for subsequent content. Have some guesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when he thought it was a romance novel, there was a "bad spirit" in the back. When he believed that this was a spiritual novel, Ms. Yu blew herself. Identity is a detective, giving a gorgeous reasoning. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein felt that this was a detective novel, there was nothing wrong with it. The man’s head was hit hard, lost his memory, and began a tearful story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...There is still a romance novel." Klein closed the book and took a sip of coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intense percussion sounded loudly, echoing in the faint and quiet corridor, echoing in the ground of almost no one else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was shocked and his spirits were tense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He instinctively took the revolver from the arm of the arm, adjusted the magazine and the trigger, and leaned back to the door to find the source of the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slap was getting more and more intense, and Klein looked at the sound and saw the black iron with seven sacred emblems on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The voice that came out behind the door of Chanis?" His eyes slammed and his heart beat like a drum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw the Chanis Gate swaying slightly and felt the majestic force it suffered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No... I just met here on the first day. Did I have a bad luck after I crossed?" Klein took hold. The right hand of the gun gave a cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But very quickly, he remembered the captain’s embarrassment: no matter what sound you heard, no matter what happened, don’t open the Chanis Gate unless it was turn on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount, is this normal? Klein calmed down a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! Dangdang! Dangdang! Dangdang! The movement behind the Chanis Gate was getting bigger and bigger, but the heavy black iron just shook the door and there was no other abnormality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s normal, scare me..." Klein whispered, and he was going back to the duty room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he heard a harsh rubbing sound and saw that Chanis Gate was heavy and broke open a gap! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zha! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sound of making people sour, Klein saw the figure almost solidified, it is about adult, ordinary man's arm height, Wearing a black, elegant, miniature court dress, the skirt has obvious stains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a face that is not so delicate, with dark eyes and tight mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a puppet, toy puppet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost the moment Klein subconsciously raised his gun, the puppet wearing a black court dress tightly and forcefully attached to the open Chanis Gate , unfolded the paper held in the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many hidden symbols on the paper, which are known by Klein and those that he has not yet mastered. Together they form a vertical eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein still has time to think about what this is, when the court puppet was suddenly pulled back to the door of Chanis, pulled back by the invisible Behind the door of Chanis! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
