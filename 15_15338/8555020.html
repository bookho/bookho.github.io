			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Kline’s explanation and relief, Allen was relieved and ready to observe for a few more days to see if he would do similar nightmares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After smiling and sending the famous surgeon out of the gate, Klein’s expression suddenly became condensed and seemed to be thinking about something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no problem with his interpretation of the dream, the dark towers, the walls and gates that were blocked, and the silver snakes, which really symbolize Will. The situation in which Thring is threatened by something symbolizes that the child is afraid of helplessness and tries to hide behind the layers of protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the crux of the problem is that this big probability is not the revelation of Dr. Allen’s spiritual autonomy, otherwise he can’t wait until last night, until he pulls out the thousand The paper crane, the dream, should have been similarly developed long before Will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Klein suspects that this dream is instilled by Dr. Allen, the medium is the thousand paper cranes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein opened the "Lingshi" carefully observed this handicraft, but did not find it has any spiritual brilliance, but his inspiration, his intuition, They all told him that there were some wonderful places in the thousand paper cranes, perhaps involving the most vain and most difficult to grasp the most worthy fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child called Will Anthony is not simple... It seems that the magic is probably not the tarot, but himself... The silver-white giant snake is a symbol of danger. This matter is related to factors such as unlucky, lucky, etc. Does it represent the "snake of mercury", the sequence of the "monster" route, "the snake of mercury"? Klein's thoughts spread out, but he was not sure of anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to analyze the question of how dreams are instilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Klein’s current mystery, this is not too complicated and too difficult to understand, and he soon has an idea:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First of all, you can rule out the influence of ghosts of ghosts, which will make Dr. Allen's gas field color light or dark or dark, and I have not found any signs of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are two ways to instill the dream master without abnormal situations. One is the extraordinary ability like 'nightmare', like the captain, relying on guidance. To achieve the goal, and not to participate too deeply, otherwise it will leave traces, and the second is more subtle and higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The principle of dreams is that the spirits of the spirits travel to the spiritual world, so that some details that are usually unconsciously noticed are transformed into symbolic meanings under external stimulation. Revelation, or, directly obtain some revelations related to themselves from the outside, and then tell them to the spiritual body, telling themselves the spirit, and since the owner is sleeping, this will appear in the form of dreams.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the second way is to instill through the spiritual world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First use some magical means to create the revelation of your own needs, and then naturally let the target's astral body get in the spirit of the spirit, feedback Going back, the goal is to dream about the scenes that others want him to dream, and there will be no traces outside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the current What I can't do, even if it is a state of spirituality that can slightly incite some power above the fog, it doesn't work. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sank a bit and added a possible guess:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Allen was hinted at by a thousand paper cranes. Once he found it, he would make a corresponding dream.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good confirmation, as long as I am against Ai Dr. Lun used "Psychic" and should be able to find the corresponding traces... But wouldn't he be less friendly with him using "Psychic" or borrow the "Heart Candle" from Father Uttraski "No, I recognize the identity of the vampire, the fanatical fan of love, Emlin White. It is not muscular, like the giant Utravsky priest... Klein retracts his thoughts and considers the next What to do.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decides to wait for the danger of divination above the fog. If it is acceptable, then I will sneak into Dr. Allen’s house tonight, using the "dream charm" "Every means to observe in secret, whether the source of the dream is direct guidance or indirect forgery.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb Sp;&nbsp;However, with the strength and level of Klein, it is quite difficult to find traces of the latter, and he does not have much confidence in himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that sitting next to Dr. Allen and doing meditation, the astral spirit can swim with him in the same spiritual world, which must be adequately positioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the description of the Book of Secrets, the existence of the spiritual world is quite wonderful, it completely overlaps with the real world, all overlap, so everyone can always Obtaining revelation from the spiritual world, but there is no distinction between the upper and lower sides of the spiritual world. The past, the future, and the present are all possible to meet here. It is like a weird ocean compressed by countless imaginary spirits of countless knowledge, and the normal concept is normal. The "world" in logic is very different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, the revelation gained from the spiritual world can only be a variety of symbols, not a direct answer, because of this, everyone’s spiritual experience Which part of the spiritual world is not only related to the location of the place where it is located, but also closely related to the current state of the body and spirit. There is no corresponding positioning method. It is necessary to lock in the spiritual world and find someone’s astral body. It is impossible to succeed, even if you are next to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, the spirit of the star spirits is also limited. It is not too deep. Once it is lost, it will not return to the body. It will become a dementia, and more serious will become a vegetative person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And want to physically enter the spiritual world, as a springboard to complete the transfer, it is even more difficult, a little careless will get lost, will never return to the real world, Until the rot died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein breathed a sigh of relief and temporarily threw the problem behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out his pocket watch, looked at the time, found himself thinking too long, the breakfast was cool, and Mike’s reporter has not come yet, this Explain that the commission will be delayed by one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spirit of not wasting, Klein finished the rest of the food, then went to the fog to make a divination, and got this thing strangely. There is no revelation of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all this, the agreed time has passed, he no longer hesitates, put on a heavy jacket, put on a cap, take the word book, and leave Minsk 15th Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His initial plan was to take a chance to give Old Kohler some hints when he was interviewed by Mike Joseph in the Eastern District, so that he would not mention that he had promised to help Li Fu find Daughter's business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Liv family, the old Kohler reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Mike has delayed things for a day, and Klein is more calm, no longer worried about mistakes and accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with the address mentioned by Old Colle, Klein obtained according to divination Revelation, entering the depths of the Eastern District, found the room on the third floor under a watchful or vigilant or alert, or numb or greedy gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two high and low beds, and some dilapidated beds on the ground, and every spare place is full of debris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked directly at the bottom bunk of the innermost bed and shouted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Old Kohler."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After brushing, Old Kohler turned over and sat down to the door with surprise:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really came. After I sent you the letter yesterday, I guess you will come to me today, so I didn't go to the dock and waited at home."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I don’t have to think about how to make a lie to explain why I came here to find you... Klein looked around and said:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Kohler, with your current income, you can rent a better room, change a better place, why just change from a ground floor to a high bed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most of the money is going to help you collect the news." Old Kohler smiled. "And I am no longer young, I have to squander some money for the body to weaken in the future." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&& Nbsp; Klein silently for two seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can consider buying some insurance, such as the 'solitude and helpless old man's rescue insurance', it can make you really When I am old, I get a weekly money that I can at least fill my stomach and sleep in the room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
