			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens, Hall of Earl, restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the usual practice, Audrey is doing pre-dinner prayers with her father, mother, and brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's be beautiful!" She clicked clockwise four times on her chest and ended up with this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, her voice did not fall, but the line of sight covered by the eyelids was filled with a thick fog, looking down on everyone’s possession. Openly and majesticly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is a Russell brand made by Russell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool"... "Big card"? Finally, Audrey, who waited for the response, was a happy first, and immediately became a little worried. He did not understand what the so-called "Big Card" meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she soon had speculation that she had always known that Russell had produced a hidden card that symbolizes certain unknown forces. This card has a total of 22 cards and is considered to be the object of the tarot card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she also heard the "downside down" said that the secret hidden in the deck is the way of God, the road to God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, it was called "Big Card"... Corresponding to "Slate"... This is definitely the top treasure in the mysterious world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Way of God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that the “fool”’s leader wants help, to ensure that the card is actually acting, so as not to make mistakes, not get the right target, but let the steam The church wakes up to a bookmark that contains the "Big Card"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know if he has succeeded...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary people of the steam church did not come to do routine inquiry, perhaps, he is still planning...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body has a tremor, Audrey saw a praying figure in the thick fog, blurring the silhouette of the pole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is respectful and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great fool, please pass me to the verifier Thanks, this makes my actions very smooth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To this end, I am willing to raise the reward to 3,000 pounds, deducted from the 5,000 pounds that have not been paid, this It is the share that the other party should get."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful? Is this successful? But when I saw the front page of those newspapers, there was no news of the theft of the exhibits. All of them were the news of the 12th victim of the serial killings... The salary was raised to 3,000 pounds, indicating that the "fool" Mr. The action was indeed successful, and he did not let anyone perceive the bookmark that hid the "Big Card"! It’s so handsome! The term invented by Russell the Great is not elegant enough, not reserved enough, and does not conform to the identity of the nobility, but it is the only feeling I have now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Tarot will have a complete "God Way"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should it be complete? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not know which one? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what, it symbolizes the road to God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the glory of Mr. Fool, we will one day become the most powerful and secretive force! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if there are any other cards in the bookmarks...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Li control the excitement, and longed for the pride of the dining maid to help herself lay the napkin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned around and looked to Earl Hall, who was used to reading newspapers while having breakfast:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Dad, is there any news worth watching today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hall Earl sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The demon killed another innocent person, the 12th, it is a fashion designer who has just been famous for a long time, she has encountered a few street girls just because poverty is difficult to support, she encountered Such a terrible thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately, there were witnesses this time. Someone witnessed the scene where the devil committed a bloody case. Oh, he was frightened and kept yelling on the street, 'killing people', 'Helping life', huh, I have to say that his call for his help has a very good effect, the devil did not catch up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The police used this to lock the suspect, Intensively searched."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey once again draws a red moon on the chest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "May their actions be successful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, listening to your description, it was a terrible and funny scene."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that the eyewitness will not have a nightmare afterwards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the same night, "fool" The gentleman’s leader did not disturb anyone’s removal of the “Big Card” in the heavily protected museum... Audrey added to her heart and filled herself with some fine . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kingdom Museum, in the restored study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure that only two bookmarks were stolen?" Max Levimore, captain of the "Heart of Hearts" team, asked the players. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, he sneaked at his eyes and stood at his desk, facing away from his big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an old man wearing a white priest’s robe and wearing a cap of a clergyman, who is the head of the Beckland Parish of the Church of Steam and Machinery. Member of the pre-God meeting, Archbishop Horamick Haydn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big man is not only a clergyman, but also a very famous scientist, an honorary professor of physics at Beckland University. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, only those two bookmarks were stolen." The questioned team replied quite steadily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Max gently decapitated and looked at Horamick Haydn. After thinking about it, he asked: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archbishop, after the closing of the evening yesterday, some aristocratic children came to visit. They have touched some of the exhibits, including one of the two stolen bookmarks. Do you need to cooperate with the investigation?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know this thing." Holamik turned his hands naturally and lowered his body, saying calmly, "I have already confirmed, those nobles The children have nothing to do with the thieves who steal the bookmarks, and they don’t need to let them cooperate with the investigation.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, Lord Archbishop.” Max didn’t feel anything. The problem, not to mention the Archbishop Haydn has enough occult knowledge and all kinds of extraordinary skills to confirm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holamic has a very gentle and kind face, and at the same time he did not show the slightest anger, he looked around in a circle:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And more than one person who was here last night, at least two, divided into two opposing parties."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The sequence of one of them may even be higher than me, and the other party has escaped strangely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although I can't restore the complete scene, But some things are still 'look'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things are more complicated than we think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Having said that, he sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also know why they are stealing bookmarks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have been deceived by Russell for more than 150 years..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3000 pounds, it’s really painful, I’ve been stunned for so long It’s less than 1,000 pounds... However, the “Big Card” is an invaluable treasure, and you can’t get the money. The “Justice” contribution in this matter is definitely worth the price...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, they are deducted from the one she owes me, slightly relieved some pressure. If I meet Mr. Azick in the future, I will pay the 15,000 pounds with a high-sequence formula. The rewards of "the singer"... The other "brands of 亵渎" don't know what it is disguised. According to the character of the great emperor, it should be quite unexpected... Klein ended the response and looked at the fog outside the palace. The ocean, silently sighed a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
