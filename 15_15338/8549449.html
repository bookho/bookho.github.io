			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a golden glow outside the window, and Klein looked at Melissa’s eyes, but she couldn’t find a word because the prepared lines were not used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coughed twice and brainstormed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melissa, this is not I wasted my salary. After Benson and my colleagues came to visit, did you entertain them in such a place? After I got married with Benson, I have a wife. Is it a bed?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you have a fiancee yet? You can wait a little longer and get more money." Melissa said clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Melissa, this is the rule of society." Klein was a headache and could only go to the point, "Since I took the week of 3 pounds." Salary, there must be a decent match with a weekly salary of 3 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, he has been crowded into a shared house, and he is no stranger to the current living conditions. Completely adapted, but it is because of this experience that he has become more and more aware of the inconvenience of similar environments to girls, and his goal is to become extraordinary, to study occultism, to find the "road" to go home, and in the future will be at home. Some magical rituals, apartment people are mixed, easy to go wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Melissa wants to say that Klein has added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, I I didn’t think about the single-family house, I’m going to look at the townhouse. In short, I have to have my own bathroom. Also, I also like Mrs. Sling’s bread, Tining cake and lemon cake. We can first consider leaving the Iron Cross Street and Near the daffodil street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa's lips were slightly stunned, silently, and slowly lowered her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, I am not in a hurry to move, I have to wait for Benson to come back." Klein smiled. "Otherwise, after he opens the door, it will be very Shocked and surprised, what is my family? My brother and sister? My home? Is this my home? Am I going to the wrong place? Goddess, tell me if this is a dream, How come out a few days back, even the family is gone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mimicked Benson’s tone and heard Melissa bend his eyes unconsciously Shallow dimples on the cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Mr. Ferranci will wait at the door, let Benson hand over the keys to the apartment, and Banson will not be able to get up." The girl lost her money. The landlord's sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Moretti’s home, everyone loves to take the lead of Mr. Frankie as a joke. This atmosphere is brought by the big brother Banson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, he won’t change the lock for the next tenant." Klein smiled and pointed to the door, and said with interest, "Ms. Melissa , go to the Silver Crown Restaurant to celebrate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa sighed slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Klein, do you know Selena? My classmates, my good friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina? Klein’s mind suddenly showed a girl with long red hair and dark brown eyes. Her parents were all believers of the goddess of the night, and she was blessed by the name of Saint Selena. She was not yet sixteen. She is half a year younger than her sister Melissa. She is a happy, cheerful and outgoing girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Klein’s dagger said that he remembered Selena Wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her brother Chris is a lawyer, and currently has a weekly salary of nearly £3, and his fiancée is a part-time typist." Melissa first described The situation, then said, "They have been engaged for more than four years, in order to have a stable and good life after marriage, until today they are still saving money, have not yet stepped into the church, intend to wait at least another year, according to Selina. People like her brother are like this. They usually get married after 28 years old. You have to prepare in advance, save money and don't waste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going to the restaurant for dinner, is it necessary to have so many reasons... Klein didn’t know whether to cry or laugh, and thought for a few seconds: “Melissa, I have a weekly salary of 3 pounds, and every year thereafter. It will increase, you don't have to worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we need to save money to prevent accidents, such as the security company suddenly closed down, I have a classmate, that is Because the company where my father is in bankruptcy can only go to the dock to find some temporary work, the conditions of the family are instantaneous. After getting worse, I had to drop out of school." Melissa smiled and persuaded her brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein reached out and rubbed his face: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The family, the security company and the government, um, have something to do with the government and will not go bankrupt." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The government is also unstable. After each election, if there is a change in the party, most of the positions will be replaced and become a mess." Melissa retorted relentlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... sister, you know how much... Klein shook his head in a good and funny way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Okay..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I will stew the soup with the ingredients left yesterday, you go to the street to buy a fried fish, a piece of paint Beef in black pepper sauce, a small jar of cream, and a cup of ginger beer, in short, a little celebration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an iron cross street hawker The food we often peddled, a sautéed fish 6 to 8 pence, a penny of black pepper juice not too big, a penny of 1 cup of ginger beer, a small jar of cream about a quarter of a pound, 4 pence - Buy 1 pound of cream directly and only need 1 Sule 3 pence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original owner will be responsible for the purchase of home ingredients every holiday, no stranger to the price, Klein mentally counted for a few seconds, it is roughly necessary 1 Soller 6 Penny, so directly extracted the two 1 Sule banknotes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." In this regard, Melissa no longer objected, put down the stationery bag and took the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at his sister’s small jar of cream and a bowl of other food, he walked briskly to the door, and Klein thought about it and shouted. She: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melissa, the rest of the money to buy some fruit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iron Cross Many hawkers on the street will buy fruit from poor quality or long-term storage from other places, and people here are not angry because the price is very cheap. Just go home and cut off the rotten place to taste delicious. It is a cheap enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After saying this, Klein quickly stepped over and took out the remaining copper pennies from his trouser pocket and put it in the palm of his sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Melissa's brown eyes were puzzled and looked at her brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stepped back two steps and smiled a little:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember to go to Mrs. Sling, reward I have a small piece of lemon cake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Melissa opened her mouth, her eyes groaned, and finally spit out a word, "Good. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned quickly and pulled out the door, and ran to the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A river passes through, cypress and maple trees stand on both sides, fresh air It makes people feel drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s revolver to solve the interview, with a cane, walked down the public carriage that paid 6 pence, along the cement road, towards the green The three-story masonry house in the shade is close, which is the office building of the University of Tining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s one of the two most famous universities in the Kingdom of Lun..." Klein, who came here for the first time, sighed as he walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to here, Hoy University across the river is simply rudimentary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello!" "Hello!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One shouts asymptotically, two The rowing boat rushed from the upper reaches of the Hoy River, and a wooden paddle was tidy and orderly turned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a popular rowing sport in all the universities in the Kingdom of Lun. With Klein funding, it is necessary to rely on scholarships to complete the university’s family, both with Welch and others. People have participated in the rowing club of Hoy University and have a good boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s so young..." Klein stopped and looked and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another week, this situation will cease to exist because the school is going to have a summer vacation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the tree-lined road, he walked to the gray three-story masonry house, and through registration, he smoothly entered the inside and was familiar with the office he received last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! He slammed the half-covered door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in." A male voice came out inside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein stepped in, the middle-aged teacher in a white shirt and black tuxedo frowned slightly:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still an hour in the interview."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Stone, do you remember me? Student of Cohen's senior associate professor, gram Ryan Moretti, you have read my recommendation letter." Kline smiled and took off his hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Havan.Stone touched his black beard and wondered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Do you have anything? I am not responsible for the interview."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is like this, I have found a job and will not be interviewed today." Klein Truthfully said the intention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way..." Havin Stone understood over, stood up and extended his right hand. "Congratulations, it’s a polite young man. I will tell Mr. Professor and the senior associate professors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shook hands with the other party, and he decided to leave with a few words, but suddenly came behind him. A familiar voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moreti, have you found another job?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein turned and saw an old man with silver hair, deep outline, but not many wrinkles. His eyes were sunken, his throat was dark blue, and his black tuxedo was pretty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, mentor, Mr. Azick." He was busy saying, "How are you here?"<br /><br />&nbsp; The old man is a senior associate professor at the Department of History at Hoyle University. His mentor, Mr. Quentin Cohen, is next to Cohen and has a medium-sized, middle-aged man with a bronzed skin. Take a newspaper, no need to leave, wear a hat, black hair brown, soft facial features, eyes reveal an indescribable vicissitudes, under the right ear with a fine look to find the black cockroach. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein recognizes him and often helps the former Lord’s history department faculty member Azke, who likes to argue with his mentor, Cohen’s senior associate professor. Conflict, however, in fact, the two have a good personal relationship, otherwise they will not like to have a chat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cohn nodded and said softly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I and Azko came to participate What kind of work did you find in an academic conference?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A security company that looks for, collects and protects antiquities, they need professional consultants, 3 per week Pound.” Klein repeated the words he had said to his sister yesterday, and then explained, “You know, I like to explore history, not to sum up history.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Cohen gently sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone has their own choices, you can remember to inform them at the University of Tingen, not directly absent, I Very satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Azick interrogated: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein Do you know what happened to Welch and Naya? I read the newspaper saying that they were killed by the robbers in the room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case turned into a robbery? And so soon on the newspaper? Klein stunned and thought about the language: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The specific situation, I am not too clear, before Welch got a Quaternary Solomon The notes of the Imperial Antigonus family, I was asked to interpret it. I started to go for a few days, and then I was busy looking for a job. The police came to me two days ago."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately revealed the "Solomon Empire" and "Antigonus family", want to see if the two history teachers will know something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Quaternary..." Cohen frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
