			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red moon outside the window is covered by clouds. The moonlight that penetrates the curtain can only barely outline the outline of the large items in the bedroom. The faint and dim is the main theme of the room. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is sitting in such an environment and is not in a hurry to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Dr. Allen, who was asleep in bed, and quietly analyzed a picture he had seen in his dream:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will. Onsetin finally held the 'Fate of Fortune' card in his hand, and in this dream, everything is symbolic and acquired by his own star spirit. Revelation... That is to say, Will Anthony’s thing is related to 'destiny', plus the silver-white snake that probably represents the 'Silver Snake', which kid may be with the 'monster' route. High sequence strong or which is very different...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His crisis comes from the 'Silver of the Mercury' to him, or the one he is involved in What is the seal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the 'Silver of Mercury' is the sequence 1 and belongs to the kind of existence that is closest to the gods. Only the name itself reflects his high personality. Maybe it’s not a child like Will. Anthony, who still doesn’t know whether it’s Sequence 1, or Sequence 2, Sequence 3, Amon, who relied on only one avatar, almost invaded the fog...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing doesn't seem so simple, it certainly hides a great secret. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein has decided to withdraw.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is very dangerous, And the tarot card is not necessarily a magical item. The special one is probably Will. Anthony itself. Well, Dr. Allen has got rid of the troubles except for a nightmare. I have no reason to blend this thing. Actively performing on this, the challenge is impossible, it is almost equivalent to suicide... Well, yes, I have to follow the wishes of the heart! Klein propped up the surface of the dresser with his right palm in black gloves and slowly stood up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the dream, he was completely sure, Dr. Allen's nightmare comes from the revelation that the spiritual body of the star has acquired from the spiritual world, and that revelation is the deliberate creation and provision of a high-level high-status, and the paper crane is a positioning prop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a chapter in the Book of Secrets, Klein can also try to use the paper crane to find the star spirit of Dr. Allen in the spirit of the spirit, and observe those secretly Where does the revelation come from, but he has just decided not to blend.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The activity took the body, and Klein took out the last curiosity and pulled out Dr. Allen. The leather wallet, took out the thousand paper cranes from inside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He placed the paper cranes on the cane head while holding them, then The eyelids turned deep and whispered to himself: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Will. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the divination statement was repeated seven times, there was a slight breeze swirling in the room, with a cool soul blowing.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein loosened his right palm, and the cane first stood firmly, then fell down with a thousand paper cranes, pointing obliquely to the bed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Where..." Klein frowned slightly, changed position, repeated the divination, and got feedback.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and two divinations The point of the intersection is Dr. Allen!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will. The location of Willettin overlaps with Dr. Allen... This is a bit interesting... Klein He laughed and stunned two sentences.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His curiosity climbed to the extreme.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Although he does not intend to blend this matter, he wants to figure out why there is an overlap.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm...take the paper crane to the gray Divination above the fog, there is fog, Nothing unexpected... Klein quickly got a new idea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And because it’s not convenient to hold his own ritual in Dr. Allen’s bedroom, He decided to take the thousand paper cranes home first.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was actually prepared for this - before Klein did not confirm the seriousness of the matter, It is possible to look for Will Anthony, to see if he can get the idea of ​​the tarot card, so he prepared another thousand paper cranes in advance, intending to replace the authenticity, to facilitate his various divination. , and then solve the problem and change it back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he thought of it, Klein pulled out the prepared paper crane from his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his deliberately folded over the fog, preventing Dr. Allen from suddenly deciding to hand over Will-Ansett’s items to the Goddess Church. So that he made the divestment out of divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-consideration and detail can make things a lot simpler... Klein self-appreciated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a thin moonlight, he carefully compares Will's paper cranes and his own paper cranes to see if there are obvious differences. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time, Klein suddenly fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His manual ability is not as good as a child...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, all are paper cranes There is not much difference. I am only a little rough at the top. Allen has not repeatedly studied the original one, and certainly can’t see that it has been dropped. Take out a coin and make a final confirmation with divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After affirmative revelation, he put the folded paper crane into Allen’s wallet and put it back in its original position. After handling the scene, the paper crane carrying Will Anthony left No. 3, Benningham Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "Buddle Method", Klein returned to his home smoothly, taking a bath and idling, using his own method of summoning himself, the thousand papers The crane and the "master key" were sent to the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in a quiet, uninhabited palace, he picked up a thousand paper cranes and examined it for a few seconds without any abnormalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Klein has a pen and paper, and wrote the same divination statement as before:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Will. Onsetin's current position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he switched to the "dream divination" in the gray world Surprisingly seeing a picture: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a dark room, a tiger’s head, a dark-eyed Will. On the desk in front of the window, looking out at the scenery outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed a stack of tarot cards in both hands, and there was a pile of wood next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building blocks spelled out a ring-shaped snake that was connected end to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene outside the window is equally dark, only the faint sound of flowing water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream is here and it’s silent, Klein opens his eyes and taps the edge of the bronze long table with his fingers, silently saying:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The snake at the end of the race, is it a 'silver of mercury'? A 'silver snake' that represents fate...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a sound of running water outside the window, indicating that Will Ansett is currently in close proximity to the Tsock River? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before I was divined to his position and overlapped with Dr. Allen, was it interfered with fate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the divination above the fog can only get this level of revelation, Klein is no longer troubled by curiosity, barely made an interpretation, and intends to exchange the thousand cranes for tomorrow night, looking for opportunities Pointing again, pointing to Dr. Allen, let him go to the church of the goddess of the night to tell the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing still has to be done by the regular army... Klein laughed and returned to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a leisurely bath, he was not busy, and he got into the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long time, I don’t know how long, Klein suddenly felt shocked and consciously knew that she was dreaming, and was doing a look at the Secret Book in the living room. dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, this familiar feeling... He habitually made a sudden performance, looking to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slammed open and a figure in a gray coat came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is about thirty years old, his cheeks are slender, his forehead is wide, and he has a pair of dark blue eyes that look quite wise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
