			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don’t have to tell me, I’ve been pretty sure... I heard Anderson Hood’s words, and Klein calmly groaned in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the very beginning, when I met Renee 缇 Nicole in the spiritual world, and saw her huge real body and Gothic castle, Klein thought The other party is not simple, but the messenger just killed the performance of the strongest hunter, and let him undoubtedly believe that the other is a demigod, at least the sequence 4! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half god is sending me a letter for each gold coin? I think with my toes, I know that things will not be simple. Miss Courier must have other plots. Of course, I don’t rule out that I always encounter strange things, make her feel interesting, just like she is very free, so she is a guest. Courier...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar situation also includes the "magic mirror" of Arrods's pleasing, "the Mercury Snake" Will Anthony's goodwill... ... no matter what, you still have to beware, you can't be too convinced... If you have the opportunity to discuss the corresponding things, don't consider the danger, whether you want to blow the harmonica, maybe the messenger will tear me out directly. ... Klein thought a lot, and his expression was still indifferent. In the face of the horrified Anderson, the position was very small:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have nothing to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......This guy is really mysterious! There is actually a semi-god-level spirit creature to be his messenger! Moreover, he casually knows a member of the life school... It is no wonder that after the "immortal king" is so calm and calm... No wonder "the king of immortality" did not seek revenge, or even appeared! Anderson suddenly stunned, could not help but carefully looked at Greman Spallo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?" Klein glanced at the strongest hunter without emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson is busy regaining his gaze and laughing at both channels:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found that you are a good person The protagonist of the painting, the gloomy background of the background, is very temperamental to your temperament.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, do you want to think about it? I can help you paint a portrait, believe me, I have a master level in this respect! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't listen to his crap at all, took out the gold-shelled pocket watch, and glanced at it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back to your room, I will come to you five minutes later. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Anderson responded with a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the strongest hunter left, Klein took out the Azick copper whistle and Will. , turned into the bathroom and arranged the ceremony.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the "Iceberg Lieutenant" Edwina's pearl earrings were brought over the fog, Klein sat To the top of the bronze long table, with a paper pen, write a simple divination statement: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fall of Edwina Edwards. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding the paper and earrings, Klein leaned back on the back of the chair, meditating on the divination statement, and entering the dream with meditation.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first gray world occupied his "vision", and then a snow-covered plain caught his eye.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blizzard of the call sign shrouded everything, and the fog was deep and deep, unlike the real border.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quickly saw the character of Edwina, her brown long It’s a simple knot in the mind, and then dances wildly in the snow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wears a white waistband with a complex pattern on the neckline cuffs and a darker Trousers, in such an environment, intuitively give a thin feeling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edvina’s feet in leather boots are constantly moving on the snow, leaving A row of obvious footprints, but in the raging blizzard, it was buried very easily.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture is gradually broken, Clay He opened his eyes, found himself unable to interpret the specific position "will iceberg" of divine revelation from just inside <br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp;; & nbsp; "Polar & nbsp? Fossack's Yongye Plain? There is no way to be sure. Except for the snow, there is no other symbol..." Klein sat up straight and put down the pearl earrings and the paper with the divination statement.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;He considered it for a few seconds and determined that the other thing is that Edwina Edwards is indeed missing, not on the "Golden Dream", which can preliminarily rule out the possibility of a trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein cautiously made a divination on the matter and got the conclusion that there is no trap on the "Golden Dream". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a while, he left the mysterious space above the fog, and after some busy, brought the pearl earrings back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the current map of the sea near Olawi and the current location of the "Golden Dream", Klein picked a seafaring fisherman to escape the storm On the island, in the letter, Daniz and others drove the ship to a distance not too far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folding the letter paper, he blows the harmonica and once again sees the messenger with four heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While returning the letter, Klein coughed two channels:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you sure of the position of Daniz?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the heads of Renee Nikol’s head nodded, and the rest continued:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can..." "As long as..." "Not over the range..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sees the messenger Still floating there, there is no sign of leaving, looking to the side of the road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gold coin is paid by Daniz."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good..." Renee 缇 Nicole's figure is fading away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coke, Klein breathed a sigh of relief, carefully prepared, handled the scene, carrying the packed luggage, walked out of the door and rang Anderson. Hood's door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to another place before going to Baiam." He calmly told the strongest hunter's own decision, "You can choose to go to Baiam." Wait for me, or follow me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson laughed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel like me The blood of the adventurer is burning, I am curious what the messenger will bring.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought I didn't have a chance to know, who knows you? I even invited me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't, I just gave you two options... Klein turned indifferently and walked up the stairs, Anderson hurriedly mentioned his newly bought suitcase, fast Steps follow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the hotel, Klein leaves the port city by horse-drawn carriage and walks to the edge of an uninhabited cliff on Mount San Drico. Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the layers of waves that are constantly striking the wall below, Anderson feels a little stunned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This is our destination? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein ignored his question, took out a spell made of white tin, and thought of the "storm" mantra.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He infuse spirituality, divides these spells into two, half gives himself, half applies to Anderson, leaving only one of them to the bottom of the cliff.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Underwater breathing, deep seawater film..." Anderson is surprised to distinguish the extranatural effects of his body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is here At the time, there was a loud noise under the cliff, and a huge monster resembling a whale appeared in the sea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was dark blue in its body, and its mouth was open and exposed. White Sensen's teeth and bloody interior.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walked to the edge of the cliff and jumped straight down, with the help of the power of the spell, fluttering into the huge The mouth of the sea creatures.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson first looked at him with a blank look, then followed with a lot of excitement Jumped down and fell to Klein.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge underwater creature closed its mouth and made it dark.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, it sinks into the water and swims toward the intended target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its mouth, Klein stunned the lightning, and saw the darkness, looking for a tooth to rest, sitting down leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the protection of the "deep sea film", he is not worried that the clothes will be soiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, a little bit..." Anderson looked around and curiously asked, "How did you come to mind? What did you do?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, pray to yourself, then use the "Poseidon Scepter" to pull the head and come to the appropriate underwater creatures nearby... Klein did not answer Anderson’s question, half closed With your eyes on it, it seems to be raising your spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a bit stuffy..." Anderson took out the cigarette case and the match from his pocket. "Can you smoke?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You ask it." Klein didn't blink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson laughed twice and put the cigarettes and matches back:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think It doesn't like the taste of cigarettes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark, dark sea, this huge creature is swimming fast, using special organs from time to time, very efficient Extract oxygen from the surrounding water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, it surfaced, and there was a desert island in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After using the power of the spell to land on the desert island, Klein took the hat off the sea creature and took off his hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very polite..." Anderson witnessed the scene and said with a funny voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have always been very polite, even in the face of prey." Klein glanced at each other as if to say, like you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson laughed and pointed to the other side of the desert island:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a ship there .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, 'Golden Dream Number'! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Klein also saw the clean and tidy sailboat, which is tens of meters long, the symbol of the main gun that should not appear, The light circulates.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately carried the baggage and leaned over. It didn’t take long for him to come to the place where the “Golden Dream” was parked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he saw Daniz jumping off the deck and wading through.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz just came In front of German Sparrow, he was thinking about how to speak, and suddenly saw a familiar figure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anderson Hood! He pointed to the strongest hunter and shouted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson suddenly laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I can't think of it?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is not sure why he will encounter the "Golden Dream", but this does not prevent him from taking the initiative.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know? Klein glanced at Daniz with indifference.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz instinct shuddered, heap Smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy is not a good person. In the foggy sea, he is always chased by a group of pirates. Then, those pirates become inexplicably turned into Bounty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may not know that he was born in the 'God of Knowledge and Wisdom' church, and later he was driven out because of repeated examinations. These are all I listen to. The captain said that they used to be classmates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down on Anderson’s IQ, and the “flower bow tie” on board, Yodsen and others also made A similar performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson’s gaze swept slowly from their faces and snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
