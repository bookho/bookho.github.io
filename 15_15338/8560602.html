			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the story of "upside down man", Klein inevitably recalls the "red angel" Medici, who recalls the inside of the underground relics. Evil spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he did not share the discovery of this exploration, one is temporarily unnecessary, and the other is related to Miss Sharon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the other members, the last time they knew about the destruction of Banxi Port, the "downside down" did not disclose new information, and naturally there was no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that everyone has not spoken, Alger swept the "world" and took his eyes back, calmly saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "It's yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hidden" Jia De Li Ya immediately sideways, looking to the "Magic" Firth:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms., what do you know about Mr. Gate? I can pay the corresponding reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Forth, who did not want to reveal his own problems, heard the latter half of the sentence, suddenly hesitated, and wavered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remuneration, I don’t know how much the lady of the “hidden” can give me... I don’t know enough about Mr. “Men”... and part of it is the source In the words of Mr. "Footer"... "Magic" Firth once again looks at the top of the bronze long table: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, Can I speak?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because every time I meet the other full moon, Klein knows that the "Magician" is not in a good economic situation, nodded with a smile道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls breathed a sigh of relief and turned to " The Hidden Guardian" 嘉德丽雅道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"500 pounds, you can apply for separate communication."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Delia did not counter-offer and thought: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you can talk directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;She hopes that other members will hear the story of Miss "Magic" Mr. remembered more "door" related. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folse nodded and thought about the language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have received one A magical item that helps people navigate the spirit world. After use, every time a full moon or bloody month, you will hear strange proverbs, which will bring almost out of control pain.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And according to Mr. 'fool', this proverb comes from Mr. 'Men'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused for a second and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He may be asking for help. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Fols is suffering this kind of pain in silence... She doesn’t show it at all, she always enjoys life very much... “Justice” Audrey consciously sympathizes with friends and examines the inability to use the “audience” to discover the inadequacy of Firth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The magical items... the proverbs at the full moon... Suspected to be in distress... "The Hidden" Jia Delia retells the focus of the "Magician" in her heart, and is satisfied with the first words:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your description. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her gaze swept through other members, and unfortunately found no one had an extra reaction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Free communication continues, nothing has come to an end.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the members have left and helped them complete the substantive operations of several transactions, Klein Return to the real world, sit relaxed on the easy chair and rest for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After folding the letter paper and writing information on No. 126, Gald Street, Hurley, and Murray Asia Pacific, Klein once again opened the iron cigarette case, so that "the blood will be" Senegal emerged silently. next to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "resent" is like a close-fitting servant, humbly picking up the letter on the table and disappearing into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a postbox a few blocks away, a letter came out of nowhere and fell into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; East Chester County, within the castle of the Hall family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey Bishop looked at the mirror without a focal length, and the contents of the book "The Book of Secrets" echoed in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These knowledge interlaced to form an illusory book, which, once recalled, can be presented and translated to the appropriate number of pages based on the idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the product of Klein’s ability to directly mobilize the power of the mysterious space above the fog, and combine the information given with the divination dreaming ability. Can last for one to two weeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is enough for Audrey to read the Book of Secrets, and if there is something unclear, he can continue to ask for a gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The state of Mr. ‘fool’ seems to be getting better and better...” Audrey thought with joy, and her eyes gradually returned to glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up and walked to the door, laughing at the golden-haired big dog sitting outside boring:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Su Shi, you can't be a lady like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi looked around with a sigh of relief, took a nose, and then said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the most standard action for a hound training."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not qualified Hound... Audrey groaned and said with a smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you would answer me like this: Audrey, I am just a dog~" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi seriously responded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Overly repeated words are easily grasped by others Habits and psychological activities.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Audrey, that is what the book of psychology says. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Audrey couldn't find a language response for a while, just then, she saw her father, Count Earl, with a personal servant. A waiter walked up the stairs of the castle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even if the outside is sunny, it is still faint, even the candlesticks are lit, they are inlaid On the wall, the stairs are illuminated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This castle is so old, I think it must have a major renovation. Earl Hall complained casually to his daughter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey held a nod to:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, dear Earl, this is why I don't like it, it makes me feel like I am slowly decaying. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I actually spend £13,000 a year repairing it here. Earl Hall sighed with a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey glanced at Su Shi and smiled at his father:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, what are you looking for? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Hall pointed to the paper path of the attendant:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Beckland's telegram, someone is selling a 10% stake in the bicycle company, baby, is there any interest? I think this industry has a very bright future, and it is far from meeting the minimum expectations. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl Hall smiled and looked at her daughter: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A two-wheeled machine for people to ride, you can understand this, the average man's carriage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Luen, in Beckland, the largest number is not a nobleman, not a businessman, but an ordinary person engaged in manual labor, and secondly among them. There are more types of technology, this is the people who are aiming at the bicycle. They have an absolute majority and a certain purchasing power. Even if only 10% are willing to buy a bicycle, this company can get a very good development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, they have the right patents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey believes in his father’s vision I also understand the prospects described by Earl Hall, and nodded lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 10% share is worth about."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" According to preliminary investigations, the Beckland bicycle company is currently only worth 50,000 pounds. This is because the promotion of goods and the outbreak of sales still take time to brew, so you can't simply think of 10%. The stock is only worth 5,000 pounds. My suggestion is that the first round of the offer is 8,000 pounds, and the psychological reserve price is 15,000 pounds. I will send someone to help you with this matter." Earl Hollock said succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around 10,000 pounds... I used almost the same amount of cash this month... Audrey said a little embarrassed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, I can't get the money, and it takes a certain amount of time to sell stocks, real estate, minerals, or wait for their earnings."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hall Earl laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to be so troublesome, you will be Beckland Arms Group or Pritz Commercial Ship After the company's shares are pledged to the bank for a short period of time, they can get enough cash, and when the matter is over, they will pledge the shares of the bicycle company to the bank for a long time and return the loan with the loan.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"In this way, you only need to pay a high interest of one to two weeks to complete the transaction, and the bicycle company's annual dividend is enough to pay interest on long-term loans, so that you can wait patiently for appreciation, and this is Great probability of things. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey has not received a complete commercial finance education, but a father who is a big banker is not unfamiliar with similar things. After thinking about it, I understood the whole process and confirmed the question: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, I only need to pay two or three hundred pounds to get the bicycle company 10 % of shares? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe a little less." Earl Hall said with a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey understands what his father meant, as the largest shareholder of Bhaut Bank, the fourth largest shareholder of Beckland Bank, He has enough power to get his daughter to get short-term loans with reasonable interest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, dear Earl. "Audrey smiled and lifted the skirt and gave a gift.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Under the moonlight of the night, the sea is dark blue and dark, and Alger Wilson stands at the bow and looks at the quiet silhouette of Passo Island.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is The headquarters of the Storm Church, the land of true God!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the middle of the church, Alger remembers that he has only been there three times, once to find the "Blue Avenger" After being promoted to "Navigator", once was the last year's debriefing, and once again, a long time ago, as a mixed-race child with dark blue hair, was selected into the headquarters and became a group of children's choirs, but no singing. He was quickly sent out and returned to the chapel of the island where he was born, and the priest there was a very rude to his subordinates.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever he recalls this experience, his expression will become quite condensed, eager to climb high.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind In the midst of the sound, the "Blue Avenger" quietly headed for the port.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
