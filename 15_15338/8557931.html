			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On April 9th, I just came back from the masquerade ball of the Countess of Walling, and suddenly I was a little empty.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A woman, a woman, another woman, monotonous and mechanical movements, the indescribable perfume smell, the warmth of the body entanglement, can only be exchanged for a few seconds of pleasure, then there is no end to boredom , disgust, emptiness and numbness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What fun is this life? The meaning of living every day is for this?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I can't go on like this anymore, I have to get rid of this degenerate state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also, self-reminding, don't get used to writing Arabic numerals in everyday positions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;...Great Emperor, do you also have time for reflection and Wenqing? This does not match your image in my mind! Klein looked a little frowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and fell to the second diary:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"April 11 On the day, Countess Wallingen invited me to attend an intimate salon. She told me that Mrs. Julia would also attend.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, this from Lun The conservative blondes who are married will also participate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really look forward to it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have imagined that she has been in bed for a long time, wish Her husband, Mr. Deli, did not care. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Emperor, have you forgotten the diary you wrote the day before? Hey, really fragrant, right? And, you are typo, mind! Kline can't help but vomit. Two sentences.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On April 14th, the recent participation in the event was too frequent, and some of the powers were not enough...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a trivial matter!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I am still young, I have to prevent the risk of recession in this area, moderation, moderation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'The archaeologist' has improved my physique and effectively enhanced certain abilities, but this is not its area of ​​expertise, it is incidental.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue to improve the sequence, the changes brought about by the potion should also be deepened, this is a direction of hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that 'pharmacists' can modulate drugs with no side effects, maybe I have to find a few to consult.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, really want to control, indulgence will only lead to a continuous increase in the threshold, the degree of satisfaction is not as normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sit down and think about it, there are still many things you can do. Human beings are always like this. They are bound by desire and can't see what is really valuable. Why am I? Will pass through, the secret of the starry sky at the top of the head is hidden, where the original consciousness comes from, self-cognition if it comes from consciousness alone, then who is the identity of Huang Tao before, who is the most essential part? ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater, are you explaining to me what is pre-existing as a wolf, afterwards a philosopher? Hey, you have some concerns in that regard, I thought you solidified some properties... Fortunately, you didn’t teach Chinese to your children, um, you shouldn’t teach, otherwise they will think after seeing these things. ? Charato predicts that your eldest daughter Bernard will turn against you and turn away from you, not without reason... Of course, not teaching them more is a kind of protection... Klein was amused by Russell’s diary, but There is no change in the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diary of Russell the Great is a knowledge book and a joke set for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Klein turned to the next diary:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"October 2, Charato came to visit me again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He hopes that I have entered the semi-god and half-human field, I can fulfill my promise and help him steal the dangerous from the church. Seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Klein's pupils are difficult to contain and shrink: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be the note that was lost later in the secret service. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be the one that led to the death of Klein Moretti and let him use the other's body to successfully wake up in this world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the source of everything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out that it did not fall into the hands of the Secret Society, but was later sealed at the Artisan Church of the time. Internally, Zaratu succeeded in stealing it through Russell the Great...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, the member of the savage hunger" is very Fearing Charato, thinking that he is an undead abnormal monster, does this mean that Charato has gained some benefits with the help of notes, but there has been an accident, from the 'people' who can communicate with Russell The monster, so, will there be the loss of the Antignus family notes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, it is not ruled out that Charato intentionally let it be lost...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ...Because Charato becomes a monster, the secret will lose all the mermaids, and the subsequent 'faceless people' have to venture out to sea? Rosagio succeeded because he tried to enter the ocean that was derived from the ruins of the gods. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thought flashed in Klein's mind, making his heart extremely dignified.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He does not think that the Antignus notes he encountered are closely related to Russell, because he has always speculated that the direction is the law of extraordinary characteristic aggregation, and some subsequent details also conform to similar logic. Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the high level of the "Divination" approach? Klein's afterglow sweeps, quietly extending, and the endless fog is in the eye.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will it be caused by it? He asks himself again in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stable emotions, Klein continues to browse Subsequent content of the diary: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I have to decide depending on the situation. If it is easy to steal and there is no risk of exposure, I will try to do it, and vice versa. No such thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if Charato reveals me, it doesn't matter, with my current identity, status, sequence, influence, as long as I am willing to turn back, I am willing to repent, the church is not What will happen to me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two diaries on this page record the mentality of Russell’s idea of ​​stealing, but it doesn’t seem to be successful. Probably, however, Klein knew that he eventually got the note and handed it to the leader of the Secret Society, Charato. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly addicted, Klein turned over the diary of this page:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twelve Days On the day, I once again attended the ancient secret meeting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the party, I found that they were extremely hostile to the Quaternary Solomon Empire and they were very consistent. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I raised this question, Mr. Hermes gave me the answer, and in the Quaternary, the allies and supporters of the Solomon Empire were 'real. Creator'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I resisted asking about the impulse of what our organization did in the Quaternary history, but left the palace and returned in dreams. I found that Mr. Hermes’s route has a certain degree of coincidence with me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This ancient man who survived the Cataclysm must know a lot. I set a close, and sincerely asked him a question, that is why the organization hates the 'real creator'? Just because He used the sacred name of the Creator? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old Mr. Hermes smiled and said, we are not such superficial creatures.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" He asked me a question, do you know the specific ability of the 'Shepherd'? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
