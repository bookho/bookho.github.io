In this regard, he can only make the most rough judgments and can’t immediately respond to the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeping out the window to dispel the dark gas streetlights, Klein regained his gaze, picked up the white glazed porcelain and set the gold teacup, and took a sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Richardson sees the words and brave the courage:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. I already want to understand, you are right. Everyone has grown up with no experience and little experience. Thank you for giving me such a chance to grow up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming the death of Godopus and his gang, he finally stopped worrying and began to consider his career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous replacement of employers in a short period of time is a considerable stain for a servant. Once resigned from Dawn Dontes, Richardson I believe that it is very difficult for me to continue to be a close-knit man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a great damage for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not only because the personal servant’s annual salary is at least 25 pounds, far better than other non-management positions, and the hostess’s personal maid is also close to The servant and the personal maid are the ones who have the best chance of becoming a steward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They follow the male owner or the hostess to help them deal with trivia, to be their megaphone, and when their assistants can effectively develop their abilities and master the housekeeper comprehensively The various skills, and thus become the employer's cronies, as long as the opportunity, can be relatively easily turned into a manor deacon, butler assistant, deputy butler, step by step to become a housekeeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richardson is really eager to live a quiet life, but this does not mean that he is willing to be a servant all the time. He undoubtedly wants to rely on his own efforts to get More salary, get a higher status, and the steward of a rich family is his ultimate goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now understand, it’s not too late." Klein responded with a smile and allowed Richardson to stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to 160 Burke Lund Street, he told the housekeeper Tanai to let the kitchen prepare for himself a 11:30 nightingale, while going up Three floors, take off your jacket and enter the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the hot water in the bathtub has been put in place by the maid five minutes in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not rush to take a bath, came to the fog, and figured out who was praying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. X... Traveler... Miss "Magician" is not inefficient... Unconsciously, she has grown up... Klein A few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After serious consideration, he has the "world" of German Sparrow, let this dummy pray in the diffuse fog:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Give me time, place, and more information, so that I can act."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein's idea is simple, that is, the ability of the "traveler" is quite useful, but it is difficult for Dawn Dontes to leave Berkrund Street for a long time or stay in the room if Miss "Magic" While providing detailed and reliable information, doing an assassination will not affect anything, but if the "world" collects news from the outside, it must be impossible to do, which will affect its more important things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, "Magic" Firth responded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... I will collect it as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Mr. X’s party has not yet determined when and where he will be next time, she can only wait patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rounding this up, Klein returned to the real world, stripping himself and lying in the bathtub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been to the Saint Seychelles church several times during this time to listen to Bishop Electra to explain "The Revelation of the Night" and to master the image and characteristics of the two internal caretakers. However, because there is no duplication, he still has It is impossible to determine the rules of the caretaker's rotation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this kind of behavior will also cause trouble, Klein opened his eyes and looked at the mist above, sighing in his heart:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first review should be coming..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A frequent visit to the interior of the Saint-Saill's Church People with high probability will be subject to censorship by the "nights", and similar things are more inevitable when his origins are not so clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no review, it is a serious dereliction of duty for the night-timers... Klein slowly vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the Saint Seychelles Church, Leonard walks out slowly A quiet to silent room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His green eyes are now stained with black strange water, and there are countless illusory bubbles and cockroaches appearing and disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, so soon became the 'Soul of the Soul', catch up with me." Dai Li Simoni standing in the hallway Like self-deprecating, congratulations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is still wearing a hooded black robe, painted with blue eyeshadow and blush, a kind of demon beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Leonard saw the familiar lady, she only felt that the other person’s temperament was a bit colder, and her body seemed to hide countless shadows. Layer after layer, deep and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Obviously, I am still a long way from you. In your state, you should be promoted to the 'gatekeeper'?" Leonard is Dai Li was not too casual in front of her, and she was more serious in her speech, because if she was joking, the final blush would be him, not the lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——“Janitor” is the sequence of the “necropsy” pathway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will be two months ago." Dai Li said without concealment, her expression was slightly distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard probably understood what it was, and nodded slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet accumulated Enough merit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dalley snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's like getting out of bed, everything is ready, but you find that there is no condom at home, and outside is night, most of the shops in the nearby neighborhood are closed! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wonderful metaphor... Leonard is not okay, only smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You can take over some things proactively. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not give Dai Li the opportunity to speak, he pointed to the other side of the corridor:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Captain Soest is still waiting for me to report the promotion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delly didn't say anything, watched him leave.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until his back disappears At the corner, the woman’s expression was stunned and she whispered to herself: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Captain Soest...”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room where Leonard’s red gloves squad was temporarily stationed, Soest, who had just become a “smart witch”, saw this savvy subordinate coming in and lost his documents. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, you have been promoted. Congratulations to you, first make a dream review of the target. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Isn't this the task of the local ‘nighter’?” Leonard caught the file and asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have a lot of things lately, there are not enough people, please help us." Soest did not care to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard did not ask more, immediately bowed his head and flipped through the documents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that caught his eye was a photo, and the middle-aged gentleman above made him very impressed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dawn. Dontes..." Leonard's pupil slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows this gentleman and knows that the other is an undead monster that survived from the Quaternary, at least to the level of the Holy One, even stronger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he also knows my secret, knows the identity of the old man... Leonard instinct raises his hand and squats down the temple:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain Soest, I just promoted, spirituality is still uncontrollable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way..." It was only then that he found himself making mistakes and turned his head to another red glove. "Alber, you come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s called Albert A 30-year-old man has a yellowish color, a slightly pale skin, and a physique that is not very strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard sighed and handed the documents to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, his heart suddenly stunned: Will Albert be badly affected by the dream of entering the undead monster? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he regretted that he should do this thing himself, at least he knew the danger and had to deal with the other party and not offended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn. Dontes should not do anything to Albert... If he has a radical reaction that causes Albert to be abnormal, then his problem immediately It will be exposed to our eyes, and with the strength of the church and the condition of Beckland, he can't live away from this metropolis... Leonard quickly calmed down, and the channel is graceful. Dontes will use it more softly. The way to circumvent the dream review. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled a chair and sat next to Albert, seemingly reading the newspaper carelessly, but he always looked at the other side to prevent accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160 Burklend Street, in the master bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein in the dream suddenly wakes up and knows that "outsiders" are coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review of the "Night of the Night"? He looked around and found himself in the semi-open room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he heard a loud knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in..." Klein tried to make his voice look like a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handle turned, the door opened, a yellow-haired man in a black trench coat and a thin body came in, it was the red glove Albert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bakerland Police Department Superintendent." Albert presented the documents at random and sat across from Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter, police officer?" Klein entered the state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that due to the "nightmare" ability, he should behave normally at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alber has a stack of papers, and his voice is low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dauen Don Tae, male, Desi County..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recounted the information he had collected so far, and finally asked:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
