			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See "Mr. Fool" Mr. smirk, "Justice" Audrey and others have to regain their eyes and no longer ask questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this kind of situation that only gives hints and no explanation, they don’t feel any problem. The existence of the god level often has similar habits. When you give, it is not even a hint, but a revelation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the big man like Mr. Fool, just one name is enough. We can't understand that the level is not enough. We need to try and try more carefully... ... "Justice" Audrey is increasingly looking forward to the situation after becoming a "psychologist." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I remember that there was a text like 'Redemption Rose' in the semi-abandoned temple?" "Inverted" Alger looked sideways To the "Sun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick nodded without hesitation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes In the corner of a mural, written by the words of the giant language, we took a certain time to crack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Giant language derived The text..." "Upside down people" Alger did not care about this detail last time, but at this time had to associate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy Jack is suspected to have derived from the Sunia Sea...the words of the giant language...Alger’s request, with a line of words . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words belong to the source of the ancient languages ​​of the northern continent, meaning:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Redemption Rose.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sun” Dairik’s careful look, suddenly a bit stunned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It's very close, but it's not the same at the end of the suffix.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Inverted man', is this your text? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Dairik reproduces the words on the mural.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" . "Alger gave a positive answer," the language itself has evolved, and the ones you find should belong to earlier types. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of linguistics, this type of ancient Fossack is widely regarded as a feature of the Solomon Empire... Historian Klein gave it in his heart. The most correct answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted" Alger paused:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What about the contents of the mural? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was not responsible for the area, and did not look at it before departure..." "Sun" Dairik was a bit shy.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger’s expression nodded nodly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking for an opportunity to figure out, there may be a key point in it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! Dairik felt more and more that things were not so bad.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that he relaxed a lot, "Justice" Audrey was a little curious and asked a little doubt: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. hangman", the little boy named Jack, if you are the child of the 'listener' you describe, why can he communicate with the 'the sun'? ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the word "redemption", she completely determined the language and Lun language used by Silver City, which is different from the common language of all countries in the North and the South. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above the fog, everyone can communicate very smoothly, without any gaps, relying on the power of Mr. "fool"... Audrey I praised it in my heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger looked at her and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Jack has become such a horrible monster. What else can't be changed? Believe me, sometimes, the language is very easy to get, just a matter of a second or two."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Audrey blinked and felt that he had exposed his own experience and knowledge in the mysterious field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter lags behind, the Tarot party begins to follow the usual steps, and "Justice" Audrey looks to the bronze long table: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Mr. Fool's, this time there are three Russell diaries, I still owe seven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, "Magic" Firth is busy following: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Mr. Fool', I also received a reply, down There will be a new Russell Diary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Klein responded with a chuckle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Sun" next to Dairik suddenly felt ashamed, because he participated in the exploration team, he did not have time to go to the library to read the information last week, remember history The details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the simple process, Klein picked up the three-page diary that appeared, and began reading with expectation:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On August 8th, the first time I was invited, I entered the White Maple Palace and participated in the dance held by His Majesty the King.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These nobles really TM luxury, food is pursuing novelty, what roast swan, what sheep ** cake...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I have to say, I was very surprised at the beginning, the world Noble, um, only for the nobility, still very clean, bathing quite often, the toilet paper is still a prototype, completely different from the medieval aristocracy on earth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I originally thought that this was the effect of the existence of a true God, but someone later told me that this was an improvement that had to be made because of a certain threat. The extraordinary person of a sequence can spread the plague with dirty habits. I don't know which route is which sequence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My first thought at the time was that there were pits in the brains of the nobles? Since I was afraid of the plague, why not clean the streets where the sewage flows, why not perfect The sewer system, why is it a slum?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the same city, there is a plague there, can it be okay?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the case of water, food, people, or one-way flow, it may be ok...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, some plagues can be transmitted through the air! When I am in a high position, I must promote urban construction and environmental clean-up. Even if I don't consider the plague, living in such a stinky city is very responsive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I have been summoned by His Majesty tonight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought, From the earth, accepting equal education will not be humble and calm, but in fact, still very nervous and excited, unconsciously bent down and bowed his head, of course, I know that I and the king are equal in personality... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the charm of power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the whole page is everyday, But the Emperor still succeeded in teasing me... He is also a person who pursues... It is also said that even if he is born in a modern society, facing a high person, he will still be afraid and pleased with people who can influence his own destiny. Ryan’s mouth is slightly hooked, and the mood is a lot easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the second page and continued reading:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"November 10, coming soon The promotion sequence 4 is about to become a demigod.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After this time, as long as there is no loss of control, my life level will change qualitatively, no longer short-lived, Of course, different routes have different states for different sequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am faced with two choices, one is the 'alchemist' of the 'generalist' approach, and the other is the 'mystery of the 'secret man' approach "At the end of the year, I still haven't changed the road, because the 'hidden sage' is a very dangerous existence, but I always suspect that he is not a true god, and the person may be lower.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
