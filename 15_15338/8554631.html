			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike Joseph pulled out his handkerchief, covered his mouth and coughed several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog in the factory area is thicker than other places, yellow in the middle of the sky, as if floating dust, occasionally exudes a pungent smell. It is unbearable for a journalist who has long been used to Beckland's air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head to Klein, who also had a low cough:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have always supported the government The establishment of the Kingdom's Air Pollution Investigation Committee supported the establishment of the alkali industry prosecutor, but I only know today that the problem is so serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If no effective measures are taken In the future, it may lead to tragedy." Klein tried to get through the blocked nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the whole Beckland will be enveloped in a fog with a line of sight of no more than five meters, and the evil spirits are likely to come in such a scene, or be born ... he silently added a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler did not understand their conversation, cleared his throat, led reporters and detectives to bypass the caretaker, and sneaked into a lead-white factory. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are mainly women workers here, they are busy without protection, and there is obvious dust in the factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the "small particles" floating and floating in the air, Klein seems to have seen the poisonous gas, and the young women without masks are the same. The lamb that is headed for slaughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, he is like returning to Tingen, back to the process of helping Sir Deville to deal with resentment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have witnessed the future of a female worker here. Some of them have a headache in their heads, some people are blurred in sight, and some people are changing. In the end of the hysteria, some people have a blue line in their gums, and eventually, they become blind, or die very quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a large bloody sacrifice ceremony, but the target is the flashing money symbol... If the Aurora, Rose School and other cult organizations can make good use of it The thing, as Llanus did, the problem was big... Klein covered his mouth and stared quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike Joseph whispered in amazement and anger:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can this be?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can they do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sometimes have been concentrated in various newspapers and magazines Have you discussed the poisoning of lead, they are not prepared to do anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A mask is reluctant?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These factory owners are murdering!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a journalist with a sense of justice, although the age is not small, the style is rather embarrassing, The acting is also very good, but still retains the initial heart... But how can he understand the situation of lead poisoning? Yes, I have forgotten it. I have let Sir Deville widely publicize the dangers of lead poisoning in various newspapers and magazines... It seems that he has done a good job, but for some people, the lower class people die two. What is it? Some are people waiting for a job! Klein thought with a heavy heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a veteran journalist, Mike did not lose his mind, quietly observed and asked several shift workers, and left the lead-white factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, they entered one factory after another, and they were confused by the dirty environment and the high-intensity labor. Near noon, Klein suddenly found a lot of people gathered outside a factory in front of him, mainly women, who were excitedly shouting and trying to break into inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Mike questioned Old Kohler in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ran to the factory and mixed into the crowd. After a few minutes, he returned to Klein and Mike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They want to smash those new machines!" Old Kohler gasped, first said the point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Mike was not responsible for similar news before, and he didn't know much about it. Klein vaguely guessed the reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler pointed to the factory road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a textile factory, they want In exchange for the latest textile machines, the number of people responsible for maneuvering will be reduced. It seems that, as if to say, one third of the workers are to be fired!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The women workers hope to get rid of the machines and get back to work. Otherwise, they will probably not survive, or they can only be street girls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike's mouth was opened. From the point of view of the mouth, he vaguely wanted to say "stupid", but he didn't say anything at all, only looking at it silently, not even getting close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go back, my survey interview is almost done." A long time later, Mike sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three immediately turned around and went to the factory area, silent all the way, no one spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it’s time to separate, Mike glances at Klein and opens his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say, if you turn off the unprotected lead white factory or bring their boss to court, can the women workers find something else to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein thought about it seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it’s just a few, the problem is not big, but some women workers may endure hunger in the process of finding other jobs. And cold, gradually losing labor because they have no savings at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you close too much in a short period of time, plus the application of new textile machines, passive It will be a disaster for those who have lost their jobs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in the Beckland factory area, there may be thousands or even tens of thousands of unemployed workers. There is no food and clothing, wandering on the street like a living corpse, or lowering the salary requirements, vying for the jobs of other workers... I don’t know how many people will die in the entire Eastern District. Or it will be more difficult, it will be the same scene as hell, even if there is no extraordinary power in the world, it will bring great disasters, and now, the evil spirits are secretly screaming, waiting... Klein will be a lot of words I swallowed back in my stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike became silent again, paid 10 pounds and 6 sules of compensation, and took the carriage to leave the factory area where the smoke was everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the carriage and went away for a long time without speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was a night lover, he knew and had contact with the lives of the poor, but he was not as impressed as this one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All-round, three-dimensional observation, a human abyss is completely presented in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eastern District is really dangerous everywhere, hiding the fire, and it may be ignited by a cult organization if you accidentally... Klein has been indulging for a few seconds: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Kohler, I would like to ask you to help me pay attention to all aspects of the Eastern District, um, in your spare time."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will pay you, so that you have the money to establish friendship with other workers. Every week, we have a fixed time to meet in the previous cafe."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler’s eyes suddenly brightened:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No problem!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He did not mention the price and fully believed the kindly detective Mr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
