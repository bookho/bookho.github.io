			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, isn’t it awkward? When I heard Allen’s request, Klein almost made a blushing month on his chest, but eventually he resisted the impulse and responded very seriously to each other:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Perhaps some of my performances have caused you misunderstandings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I must tell you that faith is a decision and will not change. Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen raised his arms and made a sorry gesture:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sorry, I misunderstood your piety, I should not make fun of your faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, the difference in faith does not prevent us from becoming friends." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein put away the disguised expression and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Fossac and Fenetport, they are not established. They can only accept one kind of faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the fact that multiple churches coexisted For more than 4,000 years, Lun and Sri Lanka to open up a lot in this regard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't wait for Alan to answer, he pretended to transfer the topic at will:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You later Have you seen Will. Anthony? It is the child who has been cut off by a leg and said that your luck will be worse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that the night I will definitely follow the clues provided by Allen, so some curious endings are, curious about the change of Allen's fortune is the child, or the tarot card in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I have never seen him since he was discharged from the hospital." Allen shook his head affirmatively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pity that the night-time person can look for it according to the address registered by the hospital, but I can’t rush into it... Of course, the child may have moved away long ago. ... Klein and Allen chatted a few words, ready to go to the underground shooting range, familiar with the revolver attached to the ordinary bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, two acquaintances came in at the door, one is a member of the Kingdom Air Pollution Investigation Committee, the shareholder of Coim, Mrs. Mary, one is gram Ryan’s landlord, Mrs. Starling Summer, they all wore relatively light skirts and looked younger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the rules of the club, each member can only bring one person in, so Mary's maid and specially hired bodyguards are left in the reception hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein politely greeted him and said hello, politely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Two ladies, you are as beautiful as ever, but they are different from the usual beauty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary, who has recently contacted many great people, smiled slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Russell said that life lies in sports, and Stalin always stays at home, dealing with those trivial matters, even if she goes out, she only attends the banquet and listens to the opera. The body is a lot worse than before, so I took her to play tennis and squash."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her higher bones, she saw a The members of the House of Commons and the two members of the Beckland Region chatted in the corner, so they headed to Stalin: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I met an acquaintance, used to play Say hello, you can go to the library and wait for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Compared with Mary, Starling is obviously beautiful, but facing that Female She has become quite tame and respectful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mary got out of the distance, she lifted her chin and looked at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Moriarty, have you been busy recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I was working with a lot of detectives to help the police department investigate the serial killings. In the case, we made a certain contribution and got a lot of rewards.” Klein answered “true”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Really?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What does the murderer look like? Why did he kill the ladies? The newspaper was very vague.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I must abide by the confidentiality terms." Klein expertly found an excuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can’t tell you that it has a black fur with a smooth, smooth tail and likes to run on all fours... Klein spit in his heart. One sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starlin nodded with a slight regret, then asked curiously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How much bounty did you get?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot of us have divided up." Klein did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there 50 pounds?" Starling asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Kline "honest" beheaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stalene. Somerton smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are more than I imagined The income is high, you are really a capable detective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this kind of good thing may not have one in a few years." Klein smiled and shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, you have proved your ability." Starling blinked. "Next Sunday, I will be with Luke. I have a banquet at home, I hope you can come, um, sorry, this is very presumptuous, then I will let my maid send the invitation to your hand, huh, this banquet has many unmarried ladies to attend, their Fathers or mothers have relatively decent jobs. The family's annual income is all over £200. Some of them also work part-time jobs that can be done at home, such as typists, who are very good women."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, this is a blind date banquet... Mrs. Starlin recognized my ability to make money as a detective, so I am going to introduce a girl to a single person? However, in her eyes, I can only match this level of women? Klein flashed a lot of thoughts in an instant, but considering the need to maintain the relationship between the neighborhood and the trouble of preparing his own dinner, he smiled and agreed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an emergency, I will participate on time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starlin Yan Yan smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I and Luke are waiting for your visit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is no longer embarrassed, leaves her, and enters the small library of the club, while Klein Step by step in the practice of shooting a gun in a small closed range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 9 o'clock in the evening, Klein sat at his desk and looked at the air The blushing moon gradually penetrates the clouds, revealing that there are no more missing figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red "Tulle" like water slowly sways, time passes by, and by 10:00, he hears the illusion of illusion sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to distinguish, Klein can guess, this should be from the "Magic" Miss for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brushed the curtains together, extinguished the lights, stepped back four steps, entered the fog, and reached out to touch the deep red stars that were shrinking and expanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the moments, Folsic’s vague figure appeared in the chair with the symbol “Layer of Layers” behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed and got up and saluted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Mr. Fool, you I saved me once again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not something that needs to be taken care of." Klein responded with a very light and light tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls secretly stunned and sat down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palace of the giant's residence, silence quickly became the main theme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Foss returns to God, she suddenly feels that this atmosphere is somewhat oppressive and makes people uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the party, there are Miss "Justice" and "World", they are not afraid of no one to talk, and now, only me and "Folly", how? Do it, feel the pressure is great! I have to say something, I have to say something, I can't sit like a fool... that's Mr. "Follyman"! He certainly won't care about anything, but I am nervous and very restrained! Folth suddenly found the feeling of being alone with the boss at the time of entering the workplace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Klein is not an audience, but also clearly sees the "Magic" Miss's restraint and uneasiness, so smiled: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe you can talk about how you became an extraordinary person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, how to get an "apprentice" formula and The bracelet... Klein silently added the true point of the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falth relaxed a bit and recalled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was almost three years ago I have just graduated from the Bakerland Medical School."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the help of my father, I entered a very well-paid private clinic. Oh, my father has settled in East Byron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the safe passage to the Southland has been discovered, the young people of the kingdom have begun to take their footprints. Sprinkled to every corner there, my father, as a bottom officer, went to East Byron, chasing wealth and power, and my mother and I were left in Bakerland, living a widowed father’s life. Oh, for a few months, there was a ship bringing a letter from afar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This situation is not uncommon in the kingdom, I know an old gentleman. He has five children, but either in the archipelago, or in West Bylang, in the Pas Valley, in the Hagati Prairie, they have their own business and have their own Court and wealth, but forgot that there is still a father who is waiting for them to return."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My mother was seriously ill when I was reading grammar school. I have no choice but to watch her die in the hospital bed, and my father returned to my letter after a month, telling me that he already has a new family in Dongbailang and welcomes A new life, he gave me all the properties of Beckland, and gave me some extra money. I think he should be a bit embarrassed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; As a best-selling novelist, Fulth has mastered the skills of East and West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was idle, quiet, and never interjected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her, Fols breathed a sigh of relief and continued: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In short, my father passed The retired officer's club introduced me to the Youssef Clinic. The salary there is really rich. I have a good time, but I am a bit anxious about the future. Therefore, I have been working hard to follow the senior doctors and work hard. Money, until I met an old lady who often came to see a doctor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is very lonely, no children, my partner died a decade ago, I have some Sympathize with her, often talk to her and chat with her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One time, I was surprised to find that she was able to cross the wall, which made me enter A new world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old lady said that this is the legacy of his husband, she vaguely mentioned, as long as it is not a family, it seems There will be no curse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not long after, she was seriously ill, she asked me if I wished Being a person like her, I was very young at the time, and I still had a lot of fantasies in my head, and I agreed without hesitation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She gave me a recipe, And let me guard her body after her death, take away the illuminating items that will suddenly appear, and this is the legacy she gave me, which can be used as the main material of the potion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, she gave me this bracelet, when I am not in the most dangerous time, don't use it, and don't care too much about the full moon slang. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
