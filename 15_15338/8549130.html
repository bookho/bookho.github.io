			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan was determined, Zhou Mingrui had a heart, and the fear, embarrassment and insecurity were huddled in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, he was in a mood to carefully examine the residual memory of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui habitually stood up, closed the pipe valve, looked at the wall lamp slowly dimmed until it went out, and then he sat down again, unconsciously rubbing the yellow of the pistol The copper runner, while holding the head side, quietly "aftertastes" in the darkness of the dyed red, like the most dedicated audience in the cinema. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps influenced by the passage of bullets, Klein’s memory is like broken glass, not only loses coherence, but also lacks content in many places, such as workmanship. Where does the exquisite revolver come from, whether it is suicide or homicide, the phrase "everyone will die, including me" in the notebook, is what it means, two days before the incident, did not participate in strange things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only these specific memories have become fragmented and incomplete, even the mastery of knowledge. In the current state, Zhou Mingrui believes that Klein if When I returned to college, I was afraid that I couldn't finish my job, even if he actually left the campus for a few days, and he did not relax at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After two days, I will attend an interview with the History Department of the University of Tingen..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu The University of the Kingdom of the Kingdom has a tradition of not directly staying in the school... The instructor gave a letter to the University of Timing, a letter from the University of Beckland..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui silently "watching", the red moon outside the window slanted, gradually sinking until the east has a shimmer, the horizon is stained with gold . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the room inside was moving out, and soon, the footsteps leaned against the isolation door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melissa woke up...she was as punctual as ever." Zhou Mingrui smiled slightly, influenced by Klein’s memory, and had a Look at the feeling of your own sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I didn’t have a sister...and he spit it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa is not the same as Benson and Klein. The enlightenment education was not completed at the Sunday School of the Goddess Church. When she was at the age of studying, Lu The Kingdom of Enmity promulgated the "Primary Education Law", established a committee for the middle and lower education, and provided funds and increased investment. However, in the past three years, under the premise of incorporating many church schools, many public primary schools have been established, strictly maintaining the principle of religious neutrality, and are not involved in the storm. The Lord, the Goddess of the Night and the dispute between the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of tuition for three pence a week in a public elementary school is quite expensive compared to a Sunday school that uses only one copper penny, but the former is only weekly in the week. One day of study, the latter has to go to class for six days a week. From a comprehensive perspective, the price is almost free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa is different from most girls. She likes gears, clockwork, bearings, etc. since she was a child, and is determined to be a steam mechanic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder brother Benson who has suffered from cultural losses and understands the importance of education is like supporting Klein’s university and supports his sister’s dream. After all, Tingen Technology Schools can only be regarded as secondary education, and there is no need to accumulate in law schools or public schools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July last year, the 15-year-old Melissa passed the entrance exam and became a member of the Steam and Mechanical Department of the Tingen Technical School. Raised to nine pence. At the same time, the import and export company that Benson worked for was affected by the situation in the South China. Both the profit and the business volume were greatly reduced, and the staff had to be laid off. More than a third, in order to keep a job and maintain a life, Banson can only accept more arduous tasks, must work overtime, or go to a bad place to travel, just like these days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t think about helping his brother, but he was born by a civilian, and he was admitted to the ordinary grammar school. When he entered the university, he felt strongly about himself. Insufficient, for example, Gussack, the source language of all countries in the North, for the children of the nobles, for the children of the rich class, it was the content that had to be learned since childhood, and he did not come to the university for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory of the elder brother and sister jumped in Zhou Mingrui's mind, and the handle turned, and the door of the room opened. He woke up and remembered that he was holding a revolver in his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a semi-regulated item! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will scare children! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, there is a wound on my head! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Melissa is about to come out, Zhou Mingrui, while holding the temple, hurriedly opened the desk drawer and threw the revolver into it, making a bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Melissa heard the movement and looked over in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is at the most youthful stage, even if she can't eat anything good, her face is thin, slightly pale, and the skin is still full of luster, exudes a girl's breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the sister’s brown eyes and looking into it, Zhou Mingruiqiang calmed and picked up the things near his hand, then calmly closed the drawer and covered the revolver. Exist, and the touch of the other hand in the temple position makes him make sure the wound has healed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a silver-white pocket watch with a vine-leaf pattern from the drawer. The top of the lid was lightly pressed and the lid popped open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the father of the three brothers and sisters, the most valuable item left by the Royal Army Sergeant, but second-hand goods are second-hand goods after all, and will come out from time to time in recent years. The problem, even if it was repaired by a watchmaker, was the same. This made Banson, who likes to bring it up, to go out and go to the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that Melissa may have a mechanical talent. After mastering the theoretical knowledge, she began to use the tools of the technical school to slap the pocket watch. Recently, Claimed to fix it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui looked at the cover and bounced open, saw the second hand pause, and subconsciously turned the top, intending to wind the pocket watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he twisted a few laps, but the sound of the clockwork was not heard, and the second hand remained motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be broken again." He looked at his sister without saying anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa glanced at him without expression, hurried over and took the pocket watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood in the same place, first pulled up the button at the top of the pocket watch, just turned a few laps, then a stunned second hand walked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, shouldn’t it be time to adjust? Zhou Mingrui’s expression suddenly became sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the bells of the cathedral in the distance came from the door, six times in a row, long and ethereal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa listened to the ear and pulled the button at the top of the pocket watch up, then twisted continuously, and it took time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." She said shortly without a bit of emotion, then pressed back to the top and returned the pocket watch to Zhou Mingrui. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui smiled back and politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa looked at her brother deeply, turned to the cabinet position, took a toothbrush, towel, etc., and pulled out the door to the public bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did her expression have a sense of disgust and helplessness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caring for Mental Disability Brother's eyes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui shook his head and smiled, slammed the cover and slammed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeating this kind of action, he thought of a problem in a divergent way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the silencer, Klein committed suicide, um, suicide for the time being, his suicide was absolutely not small, and Melissa was separated by a wall. aware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
