			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi dropped the splint and straps into the trash can and moved the left arm:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The general provocation of pirates is abusive, and I am different, it is targeted insult.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This must have a lot of intelligence And rumors, have enough understanding of the object you want to provoke, the only way to use only one sentence and one action, let him lose his mind, burn his mind with anger. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused for a second:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like 'steel', you marry him It’s a shit, and his father, mother, or captain will not be of any use. However, if you make such an action and give a word, he will definitely become a bull with red eyes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Daniz pressed his hands to the waist and made a "top" action, shouting with extreme contempt:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"婊子! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......I want to beat him...It’s a "provocative"... Sure enough, "Steel" Maviti has that tendency and hobbies, 啧... Klein looses the fist of Panasonic's consciousness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is called professional provocation. "Daniz's hand summary concludes, "If you encounter a beast, a monster, or a guy who is out of control and unable to communicate, I can take the initiative to exude a feeling of disgusting them. This is extraordinary ability. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person with this extraordinary ability is not particularly embarrassed, but is especially able to escape and dodge. Obviously, you belong to the latter... Klein is I was vomiting in my heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi finally didn’t have to worry about the injury of his left arm, and he was very happy. He said:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I set the trap is also very powerful, but unfortunately, you do not agree with my plan to hunt 'Steel' Maviti. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein controlled the mouth of the mouth that he wanted to twitch and responded calmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still have opportunity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What opportunity? Daniz curiously asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The opportunity to set traps for extraordinary people like 'Steel', one-on-one, I will help you introduce. Klein smiled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Daniz couldn’t speak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He is very clear that for a guy who is not afraid of shooting and is not afraid of fire and is not afraid of flooding, the trap is often ineffective.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz laughs Two times, turned to look out the window:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The weather is clear...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Does it mean that the Cavitowan snake is completely dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein "hmm", did not hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz breathed a sigh of relief and hesitated: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what, after This time, the city’s large-scale search and arrest, for a long time, there should be few pirates who dare to come to Baiam, and this must include the 'blood on the top'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You and the captain's plan to hunt him may have to be interrupted, so big in the Sea of ​​Sonia, it is difficult to find a fleet that deliberately hides whereabouts, and they can go to the foggy sea, the raging sea , North Sea, Polar Sea. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is so easy to kill a pirate general on the ocean, the church and the military must have already completed it! Let me return to the "golden dream" as soon as possible." No. Daniz has a few words in his stomach.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassured, I have a solution, and this will be your job... Klein asked quietly :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has spent 12 pounds to get the radio ticker from Firth, just because he was busy with the "Poseidon", he has not taken care of this, and has not transferred it from the heap of debris above the fog to the real world. At the same time, the sums of Miss Justice and Mr. Hangman were all credited, and Klein’s net worth expanded to 7085 pounds plus 5 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wealth is enough to buy a large, productive estate anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t want revenge, find a way to return to Earth, I can retire... Klein thought with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain’s opinion...Daniz squeezes out the smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although theoretically Say, the captains should have entered the 500 nautical mile range, you can try the 'death ritual', but you know, the waterway is not absolutely safe, the pirates must be careful enough, always pay attention to not being used by the military and the church. The boat is caught and often needs to be circled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think it would be better to wait for the day to use the 'department ceremony', so as not to waste energy and materials. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. "Klein didn't say anything or not, and turned to the bathroom.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to go out again today to find another real opportunity to play.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of German Sparrow, Daniz breathed a sigh of relief.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure First privately contact the captain and persuade her to let me return to the "Golden Dream" to use the "Golden Ritual" in front of you! Galman Spalo is a person who likes to go out, I have enough opportunities and Space, huh, he won't like to go shopping? Daniz grinning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the Church of the Waves, Alger Wilson went straight to the Ralph trade firm and found the boss who was reading the newspaper.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He is very clear in front of the formal dress, bow tie, glasses, very graceful middle-aged man is a senior pirate, secretly supporting the resistance, devoutly believe in "Poseidon" Cavitewa <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "anything, our ghost ship captain? Ralph put down the newspaper, his right foot on his left leg, and laughed leisurely.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is an illegitimate child, his father owns both Lun and Fossac The adventurer of the bloodline, the mother is a local aboriginal. He started his career as a pirate, then turned into a black-and-white trader, and established a vast network of contacts, in the Governor’s Office, in the City Council, in the police station, I can get a steady help.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing about Ralph’s question, Alger almost frowned, because the attitude and tone of the other party were quite abnormal. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This abnormality means a state that does not meet Alger’s expectations.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, The sea god "Cavi Tuva" is completely out of the way, there will inevitably be a corresponding bad sign in all parts of the Rosde Islands. If the honest believers can detect the wrong, or full of anxiety, or heavy pessimism, how can it still be easy and natural!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger did not directly mention Kavitova, hehe laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know where Kovalo is recently? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covaro is the pirate captain who has the legacy of the Blood Baron. It is said to have been a sailor on the "Black Emperor" and is the "King of the Five Seas" "Nest's peripheral forces.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows? But certainly not in Byam, otherwise he has been caught in the first two days of the investigation. "Ralph shrugged his shoulders. "I heard that his ship went south. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger actually had a meeting with Kovalo, and just deliberately started the topic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Alger is not too anxious, because he already knows that Mr. Moon has obtained a bank acceptance bill. If it is taken out before the deadline, it will be discounted and a large interest will be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, thank you for your announcement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Alger pretended not to know what happened:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many places, the 'Poseidon' statue is broken by himself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not witness similar things, but could make some reasonable inferences based on the church's documentary files. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——In many colonial islands, in the countries of the South China, the pseudo-god like Cavitewa was killed by the Seven Churches, and they What happens after death, there are corresponding records. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relph nodded calmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, there is such a thing.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is not bad news. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expression became fanatical:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because God has reappeared in the earth, Have a new image! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God has reappeared on the earth, with a new image? Alger’s eyes have always been, and I feel that this is both reasonable and out of his Unexpectedly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the reaction of the Storm Church, he can be sure that Cavi Tuva is dead, and which "Poseidon" is now responding to believers?<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contacting the previous judgment, he quickly got a bold idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "fool" Incarnation?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a new identity with the fall of the "Poseidon" Cavitowa? It can penetrate the seal and directly affect the identity of the real world. ?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the real purpose of the "world" to come to Baiam?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶, "Mr. Fool" is really a big deal!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger swallowed his saliva in a hidden way, and pressed his inner excitement.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Azure Winds" hotel, Klein, who has not yet left, saw a stack of cash handed over by Captain Allan:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is your reward, for a total of £100. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't mention how much Greman Sparoo got, "flame" Daniz took how much, only said the total amount, how to distribute it, is the other party Internal things.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military is still very generous... Klein screamed, took the thick pile of cash, and instinctively took out two 5 pounds. The banknote was thrown to Daniz.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His wrist sank and eventually took two more 10 pounds without expression.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German.Sparo is still very fair, more just than fair Airland...Daniz is pleasantly surprised to accept the reward, only to feel dry during this time The wallet was filled again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German Sparo, who was wearing new clothes, asked Ellan in a boat cap to ask :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The news came from the storm church, saying that in the middle of the night, at the door of the church, people who posted the issue of Laticia and 'Poseidon' Cavitewa were, 'flame' Daniz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
