			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is still not dead? Did she escape? She still wants to help Prince Edsack revenge? At the moment of seeing Terry, Klein, standing behind the curtains of the master bedroom, almost didn't control his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has had some speculation based on the previous dialogue, but when the facts are in front of him, he still feels that this is beyond his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he does not need dream divination, he can still recall that before the Bakerland smog incident, Terry talked to her part, at that time, she, I can't wait to get rid of the control of Prince Edsack, get rid of the manipulation of her fate by the black hand behind the scenes, and feel that everyday life is full of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a witch who was originally a man would sell his soul to the evil spirit in order to help Prince Edessac revenge? What is the bridge of the three-story romance novel! Klein's mouth twitched. "Looking" to the butler Walter threw a bag of food to Terry. "Listen" and saw him swearing a few words, then turned and went outside the hidden passage. At this moment, in Klein’s own perspective, Mr. Mahat’s family had a figure turned over, along the shadow of the street, quickly approaching the entrance to the sewer, positive It is Hailuer who has the magical items of the "stealers". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will run into Walter...this is like the entrance to the sewer, which is clearly the main entrance to the lively market! Klein looked down and almost lifted his right hand and covered his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the entrance to the sewer, Hailuer watched for a few seconds, then moved the manhole cover and climbed down. The whole process was completed without any delay. Feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When stepping on a slightly slippery ground, she follows the rusted iron pipes and the slowly flowing sewage river for a clear and rapid advancement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, her back was cold, her spine was cold, and her hair was standing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Hailuer seems to fall into the surface of the frozen river, only a large amount of cold and quickly occupy his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was horrified to see that she took the initiative to move in the other direction and went straight to the wall with iron pipes, and this has nothing to do with her will! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear quickly filled Haier’s mind, and she finally got rid of the stiffness of her thoughts and poured all the spirituality she could control into the necklace on her neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This necklace is lined with seven green and transparent stones, separated by an equal distance, surrounded by a small circle of diamonds, in an absolutely dark environment. , still flowing with subtle fluorescence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, one of the stones lit up, and the green glow reflected the beautiful face of Hailuer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused by the action of the wall, and her feet were awkwardly stepped forward, and they were taken back one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Hailuer felt that the coldness in the body appeared a short sluggishness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not hesitate to use the spirituality to light another transparent green stone, raised her right hand, pointed at herself, and the wrist jerked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, she has some mysterious symbols and patterns in her mind, and the spirituality and vocal cords have also undergone some temporary changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stole the very power of "sorrowful screaming"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hayul is about to open his mouth and sounds desperately, but feels that his hands are out of control again, slamming, forcefully, quickly , caught her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her screams became a whimper that only exists in the mouth, her feet are lightly stepping, and a few times come to the wall and turn into a The road was broken, and then it was in the pure darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She struggled, but it was useless, and even the necklace on her neck was hard to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hairel’s dark brown eyes are full of fear and unwillingness, and two drops of crystal tears begin to follow her eyes, slowly going down Sliding down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time he quietly turned into the Daun Dontes House at 160 Burke Lund Street, Hairouer suddenly found control of the body, only to see that the terrible coldness disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She first raised her hands in amazement, took a look at the night vision ability, and then looked around in horror, as if the darkness of the sewer was hidden, countless Clear monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hairel immediately touched the necklace in front of his body with his right hand, and stood up carefully, approaching the entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ran wildly without panic, always guarding for attacks from the depths of the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, she returned to Berkrund Street and saw the iron-black gas light poles illuminate and illuminate the road with traces of rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hairluer just stepped up and ran to his home. Halfway through, she suddenly returned and nervously and panicked to move the manhole cover to the closed state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, she walked back into the garden with the shadow of the street, and entered the balcony of the bedroom with gas and water pipes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until then, she really had extra thinking ability, wide-eyed, subconsciously watching and watching, and the body gradually showed obvious tremors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She raised her left arm and tried to wipe her face with her clothes, but she paused on the way and changed her handkerchief from her pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hayur still has basic coping skills, not pure rookie ... In the sewer, Seignor wearing a triangular hat and wearing a dark red coat revealed his figure and said silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, under the control of Klein, he re-hidden his body and entered the hidden road where Terry was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Resentment" just got close, and Teres, wearing a long black dress, raised her head and outlined a smile that was weak and stubborn: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you are not malicious.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lady is not bad luck. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was aware of the things of Hailuer and found "resentment"!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The figure of Senilol suddenly appeared, and he laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe just killing her will have more trouble. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, he would like to report to Terry because he knows what bad things the other party has done and how she teaches the "nickname" passengers. With the crew, let them kill each other at sea, knowing how she made an innocent life die in advance, but after discovering that Teres was investigating the mystery of Prince Edsack’s death, Klein had a new The intention is to drive the witch to do limited cooperation with her in this matter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery of the death of Prince Edsake is almost equal to The truth about the Baker Rand smog!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigating this matter is definitely dangerous, and getting people involved can make me feel embarrassed, afraid that they will be hurt, Even if she dies and lets Terry do it, there is no such psychological burden. The crime she committed should have let her go to hell! The only problem is that she may just be investigating Prince Edsac. The mystery of death, planning your own affairs, must beware of this, so as not to be used, In the catastrophe... Klein thought about it and let Seneol move forward two more steps.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry faintly looks at the middle age ahead Men, chuckle a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you are malicious, let's do it, Mr. Senol. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, in the senses of the secret couple, there are countless around Terry, the invisible silk is fluttering in the air, and her own pale face The skirt sits darkly in the middle, like a spider lying in the core of the screen, but full of temptation to make people feel pity.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
