			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ridiculous fields of the suburbs, the old butler Finkel is flying fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lost his hat, and the meticulous white hair was sloppy, and the surface of the clothes was muddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, call... He paused a bit, gasping for the rear, and found that there was no one in the air, a little peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when he twisted his head and was ready to change direction, he found that there was a more person in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure is wearing a hooded classical robes, black eyes are hidden in the shadows, and the face is dull and expressionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finkel’s pupils shrank and immediately opened his mouth, trying to read a Guhemia word, but suddenly noticed that his nose was disappearing, his own The sound is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His expression suddenly became a little more desperate, and then the whole person was like a smudge in the void, wiped clean with a rag, and there was no residue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie! Auntie! cough! cough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the fatal attack that Mr. A is about to launch, Klein is suffering from illness, headache, and difficulty in manipulating the flames and jumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he could not even make an air bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear of unknown results occupies his heart, and the dangerous premonition from the "clown" makes him "see" himself to split and disintegrate for the tiniest light Grain, maybe there is no chance even for the resurrection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Klein grabbed his hand into his pocket and held an item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most dangerous situation he has considered in advance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to rush, "Magic" is also prepared, will not be confused in the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took out the Azick copper whistle, put it to his lips, and blew it hard in sneezing and coughing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any pre-motion, he glanced through the white-boned fountain through the vision, and quickly sketched into a huge messenger with a dark flame burning in the eye socket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the book in front of Mr. A also stopped flipping, and the sound coming from a long distance came to an abrupt end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of green brilliance emerged, the nearly four-meter-high white bone messenger split and split into countless pure spots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind it, Klein was only able to collapse in the power of the original place, and the figure wearing a black double-breasted long dress was shrouded and turned into yellow. The sand-like statue was blown away by the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the white spots are scattered, like tearing the most confetti. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s figure appeared on the other side, half-squatting on the ground, unable to control and coughing loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no Bone Messenger to block it first, he has no time to suppress the disease for a short time, using paper people to substitute! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after such a toss, his illness is more serious, and he almost loses his ability to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Mr. A, who failed the critical strike, suddenly coughed up and coughed more than Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He groaned in pain, and his mouth was filled with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough and cough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coughed up a bunch of broken internal organs and squirming flesh and blood, then he tried to open his mouth and tried to smash them into the mouth and forcibly eat back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? Klein was a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not prevent him from holding back his cough, raising his right hand and aiming Mr. A’s head with his left wheel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he vaguely realized that the physical injury of Mr. A can be maintained by the treatment of flesh-and-blood magic, but the impact and counter-attack of mental and spiritual can not be compensated in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. A should have switched to another extraordinary ability to slowly heal the wounds of the spirit, but he was driven by hatred, forcibly suppressed, chased over, and thus continued After consuming and using the extraordinary ability beyond its own load, the situation deteriorated and it broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shot all the bullets in the revolver. The light of brass, light gold, silver and white quickly crossed the distance between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes him regret is that the process can’t control sneezing and coughing, the bullets are not all hits, only two hits on Mr. A’s body, one drill Enter the forehead and launch into the torso. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of burning came out, but Mr. A’s head seemed to have no bones, just a combination of rotten meat, letting the pale gold bullets sink into it, soon Pause, failed to cause fatal damage, only to bloom in the sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mr. A lifted his neck, and the flesh in his skull was mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not die, not even suffered heavy losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to be a stubborn "Royal Bishop"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Klein took the initiative and turned, and ran away, no longer trying to attack. Mr. A was breathing, and bowed again, picking up himself and coughing up. Minced meat and internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sneezing and coughing alternated, and Klein ran over and sometimes rolled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he fled to the edge of the edge, which is more than fifty meters of cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cliff, the slightly turbid Tassok River is rushing, wide but calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not hesitate, and forced his feet to jump out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed down and felt the strong weightlessness brought by the free fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body tears the air, trying to adjust the posture in mid-air and become the standard action of diving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough! Auntie! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disease caused his body to tumbling for three and a half weeks, and the opening of the body and the adjustment of the palms were not in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beep, he fell on the water and fell into a thin piece of white paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper man is quickly moist, half-sinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the bottom of the water, Klein figured and shivered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His clothing has been soaked, and the remaining paper and the banknotes in the wallet are the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Mr. A, the disease has been alleviated... Klein thought with a lingering fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the last minute cough and sneeze subsided a lot, he didn’t even have time to use the paper man’s alternative method, he would smash visceral bleeding and die directly, of course, if that’s the case The cause of death, he felt that he could be resurrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the water between the feet, Klein created an invisible, hollow tube in his mouth, letting it out of the water and bringing freshness to himself. air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "spy breathing" performance of "Magician"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein’s mouth sucks, the nose screams, does not allow turbid gas to pollute the pipeline and enter the water directly. At the same time, he quietly walked towards the shore, hoping to avoid the follow-up of Mr. A in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this is not a city. The ability of "no face" can't be effectively played. Otherwise, Mr. A will definitely not find me again... ...Swift, Klein instinct flashed such an idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thought made him think of a problem, that is, Mr. A used the extraordinary ability to control the wind before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, this is the path of the "master of the storm"... This route is characterized by the wind, water, and especially the underwater activities... Underwater activities... "Shepherd" is too comprehensive and terrible! In the blink of thought, Klein’s heart almost stopped beating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is rushing upstream, no longer concealing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just emerged from the water, near the shore, saw Mr. A’s beautiful and fascinating face, and saw the scales covered with fish. Cracked out of the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red robes float on the surface of the mouth of Mr. A, and the eyes are like a real hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell! Can only fight! Strive to support the reinforcements arriving at the church, or Mr. Azick to get out of trouble! Kline, who had relieved the disease, did not hesitate to raise his right hand and prepare to make a snap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two looked at the same time in the air, almost instinctive reaction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a figure that quickly femininely feminine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure was wearing a hood, wearing a dark robe and looking at Mr. A with a dull look. Then, Klein saw that Mr. A seemed to have become a pencil drawing, erased by the eraser, and had no resistance. The desperate eyes hidden in the madness are inscribed in the minds of the only audience on the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...What kind of person is this! What kind of strength! When Klein thought about it, he found that the figure was facing his head and looked at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a beautiful face, but without the slightest expression, the black eyes are dark and deep, but lacking spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Klein’s heart, I thought I would disappear silently. I don’t know if there is a chance to resurrect, the woman’s mouth is slowly moving. , hooked up, revealing a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile? Klein was amazed and wondered that he was dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t returned to the gods, and the figure has faded in an instant, disappearing in the same place, and the sound of the flowing water is quiet and reverberating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bewildered to the shore in confusion, Klein climbed up and looked around, discovering that it was unusually remote, there was no road, no living, only a little muddy The river is flowing forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is over? Is Mr. A dead like this? The lady who was just now, was so strong that Mr. A couldn’t even make a scream. She smiled at me... smiled... maybe he? But in addition to the Pope's characters at this level, there are angels walking on the ground, and the characters at the level of the Pope will obviously not be in Beckland... Klein can't believe that he is free from danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so sad that he finally found a sense of reality:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be a church The strongman who came out, she arrived in time and successfully rescued me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I didn't inform Miss Justice in advance, they may not have time to act, then I am today A high probability will die in Mr. A's hand, I don't know if I can resurrect...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, there are also factors that I have been insisting on, delaying the battle to the present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not bad..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein breathed a sigh of relief and coughed twice. Start looking for a way out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exile! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man with a golden mask pointed at Azick Aegis and threw his figure into the void, not knowing where to throw it.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he turned to face the frowning of his own Ins. Zangweier.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No time We can't solve him so quickly! We must hide this as soon as possible, only exile! Do you want to be discovered by the people of the church? The man wearing a golden mask said in angrily.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
