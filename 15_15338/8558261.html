			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear the slightly surprised and confused female voice, Len was shocked and thought that he was seen by the true face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is calm, because he has changed his appearance now, is the "hurricane lieutenant" Qilingus, who is already dead, and Qilingus is crazy inside. The adventurer, Greman Sparo, is a big detective Sherlock Moriatti, and Sherlock Moratti is Klein Moretti. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not over yet, Klein Moretti is inside the "Foolish Man", is Zhou Mingrui. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't make sense that she can see through my essence directly, and how can I know such a small person as Klein Moretti... even if it is 'Hurricane Lieutenant' Qilin Gus, it is impossible for the helper of the 'disease girl' Trey to be so surprised! Can be specially protected by a pirate general of sequence 5 to deal with the enemy, at least the demigod of the sequence 4...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, this sentence points to Mr. Azick? The high-level witch recognized Mr. Azke who destroyed their cooperation with the royal family and Ins Zangweier in Beckland, or was Mr. Azke in a certain life in the past? Klein quickly cleared his mind and watched the sudden attack by Trey and her helper, and looked at Mr. Azick’s reaction with his eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He is not surprised at the emergence of a mysterious powerhouse. This is because Mr. Azick has already warned, and secondly, he believes that "the disease will be" Trey is not arrogant, and is almost assassinated and killed. If you don't know what the other party's purpose is and what forces are behind it, you will retreat when you have a high probability. You will leave the waters of the Rhodes Islands and seek help from the top of the witch sect.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He The only thing I didn't expect was that the helper of the other party came so fast that it seemed to be nearby, or there were magical items like “travelers.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with the feminine characteristics of sound With a sense of femininity, Klein suspected that he was a half-god witch.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick stood on a thick carpet and hesitated for two seconds. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tone is very uncertain... Is there a life before the big brother who spent time with the witch? No, can't think so... Klein first thought In the heart, I seriously repented in my heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed that "the disease will be" Trey is also a mistake, the previous determination and calm They all become doubts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a woman who is still not knowing where to come from:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I certainly know you, you should know me too. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick listened to the ear and shook his head and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I Lost memories of the past and again, they are on their way back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can remind me to help me wake up more memories, I will be very grateful to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the conversation between the two, the mistakes and doubts on Trey's face gradually subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She glanced at Klein cautiously, but was frowned by the face of the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Kiringus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful female voice sighed long:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last time we met, there were more than 1300 years. At that time, the 'original' and 'death' cooperation, set off a 'pale disaster' in the northern continent, you may have forgotten that we have fought against the saints and angels of the Goddess of the Night."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This history I know, there is in the diary of Russell the Great...Mr. Gate said that the ending was that the "original witch" was hit hard, until recently there was a sign of re-emergence, 'Death 'It is directly degraded, creating a violent sea, cutting off the north and south continent... The witch sect and the god of death have had such cooperation. No wonder this half-devil-level witch knows Mr. Azke, hey, she also lived at least one thousand four. A hundred years of monsters! Klein thought about it with all his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azke closed his eyes as if to squeeze the memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, he hesitated to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catherine Pepe莱?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, already a 'not old witch'? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very glad that you still remember me. At the time, I was only a weaker person than you." A figure slowly sketched on the side of the "sickness of the disease" Trey, wearing a simple, holy white robe with high openings on both sides, revealing a pair of flawless legs, skin-like snow, tender as a girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman's brunette blue eyes, clear and beautiful, has an indescribable charm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked to Azke Ai Gesi with a shallow smile on her lips:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After more than a thousand years, we can still meet alive, this is It is worth celebrating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Death Chief of the Bronte Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Azick is The "Death Archon" of the Byron Empire... Is this the name of the potion behind the "Death" route? This "not old witch" Katrina Pelle looks like thirty ups and downs, dignified and mature and mature... and so on, why should I think about this, her "happy" charm has reached this level? Klein was busy moving his eyes and almost relied on meditation to calm his emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Azick’s opening, “not the old witch” Katerina Pellet uses a beautiful voice like a song:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am wondering why you are constantly losing your memory.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember that you only have this path in the 'undead' stage That's it. I die every sixty years, come back to life, and forget the past, but you have already been promoted and got rid of this curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to you at the end of the 'Pale Disaster'?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, then The seven gods split and they are enemies. We all think that 'the original' and 'death' can succeed. Who knows, the proudest sun is bowing, and the most arrogant tyrants are also bowing, and they are soon united together. It didn't happen to be promoted. I may have fallen to the end of the war. I think that you should also be hurt and become what it is now. The fall of death is the biggest harm for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azk is silent, his face gradually reveals a less obvious painful expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, I can't remember it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, Klein discovered that "the old witch" Katrina Pelle is familiar and feels her. Suspended to guide Mrs. Shelen’s white robe woman on the road to the witch.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Catalina’s eyes turned and swept Klein, chuckling Azko Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then the purpose of your visit today should not be forgotten? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very curious, why did he assassinate Trey, is it for justice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The eye that the "not old witch" swept, the style is concealed, sweet and playful, like a young girl from an underage, and her facial features and temperament also magically set off this feeling, there is no mature lady The sense of violation, this moment, Klein sees that Katerina Pellet is a 16-year-old girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......She has been able to perfectly present the charm of every stage of women, and has a skin condition, a sense of temperament...not a "not old witch"... Ryan is already trying to use meditation techniques to fight the indescribable charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the initiative to look at the "disease girl" Trey:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know the rich businessman Jimmy .Neck?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may not know him. He once collected a collection of ancient documents related to death, he died in the hurricane 'The hands of Qi Lingus.' Kline said, "The hurricane lieutenant" Qi Lingus's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trey's blue eyes stunned, first fascinated, then brought with anger:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You come for that batch of documents?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really falls in your hands... Klein made a judgment based on the tone of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He replied indifferently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trey's small mouth inhalation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is Elaine? What did you do to her? I know she still Living, if she has a problem, my spiritual instinct will tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not try the sly tone, responded directly: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She has returned to Intis, she is about to start a new life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry A sinking, the storm inside the eyelids, the momentum of the pirate generals was fully revealed, but Azke looked at it at random, and she suddenly became awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a little bit of outline in her mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The batch was unearthed from the mausoleum of the royal family of the Bailang Empire The literature does fall into my hands.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I was not interested in them, simply flipped two pages and handed it over to the sect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, even if you succeeded in assassination, you can’t get them. I haven’t seen it at all, even if I’m psychic, I can’t repeat it, but unfortunately, I I can't bear my life, otherwise I should be able to see your disappointment at the time. It must be very interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein calmly said:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I won't be disappointed, I can harvest the soul and character of a 'painful witch', graze you and drive you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;In the middle of the conversation, he lifted his left palm and wore "squirming hunger" - it is now black gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tre’s eyes blinked, his eyes became extremely dangerous, like a provocative tiger, if not two high-ranking strongmen, she’s next to her. Maybe already shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Klein’s voice just fell, he noticed something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not playing Gelman Sparo, why should I use his people to set his style to speak... Klein was shocked, I wonder if I have been too involved in the game recently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must remember, I can only be myself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't be played for a long time, Being reversed by the character... This will lead to loss, which will be out of control! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly made a self-review and put the summary into the "no-face-to-face" playing code.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his short silence, Azk looked to the "not old witch" Katerina Pelle, saying in his voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can put that Is there a copy of the batch of documents for me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a big problem. Katrina looked at Trey sideways. "What are your requirements?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trezen stared at Klein, and his voice said a little dumbly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Tell me the whereabouts of Elaine. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
