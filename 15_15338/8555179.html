			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the power of the mysterious space above the fog, Klein quickly recovered his good mental state and continued to read the second chapter of The Spiritual Insight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the note, the traveler of the Abraham family claimed to have roamed into the depths of the spirits and met an old man wearing a lemon yellow robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s body is translucent and similar to the surrounding spiritual creatures, but his attitude is unexpectedly good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traveler of the Abraham family and the old man exchanged for a while, and accidentally learned that the other party turned out to be one of the seven bright lights covering the highest point of the spiritual world. "Vinitan has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vinitan tells the traveler of the Abraham family that his trait is rationality and adaptation, a symbol of the astrological field, and the corresponding gem is emerald. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is quite worried about a prophecy from himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking from the stars When the land is thrown, the earth will be torn apart, and everything in the world will cease to exist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks this is the final day of the coming two hundred years, all things are Can't be spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traveler of the Abraham family did not feel anything about it. He never asked more questions. Instead, he asked how to lift the curse of his family's blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yellow Light" Veneto tells him that in a sense, this is indeed a curse, but it has a very different essence from the curse in occultism. The solution is in the hands of an "apprentice" who is helped by a hidden existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also warned the traveler of the Abraham family that the day of the curse was the beginning of the real catastrophe of Abraham. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for what caused the disaster, he said that he was not clear, and that this involved the great existence of the god level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second chapter of "Spiritual Insights", the owner of the note also mentioned another thing that "Huang Guang" Wei Nitan said, "Net The masters of the Brotherhood of Light, the seven bright lights, often enter the real world, become humans through different ways, and teach the corresponding knowledge. Since the fifth period, many instructors in various fields have their Incarnations, for example, the greatest astrologers in the last millennium, have proved that the current world is the planet's Di. Forsman is the human embodiment of the "Yellow Light" Veneto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the note made a guess based on this, Russ Gustav, who is a mentor in many fields, may be the net light. Incarnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, he is not... If you really want to think so, then he is probably a green light... Klein raised his hand and licked his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this, he judged that the owner of the note would not be too old and extraordinary, and that the other person did not call Russell as the great emperor, this time Travel in the world should take place during Russell’s term as the consul, or just after the emperor has not been widely recognized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it is not excluded that the extraordinary people of the Abraham family refused to recognize the emperor outside the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A traveler who can travel the spiritual world, this sequence is not low, and if he is a high sequence strong, Mr. "Men" has long been rescued The so-called blood curse has long ceased to exist, so the owner of the note is the extraordinary of sequence 5, or the sequence of magical aids. 6... The Abraham family is declining, but not weak... Why "Yellow "When Vinnet's prophecy is very similar to the witch sect and the aurora's claims, will the end of the day come? From the point of time I have just calculated, is it only twenty or thirty years from the end? Klein frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Russell became the consul in 1173, and now it is November 1963, 176 years apart, and the "Yellow Light" Venitan prophesied at the time. It is two hundred years, considering that Klein's calculation is only a range, from the end of 24 to 50 years is possible (Russell called Emperor is 1192, stabbed is 1198). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the first two chapters of "Spiritual Insights" did not have any practical knowledge, they thoroughly opened up his vision and let him know the spirit. In many cases, I know the existence of Qiguangguang and the "Clean Brotherhood". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two chapters of "Spiritual Insights" are not to say that there is no practical knowledge at all. At least let me know that the real name of 'Yellow' is Winitan, knowing that its corresponding gem is emerald, knowing many details. Sexual things, I can design some rituals that point to it...but it’s useless for a while...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pondering for a moment, closing that This transcribed note returns to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has more important things than the psychic "Huangguang" Venitan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took out the stationery, lifted the pen, wrote a letter to the inventor Reppard, asked which part of the bicycle’s patent approval, and why it was not successful. Whether you need to find a lawyer here to help - with the establishment of the "Magician Code", the thorough digestion of the potion has not been more than two months, he must as soon as possible for the promotion sequence 6 "no face" Extraordinary material costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, "the sun" may be offered for free for "All Black Eyes", but the other one still has to find a way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as he knows, the corresponding extraordinary material of Sequence 6 is basically above 1500 pounds, and there is often no price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the two main materials, there are two kinds of unusually rare spiritual things in the auxiliary materials: the blood of thousands of hunters and the hair of deep sea naga. The price is also not beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really hard to make money, it’s easy to spend money... The extraordinary character of the 'wolfwolf' and the extraordinary performance of the 'interrogator' are just fine... 1 Sule 1 pence can't be wasted..." Klein got the envelope and put a stamp on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t need to count, he knows how much money he has now:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;624 pound notes plus 5 A gold coin of 1 pound denomination, plus 7 soler banknotes and some copper pennies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, and Miss Magic and Miss Hugh will pay 600 gold pounds for the extraordinary character of the "Sheriff", I hope they can get as soon as possible Make up enough money..." Klein silently blessed the two ladies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that you have a new circle of extraordinary people." The Sheriff's two extraordinary materials of the potion, and the price is very reasonable, a total of only 600 pounds?" Hume wide eyes, screaming and asking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just returned from the Eastern District to investigate who recently inquired about Ka Ping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, that is a very reputable seller. The only problem is that the assessment is very strict and I can't bring you to the circle in a short time. "Firth said completely true words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s good!" Hugh did not doubt the friend, and took two steps with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, her expression collapsed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, my money is not enough..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;False’s mouth twitched:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How many gold pounds do you have now?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Accounting for the initial remuneration of the commission of 30 pounds, a total of 310 pounds, still half the difference!" Hugh caught his own short blonde hair, "I think about it Think about where I can borrow 300 pounds... The bank won't give me such a bounty hunter loan, and the usury merchants have too much interest... Maybe you can find Miss Audrey?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She listened to her friend who recently bought the "Master of the Master" potion formula and spent a full 450 pounds, so I didn’t even think about borrowing from Forsy. money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are we all so poor?" Fols could not help but sigh, "Miss Audrey has rarely come out recently, seems to be busy with other things. It is not necessarily timely to borrow money from her. We can first find the Viscount of Glenlint. If it is too late, I will help you, I have 430 pounds, enough."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughing his eyes, slamming his head down, his voice said dullly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
