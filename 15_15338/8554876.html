			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence is sitting in the cubicle of a cheap café, and it’s hard to contain the Abraham family’s suffering over the years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since being split into small families and diaspora, the Presbyterians’ control of family members has dropped to a minimum, and a large number of Abrahams have brought in order to avoid curses. The influence, unwilling to go to promotion, always stay in sequence 8 or sequence 9, or even try not to become an extraordinary person, just want to be a common person with certain knowledge and certain wealth, to spend a lifetime calmly and beautifully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Presbyterian Church believes that this is an act that forgets the glory of the family, but there is no way to deal with it strictly, because that is equal to self-extinction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this situation, the upper echelons of the Abraham family emerged a trend of change, they imitated the life school’s mentoring system, cultivated non-family members, and hoped they After Jin’s ascending sequence, he could in turn help Abrahams to resolve the curse that existed for 1,560 years and retrieve the ancestor Bethel Abraham who disappeared in the Battle of the Four Emperors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan was very smooth at the beginning, and the apprentices who didn’t need to worry about the curse were swiftly stronger, constantly promoted, and shorted under the careful cultivation of the Abraham family. In a short period of ten years, there were several strong players in the sequence 5 among them, and in the immediate extraordinary of the Abraham family, there was no sequence 6. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The backbone is too weak, the branches are too strong, the seeds of tragedy are buried, and the ambitions of the disciples turn their attention to the strong seals owned by the Abraham family. Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their plot failed, but it also brought serious sequelae, all non-family members of sequence 6 and sequence 5 extraordinary think they are inside the Abraham family The status does not match its own strength, and it is not trusted to obtain the control of certain seals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of ripping back and forth, arduous negotiations, and compromising each other, an accident occurred. One of the series 5 "Travellers" called Boutis was "real creator." "The temptation to join the Aurora will lead to a terrible disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this disaster, the upper layer of the Abraham family was almost completely destroyed, and the few powerful seals were lost more than half, leaving only three, Lawrence’s mother Brother Richard died as a result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boutis has great benefits, not only collecting the extraordinary materials needed, but also with the help of the "real creator", successfully overcome the obstacles, stepping into The sequence of demigods became the "secret saint" of one of the five great saints of the Aurora. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the disaster, the rebuilt Abraham family elders reflected on the past many years of behavior, but could not find a solution to the problem, negative, mourning, despair and other emotions In the hearts of the few remaining family members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence is not willing to be in such an environment, not willing to face the sigh and repressed atmosphere every day, find a reason, leave the Presbyterian Church, come to Baekeland De looking for another mother brother, Lauro and his half-brother Sam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he suddenly found out that his father, this one, seems to have only himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is nearly eighty years old, and all the children died in the disaster brought by Buttis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just thinking about this, he is sad and unbroken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most painful thing for him is that he can’t see the hope of revenge, and he can’t see the dawn of family glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very old, and I have been traumatized before, and I don’t have to use extraordinary powers. It will bring out of control, or let the curse come... ...Where is the future of the Abraham family?" Lawrence took a sip from Fermer Coffee and fell into a long silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the rented house, Firth immediately enters the bedroom , locked the wooden door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat down to the bedside, adjusted her state, and whispered the name that represented hope and future:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Followers who are not in this era;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the mysterious ruler above the fog;"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the king of yellow and black who is in good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to pray to you and state what happened to me today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I met the husband of the old lady who made me an 'apprentice' Brother, he is suspected of being a member of a family..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have concealed things related to the mysterious realm, but I am worried that he has a strong divination ability. You can find out the complete truth..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Klein happens to be Above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the deep red stars representing the "magician" swell outwards, swaying, and heard the layers of prayers spreading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After figuring out the specific details, Kline finger tapped the edge of the ancient long table and silently said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Be very cautious, know to ask for help from the fool."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, your guess is correct, the sequence 7 of the 'apprentice' is called 'horoscope' People '..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recently studied the "Book of Secrets" and he quickly developed a plan to help the other party interfere with the divination program through rituals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to say that after the promotion of Sequence 7 and the book of Secrets, I am more and more like a real god above the fog, of course, For the time being, it’s just an empty shell...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking of it, I have performed many times in front of Miss 'Justice' and 'Inverted Man'. Perfectly blinded them, why there is no corresponding spiritual feedback, and the progress of the potion has not become faster. Is it necessary to be in the real world? Well, it may be that their audience's 'applause' is cut off by the fog, and it can't directly affect me, just like 'Eternal Liyang' and 'Real Creator' are difficult to penetrate the fog, find this mysterious space... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, the reaction between the fog and this mysterious space is very mechanical, not smart enough, lacking wisdom... but for me, this In fact, it is a good thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thoughts are mixed, Klein brings the corresponding knowledge to the old parchment, and puts the symbol of "magician" That deep red star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;False suddenly filled the boundless gray mist, while the sky lowered an illusory yellow-brown parchment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw the knowledge written on it, and her heart was calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "fool" Mr. shot, the gentleman named Lawrence certainly can't get the correct revelation in divination! Fols expressed sincere gratitude and was busy preparing for the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has seen many evil spirits, and she is not so trusting in the "fool", but the full moon curse allows her to rely on each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no more life than the loss of life. Without the help of Mr. Fool, I was out of control for the last bloody month... I live every time. One day, you will earn more than one day. This is the gift of Mr. Fool. When can he take it back? It’s best not to take it back... Fols took a breath and lit the symbol of the fool. Two candles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial steps of the ceremony are no different from those I have mastered until the candle is ignited, and essential oils, pure dew, herbal powders, etc. are put into the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the quiet and ethereal scent permeates the room, the faint smog envelopes the entire altar, and Fols follows the contents of the "Parchment". Adjust your body and mind, enter meditation, and meditation on the name of the "fool", over and over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monotonous and repetitive behavior, letting Falss, who is calm and calm because of his thoughts, slowly enters a state of mental sleep and spiritual divergence. The whole person is both embarrassed and keeps a strange lucidity, only to feel that the spirit is floating and constantly rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has certain similarities with the "difficulty" process achieved by means of foreign objects, but in many places it is different, which belongs to psychic A technique for communicating the higher level of the spirit to the extreme, and even allowing the extraordinary to roam the spirit world while preserving the peculiar soberness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some extraordinary people who are good at influencing the mind call it "artificial sleepwalking", they can use hypnosis and other techniques to let ordinary people enter this state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
