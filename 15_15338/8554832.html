			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting for more than half an hour to confirm that there was no unexpected situation, Klein and Emlin White left the lawyer of Jurgen and thought about the silence. On the way, I quickly arrived outside the 15th Minsk Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire Emlin clenched his fist to his lower mouth and coughed a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The remuneration has been paid and I hope I will not have a chance to meet again in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is very good, Mr. White, have you forgotten something important? Klein smiled politely: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will occasionally visit Bishop Utravsky, hoping that you will not be in the harvest church.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, I don't have to be busy trying to find a solution to your psychological cues. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White's expression suddenly became quite weird, and it took two seconds to raise his chin:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are many powerful mystics in our blood family, and I will write to them for help. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, he pressed his chest and gave a speech.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned and walked a few steps He suddenly slowed down, twisted his head, hesitated and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are, what are you doing?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beef bone radish soup, the kind of pepper that needs rice and specialties from the Fenetport Plateau. Klein breathed the scent from the room and said with full expectation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin frowned and shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chilli is not in the aesthetic field of the blood family. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, I can hardly imagine a vampire who eats pepper. Of course, I occasionally fantasize about a vampire holding a white hoe and carrying garlic and green onions. Klein whispered, pointing to the door and indicating that he was going to have dinner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White considered the second, sinking the voice, Discretion: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought about it for a long time last night and found that you didn't actually do anything. Why do you need to get paid? The old man will let me go at any time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s not like this, your parents entrusted The task is to find you, not to save you, and in the end, I found you. According to the agreement, the reward should belong to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, if I don't have a reminder, you may have to stay in the Harvest Church for a few weeks to know that you are free to leave and you can't detect yourself being Implied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are stealing my IQ?" Emlin's face was distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it’s clear... Klein smiled and didn’t talk anymore, since he opened the door and went straight to the kitchen, his brain was full of seductive soup. Juice, white rice, soft but not chewy beef, deep in the medulla of the bones, sweet and savory with meaty radish, and chopped Feiner Plateau peppers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fiery fragments, pink rose salt and green Bailang long leaves are also sprinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the early morning of Thursday, Klein arrived at the Eastern District as agreed Cheap cafes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Kohler, who is still wearing a thick jacket before, is sitting in the corner and matching a black bread with tea that can hardly taste tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein came across from him, took out what he had prepared and pushed it to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler looked straight at them, and for a moment he reached out his right hand and shivered and took it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repeatedly looked at it, raised his hand and wiped his eyes, and smiled out: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" At the dock, we carry heavy cargo, and do some troublesome cleaning on the cold and dirty water. One day is only about 1 sul..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full 15 Sule! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened silently, after a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have heard recently What? What happened?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler put away the funds, drank the tea again, pinched the corner of the eye:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have met a lot of dockers and re-established contact with friends I used to know when I was wandering. Some of them have entered the factory, and some are still going back and forth in the corners of the almshouses and parks. As I used to be...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Recently I don’t know where I came from, saying that since we believe in one of the Seven Gods, why not directly to the source The Creator prayed? He said that in everybody's body, in all things, he did not really die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray to Him for us to be redeemed, not only to enter into His kingdom after death, but to have a better life before life, for example, without having to work So hard, you can have cream every day, there is meat that breeds oil, every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...the embodiment of the variant creator that Aurora will spread? After the events of Llanus, they began to pay attention to the poor in the Eastern, Docklands and Eastern Districts, hoping to use them to achieve certain purposes? I don't know if the three churches have noticed this phenomenon...should be there... Klein put the butter between the two toasts and took a bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler said after a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Detective, follow your instructions I paid attention to the textile women workers. In the end, with the police joining, their struggle failed, but, huh, the leaders led the factory director, and one third lost their jobs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are actively looking for new jobs, some have become street girls, some don't know where to go, and the entire East is in chaos. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qilingus came to Beckland, this is the situation, then he came to the Eastern District to quietly kill one or two people every day. No one can find out, no one can notice... Klein sighed in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler continued to talk about some of the everyday insights:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the little daughter of Liv's family is missing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Liv? Klein confirmed that he had not heard of the name.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler said this: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It is the pulp-washing woman you and the reporter I met last time. She has been doing the pulping work with her eldest daughter and her little daughter at home. But yesterday, her two daughters were on their way back to the clothes and lost. One, the small one, really pitiful. She has been a widow for many years and has been counting on her two daughters. As a result... Hey, the police in the Eastern District will certainly not look too hard. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunate people tend to have greater misfortunes because they have no resistance to risk and the ability to change their environment... Klein’s mind suddenly flashes Such a passage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was as silent as a stone for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me Look at them, I am a detective, maybe I can help them find someone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...they have no money. "Old Kohler reminded me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein picked up his hat and cane:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joewood District, the house where the two ladies originally rented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh started the life of the bounty hunter, and Foss accelerated the progress of the new book, hoping to get enough money for the extraordinary materials needed by the "drama master" as soon as possible. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But writing a book is something that you can't write without thinking about it. Fols irritatedly grabbed his hair and decided to go out and take inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking around, she found herself unconsciously returning to a familiar place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her oblique front is the earliest work of the Joseph Clinic, a fairly large private clinic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After gazing for a while, Foer thought of the old lady who led herself into the extraordinary world, so she turned to the right side of the alley and walked close to the road. a street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This street is a relatively quiet place with deciduous trees flying on both sides of the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fols remembers that the old lady lived in the house on the 39th - she occasionally came to the door to give medicine or injections, and even helped some daily chores Busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s been almost three years, and it’s time to re-rent it out, maybe I’ve changed a few tenants... I remember remembering the relics at the time. At the time, I found a lot of notes recording mystery..." Fols walked under the plane tree with no leaves left, and slowly approached the house on the 39th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of her past experiences, she gradually got some writing inspiration. At this moment, she saw a thick coat, a veteran with a half-height black hat standing at the door of the house on the 39th, and pulled the doorbell three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, there was no one to open the door. The old man with a pair of blue eyes turned his head and turned and whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nobody..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly found out that he was not far away, looking forward to this side of Firth, busy Open the pace, go over, gently and eagerly laugh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful lady, do you live in this neighborhood? You know Lauboro and Anlisa ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa? Isn't this the name of the old lady? This house has no tenants recently? Fols said in a discretion: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if Mrs. Anlisa I know is the one you are looking for. She lives here and lives. For a long time, but passed away three years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Three years ago passed away? Lauboro?" The wrinkle only wrinkled The old man was busy asking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Her husband passed away earlier than her." Foers answered honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man suddenly stunned and immediately showed a sad expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He silently said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, kind lady.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the brother of Lauboro, who has been living in the county, because I haven't received the letter from them for a long time, so I decided to take a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you tell me something about what they have experienced in the past few years?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Alisa's husband's brother... will it be the descendants of the family in her mouth? Fols suddenly wakes up and smiles and responds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thinks fast What can be said and what can not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man pointed to the side of the road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
