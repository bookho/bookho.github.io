			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly longer iron black revolver of the barrel retreated a bit, and a touch of pale gold flew out and went straight to where the target would be next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the illusory black line suddenly stopped and seemed to be observing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From his state, he did not realize that danger was coming, but was simply attracted to other situations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gray-white rabbit jumped out of the lush grass and fled into the distance. A large tree in front of the Unreal Black Line was in the sound of shooting. Then fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a person's high position, the trunk has huge irregular holes and pure blazing light golden flame, the whole directly from the break! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the "Stolen Bell" is like a small caliber gun, and it is more penetrating! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusory and dense black clew was obviously shocked, and the instinct disappeared in place, and it surfaced on the surface of a shallow pit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His figure is inevitably sketched out, is a pale face, deep eye sockets, twilight light brown man, about forty years old, left on the lips Two black beards and an old triangular hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of this man, Klein is no stranger, the reward of the other side always appears in front of his eyes, step by step superimposed into a clear impression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blood will be above" Senol! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Ruone alone, his bounty is 42,000 pounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already sneaked into Bayam! Is this to pick up Turan von Helmoshine? After the big scientist was discovered and died, he joined the mission of the Rose School for me? I seem to have more weaknesses, but before I trigger it, I can't know exactly what it is... The thoughts flashed, and Klein saw that Senegal's figure disappeared again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the trace of the existence of this "blood admiral" is still obvious, corresponding to his illusory black clew in Klein's eyes like the firefly in the night There is no difficulty in identifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom black line swam around him, with the dewdrops in the morning, the fragments of the glass, the inexplicable icicles completed again and again. Jumping, and soon the distance between the two sides is very close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not wait in the same place, doing a small flash, so as not to be greeted by the rose school demigod in the fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seneol’s performance made him understand that one thing is that “resentment” must possess the goal and directly manipulate his body. Within a certain range, although the half-god of the Rose School can be completed at a greater distance, it may be contemptuous, perhaps afraid of accidents, and did not do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certain that Senolion is the "resent" of Sequence 5! Klein kept changing his position and waiting for the distance to become more appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the "above the blood" was slightly slowed down, and when the goal was chosen to be in the air, the gloves of Klein's left palm suddenly became deep and dark. It seems to be constructed from layers of pure particles one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a devil word in his mouth that was full of filth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Slow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniol had a hunch that he had violently changed his position before Klein opened his mouth, but within the entire range of seven or eight meters, all Everything is still, and his avoidance has not worked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the scope impact! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniol’s figure is slow, once again outlined in the real world, Klein raised his right hand iron black revolver, pulled the hammer and put the other Incorporating the "targeting circle". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "Warning Bell" revolver, he saw that the other side was full of various colors, the white point representing the weakness is not at the head, just above the larynx. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without hesitation, without hesitation, Klein pulled the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, an unreal black line swam to the side of Senol, and he took him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood above the blood" immediately slanted, pale gold bullets rubbing his neck and flew over, hit a rock in the distance, hit it Smash! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniol’s neck ignited a golden flame, burning him to raise his head and open his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sharp scream burst immediately, filling Klein’s ear, shaking his head and humming, and his body paused and stagnate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible souls do not know when they have been flying in Senigal, and then mixed with the cold wind, from heaven, from the surface, from The enemy flew in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Klein’s two eyes, each has a girders, and the pale man in a red coat is flying fast and will be complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a snap and the body was instantly covered by a red fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed the "respiratory soul" before the real possession, disappeared in place! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the ten-meter tree, the wild grass burns, the fire becomes bigger, and the sky is set. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaps out from the inside lightly, lifts the "Sentinel Bell" revolver again, and aims at the place where he originally stood, more than twice the normal spirituality. Infused into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slaughter"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled the trigger, the pale gold bullet split into countless pieces, with a sacred flame, swept the area where the muzzle was aimed, the invisible ghost ghosts It was like being swept by the sun storm, and without any resistance, it was screaming and burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniol’s possession failed to succeed, and immediately knew that there would be a counterattack in the next, immediately flashing inside a piece of glass, trying to escape, but “killing” "The bullet storm brought over a considerable range, including this piece of glass! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the huge sound, a few golden flames hit the glass, failed to hit it directly, just brought the burning damage, Seignor Jumping again on the "mirror surface", it appears on the surface of a drop of dewdrops in the distance, and there are many rotten wounds caused by the power of purification, but it is not serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too lucky? Sure enough, Seignor had a magical item that would make him lucky... There were only three purifying bullets... Klein brows and wrinkles, running agilely, seemingly chasing each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he knew that he would face a member of the Rose School, he replaced all the extraordinary bullets in the revolver with the purifying bullets for the souls of the souls. A total of six, and now he has fired three shots! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first shot, Senegal was rescued by the rabbit who accidentally broke in, the second shot, was just run to his side next to the rose school demigod One, the third shot, in the slaughter storm, he happened to be in the gap of the debris, did not suffer any major damage, the degree of luck simply made Klein unacceptable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Kline was not frustrated, but turned his looks and body back to the form of Gilman Sparo, which was the wrong situation, immediately Throw out a lot of "Poseidon" field spells, create certain fluctuations, so that the "Sea King" in Bayam City, Yann Courtman can be acutely aware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sequence of 3 deities if you arrive, facing a rose school demigod, a hostile pirate general and a background mysterious, but with the military The adventurer who must contact must first deal with which side, the answer is no doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the messenger, Klein believes she can retreat into the spirit world in a timely manner, free to choose to participate in the melee or leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the telegram last night, Klein didn’t find a chance to escape in the middle of the night because the “Sea King” could give him a “safety feeling”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
