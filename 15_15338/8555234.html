Klein looked up and looked at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that he is getting a disease now, afraid of the doorbell ringing, just like the symptoms of fear that the phone has a phone call in the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the newspapers and magazines, and look at the empty sauces that have nothing left. Klein got up and walked to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not yet grasped the handle, he already knows that Dr. Allen is outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you not have to go to work? Klein groaned and reached for the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Allen, today's fog is gray." He piled up with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen is still a cold expression, but a little more anxious and fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed the gold-rimmed glasses and refused to say hello, straightforward:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock, I dreamed again! I dreamed of Will. Ander!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? Klein was almost there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not right? Authentic thousand paper cranes are here, on the fog, and I fold the paper cranes in the night, and you can continue to dream of Will Anse with a poor quality paper crane that is folded by the night. Ting? This is not scientific, no, this is not occult... Klein becomes serious and immediately asks: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are the previous dream?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this time it’s not that scary." Allen calmed down a bit. "I dreamed of the Green Cemetery. Do you know the Green Cemetery?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know." Klein replied succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was outside the Green Cemetery and caught a group of students who danced in the spirits and a eccentric lover of Copthorne, from the back. The man got another copper whistle that could summon the messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen took a cold breath and continued:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I dreamed of Green Tomb In the woods outside the garden, I dreamt of a birch with a circle of skin removed from the waist. Will Ansein sat under the tree and looked at me quietly."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then?" Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen shook his head: "The dream is over here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a piece Strange things... Is Dr. Allen dreaming of nothing to do with the thousand paper cranes? No, if it doesn't matter, there will be no change in the dreams after changing the paper cranes, and I will use the thousand paper cranes to divination on the fog, and get the corresponding revelation... Klein considers道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is no longer within my understanding, Allen, what are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Allen exhaled the heat in the air for white fog: "I want to go outside the Green Cemetery to see, now, during the day, can you protect me? I will pay the commission fee, 1 pound "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now explore the scenes that have appeared in your dreams? There should be no surprises during the day... Klein thought: "I can accept this commission, but I suggest that you go to the church before you, and tell the familiar bishop of your dreams." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen "hmm", immediately said with some doubts: "Why do you always suggest me to go to church? I know, you explained before, to In a very logical way, if there is magical power, the church that can always dominate the human world must be the one with the strongest magical power. If not, then the church can at least get psychological comfort and corresponding resources, but one It’s not too weird, why do you recommend me to go to church?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein considered it for two seconds, replied in a serious way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Really?” Allen listened to his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein suddenly raised his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just kidding.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allen, take it easy, I will change the clothes, the amount, and the dishes. "#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't wear a thick coat and talked to Allen at the door for a long time, his body was blown by the cold wind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with this opportunity, Klein went to the bathroom, went over the fog, and divined the degree of danger of the commission, and got the conclusion that there was almost no risk.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you harvest a very dangerous revelation, his intention is to rely on the Goddess Church to rely on the commission.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... ... <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Princeton Hill area, starry church <br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "Shylock, why do not you ask Maid? As a big detective, you can afford several servants. Allen asked Clane to enter the Church of the Night God in the largest church in the Hillston area, and asked with doubts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his on the carriage want to ask something, but could not find the opportunity to cut into this topic <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Klein sighed heavily and said:. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp "Allen, I will tell you a story. There was a detective. He hired two maids, a chef and an assistant. He had a good job, but one day he took over a case. The murderer was successfully locked. The murderer was a very brutal and very ferocious person. He sneaked into the detective's home with revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Detective is a fighting expert, and he was only slightly injured, but his servant died two.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allen, do you understand? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand. "Allen's tone has obvious sympathy." Sherlock, you still have this experience. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the protagonist has nothing to do with me, this is just the story I just compiled... I can’t tell you directly, I’m involved in a lot of weird Mysterious events, there are often secrets at home, and it is best not to ask the servants. Klein looks straight ahead and sighs long.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The cleaning of his room was mainly carried out by the maid of Mrs. Starling Summer, twice a week, only for the most basic cleaning, once for 1 sul.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;In the talking room, the two have already entered the hall of the Star Church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the style of the Goddess Church, dim, quiet, and sparsely lit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forefront of the hall is the holy platform inscribed with the dark sacred emblem. The star is inlaid with a self-illuminating pearl, and the red gems are used to make the blush. In the month, the rest of the place is all dark night.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance, there are a little bit of stars, blushing, Outside the sacred.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Klein felt that this was not as good as the design of the St. Serena Church in Tingen, the hall was dark, and there was a light in front of it. One round and one fist-sized hole, it makes people seem to see the starry sky directly, and it produces awe from the heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, such a design also There was a problem. At night, the effect was gone... Klein randomly found a position to sit down, took off the half-high silk hat, and leaned on the black hardwood cane, and Allen continued along the aisle and went straight. The confession room was looking for the bishop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in such a hall, looking at the believers who were praying around, Klein’s heart was suddenly quiet.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, I only entered the church of the goddess for the third time... He laughed at himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter County, quiet church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Mitchell put on a black trench coat, put on red gloves, and entered the room belonging to Senior Deacon Crestel Sesima. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Congratulations, officially become a red glove, may the goddess protect you." Sesima painted a red moon on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still covered his mouth with a tall, vertical neckline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s my pleasure to praise the goddess." Leonard raised his right hand and clicked clockwise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sésima did not say much, straight to the topic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to your own request, I Put you in the Soest squad, he is a 'soul teacher', has his own magical items, the extraordinary weapons you need, I have also told people to help you.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have recently been primarily responsible for a demon summoning case, and to take care of some clues, such as the ones that have happened in Beckland in succession, related to the Tarot ritual. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, His Excellency. Leonard didn't have any opinion on this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be the beginning of my revenge...he said silently in his heart.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western District, outside the Green Cemetery.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Klein accompanied Dr. Allen and walked in the nearby woods for a long time. From time to time, he was coughed by the dust and dust that fell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no such a tree, and the dreams cannot be completely reflected in reality. "At the end, Allen himself is a little uncertain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, I am good at finding things... Klein pointed his direction with a cane:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go over there and do the final effort. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Allen breathed a sigh of relief.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked for a while, and Allen suddenly stopped and pointed to the front:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where, there! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen meters away, a birch tree with a waist off the skin stood there quietly, as if waiting for two people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is exactly the same as my dream. Allen said very positively.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled with a little vigilance:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can not have Will. Anthony. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allen was close to the birch tree, frowning for a while, and suddenly pointed to the tree roots:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Will. Onsetin was sitting here at the time, he had his hand pointing at the dirt below! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pointing to the soil below? Klein stood beside him, looking down at the place where there was almost no dry grass:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to dig it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen nodded. "I have found it here, always confirm what is there, Sherlock, you go to the cemetery and borrow two shovel." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or I stay here, you go to the cemetery, I am worried that there will be an accident. Klein said cautiously.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. "Allen didn't quit, and immediately left the woods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, he squandered money, came back with three shovel and a gravekeeper, and started Try to dig.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
