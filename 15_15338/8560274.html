			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the disappearance of the messenger, Klein thought about which half-god he could contact in a short time, and found that he had no more, so he turned his attention back. The next question on how to do it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole city 'broadcast' will definitely make 'Haiwang' Yann Courtman looking for Hull At the same time, Mo Xiu was trying to search for the traces of 'Poseidon' and his followers. It was easy to be noticed when he went out in the middle of the night, so he could only stay here and wait for the day.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The ship of tomorrow can't take a ride. If there is an attack on the way, it is very likely that people will be injured, and this is not enough." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm... summon the underwater creatures, leave by whale boat, take the rest of the island, reef rest and transfer, and arrive at the next port... since 'orange Light says that you must be in close contact to detect the traits. If you want to enlarge the sensory or devotee of the 'destination goddess', it will not exceed one city, or even one block, which can explain me. Why did Olavy encounter a trap when he arrived?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you leave Beyam, you should get rid of 'gaze'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein’s thoughts became clearer, the radio ticker suddenly heard another signal!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was busy , quickly record, and then use the codebook to translate into the corresponding letters to form a word.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the content of the telegraph signal is presented on paper, ink Dark black:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw you... Klein read this sentence, and there was a sudden rise in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byyam, an ordinary residence not far from the Governor’s Office.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the spacious basement, a candle burns quietly, and the dim light shines around.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver Viper" Odell has taken off The robes with hoods were dropped, and the middle-aged man, who was shuddering at the opposite side, said with awkward voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Senior I don't know why Helmosh will be known for the real hiding place. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior wears an old-fashioned triangular hat, his eyes are deep, his face is pale and scary, more like evil spirits than humans, he raises his hand The two black beards on the lower lip, the light brown eyes swept over Odell's face coldly, and the eminent adventurer couldn't help but lower his head.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a few seconds of silence watching the other side, with a white trousers and a red jacket, the "blood on the top" was low and dumb: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "In less than three minutes after the telegram, there was a message that was spread throughout the city, and the content was part of the telegram. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suspect that another party has begun to pay attention to the radio and got our codebook at Old Quinn."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, yes, it must be like this!" "Golden Cod Snake" Odell is busy with the road, hoping that "the blood will be above" Do not think that he is not doing enough to let the great scientist Hermos Due to loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very aware of how cruel the pirate general is to the subordinates who are doing the wrong thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seneol swept Odell and sneered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But no matter what You have failed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it wasn't you, and your mistress, gave me a lot of happiness, I will let you take your intestines out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to take a telegram and tell the eavesdropper who may or may not exist. I saw him and let him spend the night in fear and anxiety. This is the only thing you can do at the moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odell heard the words, suddenly sighed with relief and looked at the eyes with fear. And the bloody altar on the table at the back of him, replied respectfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Senigal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just thought he would be part of the sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Odell exits the basement, "the blood will pass" Senigal turned to look at the altar that covered the head, the internal organs, the limbs and the blood, Bjord’s more respectful attitude towards him: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jacks, is the ceremony successful?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Success, just wait for God to respond." A cold, unfeeling voice came from Mumbry, who was hanging around the altar. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the curtain seemed to have the same vitality, and the left and right sides were rolled up, and they smoothly knotted themselves and landed in the center of the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slightly transparent figure did not know when it came to the side of the altar, his skin color was brown, and the wrinkles on his face formed a deep gully, white hair Sparse like the autumn leaves, it seems to have lived for many years and many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the candlelight in humility, and the tan eyes were motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The top of the blood" Senigal did not dare to speak again, standing next to the Jacks, waiting for the altar to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the fire of the candle is dyed in a variety of colors, each of which seems to correspond to the different desires of the watcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the altar, the internal organs, the limbs, and the blood are automatically windless, stacked one after another, and the candle melts like a state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for them to form a tree of flesh and blood that was not high, and the surface was rugged, like the outer shell of a walnut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! thump! thump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside the fleshy tree, it seems that the heart is beating, strong and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Senegal couldn’t stand the noise, the flesh and blood tree withered, rotted into mud, spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where it originally existed, there was a flesh-colored, wet, sticky ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the ball grows out of the limbs, grows his head, and becomes a palm-sized humanoid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has no eyes, no nose, no ears, only a hole in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that mouth, the gray mist spit out, and shrank back, many times in a row, without stopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man named Jakes devoutly and ruthlessly whispered the "desire mother tree" and explored the weird villain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sound, the candlelight is completely extinguished, but for the "resentment" with night vision ability, this does not affect their seeing things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The top of the blood" Senigal stared at Jacks and heard the adult say low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For this ritual, we have prepared for too long, and the gift of God can help us to sense the present existence in a larger context.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Then we can find him accurately with the glasses made by the members of the Life School!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, Jake took out a monocle from the inner pocket, which seemed to be no different from normal, but shimmered in the darkness. The brilliance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jacks, what do we do next? Senigal asked reverently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacks, who had deep wrinkles, thought for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "After dawn, go find the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he has a strong helper, we will monitor him, avoid him from getting out of the scope of the sensor, and then patiently wait for the arrival of Sie'a.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he is not protected, he is also very weak, then we will do it directly. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
