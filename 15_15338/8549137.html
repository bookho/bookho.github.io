			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free? Free stuff is the most expensive! Zhou Mingrui is silent and intends to wait until no matter what additional services are available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have the ability to divination I am crossing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Zhou Mingrui leaned back into the low tent behind the woman with red butter on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tent was very dark, with only a little light infiltrating, faintly showing a table full of cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman wearing a pointed hat is not affected at all. The black long skirt wanders around the table on the water, sits opposite and ignites the candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint yellow swaying, the tent seems to be dark, and the moment is a little more mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui sat down silently, his eyes swept over the tarot cards on the table and found his familiar "magician", "emperor", "down" The main card such as "hanging people" and "temperance". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it true that Comrade Russell is a ‘predecessor’... I don’t know if I am a fellow of the empire.” Zhou Mingrui’s mouth was slightly moving, and he was embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t had time to read the cards that have been opened on the table. The woman who claims to be “divined” has reached out and put all the tarots together. The pile was pushed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You come to shuffle and cut cards." The circus diviner said in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to wash?" Zhou Mingrui subconsciously asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red butter color on the diviner’s face squirmed, revealing a light smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone's fate can only be divined by himself. I am just an interpreter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui immediately warned and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you understand that there is no extra charge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a keyboard folklorist, I saw much more similar tricks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diviner obviously stunned for a while and then muffled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Free. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui let go of his heart, put a revolver in his pocket and stuffed it a bit, then calmly extended his palms and skillfully shuffle and cut cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." He placed the washed tarot cards in the middle of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diviner grasped the hands and carefully watched the cards for a while, and suddenly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Excuse me, forgot to ask, what do you want to divination?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pursuit of the first love, Zhou Mingrui also studied the Tarot, without hesitation :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Past, present, and future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a kind of tarot Divination cards, three cards are arranged in turn, symbolizing the past, present and future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diviner nodded first, then upturned his mouth and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That please Wash your cards again and understand what you want to ask in order to wash out the really symbolic cards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You just played me...do you want to Stingy, isn't that I always stressed that it is free? Zhou Mingrui's face muscles twitched, took a deep breath, took back Tarot, reshuffled, cut cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this all the time?" He placed the cut cards on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing." The diviner held out his finger and picked up a card from the top, placed it on the left hand side of Zhou Mingrui, and the voice became more and more dumb. "This symbolizes the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This symbol is now." The diviner placed the second card in front of Zhou Mingrui. ,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked up the third card and placed it on the right hand side of Zhou Mingrui:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This symbolizes the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, which card do you want to see first?" After doing all this, the diviner lifted his head and looked at Zhou Mingrui with gray-blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look first ‘now’.” Zhou Mingrui thought a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diviner slowly nodded and turned the card in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This card depicts a man wearing gorgeous clothing, wearing a smashed headgear, a cane on his shoulders, a luggage hanging on his head, and a puppy pulling behind him. Young people, the serial number is "0". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Fool." The diviner whispered the card, and the gray-blue eyes were fixed on Zhou Mingrui. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foolish? Tarot's zero card? Start? Contain all possible starts? Zhou Mingrui and Tarot junior enthusiasts are not counted. They can only make a rough interpretation based on their impressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the diviner was about to open, the tent door was suddenly opened, and the strong sunlight came in, stabbing the Zhou Mingrui instinct there. I narrowed my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you pretending to be me! Giving people divination is my job!" A female voice snorted, "Go back! You have to remember, you are just A animal trainer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The animal trainer? Zhou Mingrui adapted to the light and saw that the door was a woman wearing a pointed hat, a black dress and a red butter color. It was taller and thinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman sitting in front of him quickly stood up and shouted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mind, I just like this, I have to say that sometimes, my divination and interpretation are quite accurate, really..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said The skirt, from the side around the table, quickly left the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This gentleman, do you need me to help you interpret it?" The real diviner looked at Zhou Mingrui and asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui moved his mouth, sincerely asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Free?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...No," the real diviner replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it." Zhou Mingrui inserted his palm back into his pocket, held the revolver and banknotes, and bent over to wear the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is true, even found a beastmaster to do Tarot divination! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t want to be a diviner’s animal trainer is not a good clown? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui quickly threw this thing behind, and bought 1 pound of less good lamb in the "Lettuce and Meat" market. I bought some peas, cabbage, onions, potatoes and other items. Together with the previous bread, I shared 25 copper pennies, which is 2 Sule 1 pence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The money really can't help but spend, poor Banson..." Zhou Mingrui not only did not take out the two banknotes that came out, but also took the original trouser pocket. A penny in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed with such a mouth, no longer thought about it, and hurried back home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the staple food, you can carry out the transfer ceremony! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the second floor tenants left, Zhou Mingrui was not in a hurry To carry out the ceremony, the words "Fusheng Xuanhuang Xianzun" and other words were translated into Gussack and Luenwen. If the original spell is not effective, then try the local language again every day! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, you have to consider the difference between the two worlds and the problem of entering the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the translation of ancient Greek prayers and sacrifices for Hermes, Zhou Mingrui is difficult to complete because of insufficient vocabulary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, he took four rye breads from the paper bag, one placed in the corner of the original coal stove, one inside the bottom of the mirror One place where the two walls meet at the top of the cabinet, and one where the debris is stacked on the right side of the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a deep breath, Zhou Mingrui came to the center of the room, calmed for a few minutes, then dignified and walked counterclockwise to the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step, he whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fusheng Xuanhuang Xianzun "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second step, he sincerely meditates:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fusheng Xuanhuang Tianjun."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third step, Zhou Mingrui breathe and whisper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fusheng Xuan Huang God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth step, he spit out the turbidity, meditation: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fusheng Xuan Huang Tianzun." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the homing, Zhou Mingrui closed his eyes and waited for the results in the same place. There was expectation in his heart, there was anxiety, hope, and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you go back? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will it work? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen unexpectedly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness in front of the eyes is dyed with the deep redness brought by the light, and Zhou Mingrui’s thoughts in his mind are rushing and it is difficult to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he suddenly felt that the air around him seemed to stop flowing, becoming sticky and strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed, his ears rang from time to time, sometimes sharp, sometimes illusory, sometimes seductive, sometimes arrogant, sometimes mad whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I clearly can’t understand what this is saying, Zhou Mingrui can’t help but listen and distinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His head was sore again, as intense as a steel pin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui only feels that his head is about to burst, and his thoughts are dyed with psychedelic colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that he is wrong and tries to open his eyes, but he can't complete this simple action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole person is getting tighter and can break at any time. Zhou Mingrui has inexplicably developed a self-deprecating thought:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't die, you won't die..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't bear it anymore, when the string in his mind is about to break, countless voices The whistle of the crosses of the crosses retreated, the surroundings became very quiet, and the atmosphere was quite erratic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the atmosphere, Zhou Mingrui feels that his body is also erratic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to blink again, this time it was very easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diffuse fog is reflected in his eyes, ambiguous, fuzzy, boundless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Zhou Mingrui looked around and looked down and found himself floating on the edge of a flawless fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog is like a stream of water, dotted with crimson "stars", they are very large, some are small, some are hidden in the depths, Some float on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this holographic scene, Zhou Mingrui is half confused and explores his right hand, trying to touch a deep red floating on the right side of the surface. "Star", looking for a way to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his fingers just touched the surface of the star, suddenly there was a water ripple coming out of him, causing a "deep red" burst, like a dream Fireworks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui was shocked, his right hand panicked back, and accidentally encountered another "dark red." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, this "star" is also followed by a bright future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Zhou Mingrui felt that his head was empty and his spirit was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
