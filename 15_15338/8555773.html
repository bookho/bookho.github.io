			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Klein’s question, Emlin White was shocked and looked at the other side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are richer than I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally thought that Sherlock Moriarty had at least a week to raise 2,450 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been squandering for a long time." Klein sighed and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin nodded thoughtfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do private investigators make money? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just a convenient action. If you don't have a big reward, you will have two or three hundred pounds a year," Klein said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin glanced at him and asked inadvertently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you What is actually doing? Smuggling arms and stealing the treasury of the rich? For the extraordinary people of sequence 7 and below, there are not many things that can quickly reach more than 2,000 pounds, most of which are on the verge of illegal crime. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vampire and me talk about illegal crimes? It seems that you are quite yearning for making quick money... Klein smiled and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take some dangerous tasks, if you are not afraid of death, You can try it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin closed his mouth for a long time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Come to me, I will take you to the seller."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a vampire from the heart... Klein is about to agree, suddenly feels a little Insurance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if the seller sees the money? In case he has no corresponding extraordinary materials at all, is he trying to deceive people in the past? Emlin White can trust, the seller he introduced may not be... I have to find an excuse to go to the fog to do divination, to confirm the degree of danger... Well, there is no need to be so complicated, there is a better way... ...with a lot of thoughts, Klein looked at Emlin sideways:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, go by yourself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I will give you a prepayment of 1,000 pounds. You will bring the two materials to the harvest church. After confirmation, I will pay the final payment. I think the seller should be able to accept this method. This shows that The credit of a noble blood family. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a hold, Emlin lifted his chin unconsciously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This trading method is no problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are afraid of not being credited over there ? In the Harvest Church, can you feel at ease? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, a person who is more than two meters tall and has an extremely muscular muscle standing next to him will have a sense of security." Klein smiled and pointed to Father Uttraski. "I can deal with him, and I don't care about the wealth of two or three thousand pounds." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin's face is dark and stunned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not Worried that I swallowed the £1,000 advance payment? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looks at the front:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why worry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will come back every day and it will be easy to find, and a living vampire will not stop for more than 1,000 pounds even if it is sold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin was poked at the pain, whispered angrily:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood! Understand? Blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, don't use the 'only' unit! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein chuckled and didn't talk again, waiting for the other to calm down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the way you ask for it." Finally, Emlin reached for the forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately took out the envelope that was received in the morning and handed it to the other party with a thick 1,000 pounds of cash inside:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At 8 o'clock in the evening, see here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin counted the banknotes in the number, after confirmation, Vigilantly sneaked a glimpse of Father Uttraski and lowered his voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Private Detective, you are constantly exposed to all kinds of intelligence and news, are you there? I have heard of a sacred god called 'fool'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil... Evil you... Klein almost swears in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He replied as usual:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recently many people are looking for 'fool' believers You also want to join them and ask for a reward?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "No, I am just thinking about whether to pray to this evil spirit, or evil spirits, and ask him to help me to dispel psychological cues. What you know, there are His specific names that are passed on, as long as they are transformed into He In Mies and Ancient Hermes, it is possible to get a response... What do you know about Him? How much harm does He bring to believers? Will it forcefully change the views of believers?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the goal is directed at me, I still want to say, vampire classmates, you are in a hurry to go to hospital... Klein feels very complicated and said:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The 'fool' is very mysterious. To this end, except for the news you already know, no one knows his detailed situation, such as Coverage, such as the corresponding prayer ceremony.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What makes me wonder is why, in this case, why don't you consider the sucking, the amount, the ancestor of the blood family , ancient god Lilith? As long as the ritual is correct and the sacrifice is appropriate, He should help you to relieve the psychological suggestion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin leaned back and looked straight ahead, for a few seconds without speaking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He seems to be getting deeper.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief silence, he whispers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Before the Cataclysm, the ancestors had rarely responded to the petition. Only with special matters could they get his help. This did not include the lifting of psychological cues. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the legend of Silver City, the ancient god Lilith, who represents the moon, has been regained power by the reawaken creator, or earlier in a war It’s fallen... Then, who is the occasional response to the blood clan? The original moon? Klein deliberately asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is also the 'primitive moon' that can be prayed Many rituals of the underground extraordinary have their power. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mainly refers to "Witch King" and the corresponding creatures... Klein added a sentence in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin’s lips are agitated, but they fail to make a sound, and there is a bit of indescribable fear on his face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, he The dignity says: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suspect that the 'primitive moon' is a demon or a high demon, and most of the people who pray to him will change a little bit. Become cruel, become crazy, and full of prosperous desires, and the rest, mainly bloody, with a high probability of being out of control on the spot, becoming a real monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a powerful blood race who tried to pray for danger. The result turned into a piece of meat that only knew mating and reproduction, she and cattle, sheep, horses, Rats, even plants and stones, gave birth to one strange and one strange offspring, each of which is equivalent to creating a new monster race. Fortunately, she was quickly cleared, and her offspring were the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......"The Primitive Moon" is so dangerous? I have never mentioned it in the Book of Secrets... The Karaman Witch King has been eroded by Him? Fortunately, I am imitating and adapting. The object of prayer is myself... Klein is shocked by the description of Emlin White. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him realize that the hidden existence outside the Seven Gods is indeed less trustworthy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
