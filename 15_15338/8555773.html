Klein sighed and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin nodded thoughtfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do private investigators make money? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just a convenient action. If you don't have a big reward, you will have two or three hundred pounds a year," Klein said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin glanced at him and asked inadvertently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you What is actually doing? Smuggling arms and stealing the treasury of the rich? For the extraordinary people of sequence 7 and below, there are not many things that can quickly reach more than 2,000 pounds, most of which are on the verge of illegal crime. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vampire and me talk about illegal crimes? It seems that you are quite yearning for making quick money... Klein smiled and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take some dangerous tasks, if you are not afraid of death, You can try it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin closed his mouth for a long time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Come to me, I will take you to the seller."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a vampire from the heart... Klein is about to agree, suddenly feels a little Insurance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if the seller sees the money? In case he has no corresponding extraordinary materials at all, is he trying to deceive people in the past? Emlin White can trust, the seller he introduced may not be... I have to find an excuse to go to the fog to do divination, to confirm the degree of danger... Well, there is no need to be so complicated, there is a better way... ...with a lot of thoughts, Klein looked at Emlin sideways:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, go by yourself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I will give you a prepayment of 1,000 pounds. You will bring the two materials to the harvest church. After confirmation, I will pay the final payment. I think the seller should be able to accept this method. This shows that The credit of a noble blood family. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a hold, Emlin lifted his chin unconsciously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This trading method is no problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are afraid of not being credited over there ? In the Harvest Church, can you feel at ease? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, a person who is more than two meters tall and has an extremely muscular muscle standing next to him will have a sense of security." Klein smiled and pointed to Father Uttraski. "I can deal with him, and I don't care about the wealth of two or three thousand pounds." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin's face is dark and stunned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not Worried that I swallowed the £1,000 advance payment? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looks at the front:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why worry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will come back every day and it will be easy to find, and a living vampire will not stop for more than 1,000 pounds even if it is sold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin was poked at the pain, whispered angrily:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood! Understand? Blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein chuckled and didn't talk anymore, waiting for the other to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the way you requested." Finally, Emlin reached for the forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately took out the envelope that was received in the morning and handed it to the other party with a thick 1,000 pounds of cash inside:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At 8 o'clock in the evening, see here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin counted the banknotes in the number, after confirmation, Vigilantly sneaked a glimpse of Father Uttraski and lowered his voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Private Detective, you are constantly exposed to all kinds of intelligence and news, are you there? I have heard of a sacred god called 'fool'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil... Evil you... Klein almost swears in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He replied as usual:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recently many people are looking for 'fool' believers You also want to join them and ask for a reward?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "No, I am just thinking about whether to pray to this evil spirit, or evil spirits, and ask him to help me to dispel psychological cues. What you know, there are His specific names that are passed on, as long as they are transformed into He In Mies and Ancient Hermes, it is possible to get a response... What do you know about Him? How much harm does He bring to believers? Will it forcefully change the views of believers?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the goal is directed at me, I still want to say, vampire classmates, you are in a hurry to go to hospital... Klein feels very complicated and said:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The 'fool' is very mysterious. To this end, except for the news you already know, no one knows his detailed situation, such as Coverage, such as the corresponding prayer ceremony.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What makes me wonder is why, in this case, why don't you consider the sucking, the amount, the ancestor of the blood family , ancient god Lilith? As long as the ritual is correct and the sacrifice is appropriate, He should help you to relieve the psychological suggestion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin leaned back and looked straight ahead, for a few seconds without speaking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He seems to be getting deeper.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief silence, he whispers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Before the Cataclysm, the ancestors had rarely responded to the petition. Only with special matters could they get his help. This did not include the lifting of psychological cues. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the legend of Silver City, the ancient god Lilith, who represents the moon, has been regained power by the reawaken creator, or earlier in a war It’s fallen... Then, who is the occasional response to the blood clan? The original moon? Klein deliberately asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is also the 'primitive moon' that can be prayed Many rituals of the underground extraordinary have their power. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mainly refers to "Witch King" and the corresponding creatures... Klein added a sentence in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin’s lips are agitated, but they fail to make a sound, and there is a bit of indescribable fear on his face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, he The dignity says: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suspect that the 'primitive moon' is a demon or a high demon, and most of the people who pray to him will change a little bit. Become cruel, become crazy, and full of prosperous desires, and the rest, mainly bloody, with a high probability of being out of control on the spot, becoming a real monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a powerful blood race who tried to pray for danger. The result turned into a piece of meat that only knew mating and reproduction, she and cattle, sheep, horses, Rats, even plants and stones, gave birth to one strange and one strange offspring, each of which is equivalent to creating a new monster race. Fortunately, she was quickly cleared, and her offspring were the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him realize that the hidden existence outside the Seven Gods is indeed not so trustworthy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except me... He sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Emlin bitterly laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the 'fool' brings The negative impact is not that big, and praying to Him is not something that cannot be considered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only effect is that you will pay a certain amount of compensation...Klein In order to maintain his own image, he can only pat the shoulders of Emlin and draw a triangular emblem on his chest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unclear the hidden truth It is very dangerous to have prayers. In this case, it is better to pick a favorite faith from the Seven Gods. They will not affect your daily life and will not let you discard the dolls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is really no other way..." Emlin suddenly found himself calmer than he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t stop, squeezed into the hallway and went to the Harvest Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the misty sky outside, he began to think about what to do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that his current focus is on saving money and finding materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small "Sun" is stable again, so as not to be suspected again, let him use the method of removing the mental pollution of the runaways to compensate for the promised reward... ...the deep sea Naga's hair can be entrusted to the "inverted man", the character of the human skin shadow depends on himself... Emlin White and the "eye of wisdom" Mr. Stanton, for more than a month There is no corresponding news, you have to change channels... Well, for a long time, the high-ranking strongman of the Rose School should not closely monitor the "Brave" bar. In the evening, turn around and see if you can contact Shangsha. Miss Lun and Maric... Kline quickly got an idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in order to go to the "Brave" bar, he had to go to the Eastern District and change the worker's clothing in the one-bedroom house that was rented in Black Palm Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he walked to the opposite public carriage site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the outskirts of the West, Green Grave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folth Wall, wearing a black cap, walked quietly beside Dorian Gray, the Abraham family member, to accompany him to Lawrence, Anlisa and others laid the graves and laid flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent way, her thoughts are all on the extraordinary material of the "food spiriter stomach bag". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that she has already digested the "apprentice" potion, as long as she gets the "food spiriter stomach bag", she can become a "master of tricks", but there is no corresponding The clues of the item, and the most promising help to her "sun", because of the previous things, did not dare to hold a ceremony, did not dare to invite friends to kill the "food spirit". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to improve as quickly as possible, to get rid of the full moon curse, she even prayed to Mr. Fool, asking the other person to help find the material, in the process She revealed that her new book was published, and she was about to receive the payment of the guarantee to prove that she had sufficient purchasing power - she did not worry that the actual identity was known to Mr. "fool" because she thought that "fool" must be very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a quiet, peaceful, cold environment, Fols and Dorian stopped at the tomb of Lawrence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the photo taken after death, reading the epitaph of "He is a good teacher", Dorian Gray is silent for a long time, good I sighed for a long time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s ironic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Firth was surprised and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had previously heard that Lawrence had mentioned that he was a public school teacher in Constance, Kamihain, so he used such an epitaph. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
