			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undulating sea, in the ancient dark sailboat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger Wilson is standing at the window, thinking about what to pay attention to when returning to Paso Island, and there is innocent fog and sorghum on top of it. The figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately saw the deep red light, saw the vague figure of the suspected "world", and the other side of the ear sounded the calm and quiet words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening carefully, Alger’s eyes were a little bit big, and there was a joy that was difficult to contain in his heart, and there was a strong surprise and sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers very clearly that the last time the Tarot meeting, the "World" only promised to help the "Sun" get the "Notary" potion formula within three days. Did not say "Sea singer" related things, the result of this only a few days passed, the gentleman got a few circulating sequence 5 formula, but also harvested the main material! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did he do?" Alger said silently, and his mind couldn’t help but recall the cold and hard look of German Sparrow. More and more, I feel that the other party can't see through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the benefit of being a leader? Well, I just received the news yesterday. Galman Sparo boarded the "Future" in Nasse last week. This aspect shows that "the star above" is indeed a "hidden", on the other hand, It shows that what the "world" did last week is very important. For example, if you enter the dangerous sea area in the east and get what you have, you have to seek the help of the "hidden". He has therefore been promoted to become the strongest of the sequence 5? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This explains why he got the "Sea Singer" potion formula and master material in just a few days... But what did he do? Will not kill a church's quasi-high-level? Alger couldn't help but frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly calmed his mind and shifted his focus to something else:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I got it The formula and the main material really make him very happy and excited, and sincerely feel that becoming a member of the “Tarot Club” is a turning point in his life, but accordingly, he must also pay a price! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What can I give to the ‘world?...” Alger fell into meditation and sadly found that there was no equivalent item or money on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously paced back and forth, turning round and round at the window position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, the busy "world" disappears, Klein I turned my attention to the "Grossel Travels" that was just brought into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book, bounded by yellow-brown parchment, is quietly placed on the top of the bronze long table. There is no strange place. The talent is willing to pay attention to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has a paper-and-paper pen and carefully wrote the first divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is the uniqueness of the 'audience' approach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is most worried about this because it means that this "Travel Notes" cannot be sealed. Above the fog - it is likely to bring unexpected surprises, and when you carry it, Klein may have been sucked into the book when it is, it will be very troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removing the spirit in the left wrist cuff, Klein calmed down and tried divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he opened his eyes, the citrine pendant was rotating counterclockwise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means negation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that this strange book is not the uniqueness of the 'audience' approach, then I don't have to be too scared..." Kline thought for a few seconds And try to divination, "Grosel Travels" is not the "viewer" route sequence 1 or sequence 2 corresponding items, who knows the harvest results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm... He has been indulging for a long time, writing down a new divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Klein dared to do such divination is because he knows that the sequence of the "audience" approach has long since fallen. The uniqueness and probability are in the hands of the "Twilight Hermitage". At present, the possibility of corresponding to the true God is almost negligible. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the pen, hold the paper and the book, and Klein leaned back against the back of the chair, whispering the sentence, and using meditation to enter the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray world is violently cracked, and the sky becomes extremely bleak, as if there is a gust of wind blowing around the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the dim environment, there is a light spot on the horizon, and then it is getting bigger and clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a floating continent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continent that can accommodate several normal cities! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The periphery of this continent is grayish white, and a huge piece of rock shows their outlines. Above it, there are tens of hundreds of meters apart. High magnificent stone pillars, they stand alone or hold up a grand palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strip of gray or red, or brass cast, or ice crystals condensed dragons flying on this continent, the sky above this exotic city, sometimes falling Rest to the top of a stone pillar, overlooking Wanfang, and sometimes into the tall and magnificent palace, disappeared into the sight of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, the smallest one can be equal to the "King of the North" Yurisian, and the largest one is 100 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture is flying fast, a palace that may be more than two hundred meters high begins to occupy Klein's horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its interior, the pillars stand tall and hold the dome, and the space is large enough for any dragon to move freely here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "lens" kept going, Klein quickly saw a book made of yellow-brown parchment, which was blank, floating in the air, and around The environment is incredibly small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the book, a huge shadow appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outline of this shadow has just been outlined, and the thoughts and thoughts in Kline’s head exploded in an instant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes spurted out with blood, his ears only left two black holes in his mouth, his nostrils, dyed Bright red milk is constantly pouring out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious space above the fog immediately swayed and smoothed it all. Klein quickly returned to normal, raising his hand and rubbing his head. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pain! RealTM pain!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is no worse than 'eternal yang" I didn't even see him clearly, I didn't get any knowledge...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is the 'dream dragon' Angel Weather? The information of the little 'Sun', he has fallen at the end of the Second Age. I have been separated for a few days, two or three thousand years, just peeped, and it has become so miserable, if it is not foggy and help, sure I have died on the spot... This mark is too strong?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no specific comparison, because the damage is not as good as the 'eternal yang", but one has already died One is still alive, and people have to suspect that the ancient god is stronger than the true god..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used for nearly a minute After the time slowed down from the shadow of pain, Klein regained his gaze on "Grossel Travels", tapping the edge of the mottled long table with his fingers, silently saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The author of this book is the 'dream dragon' Angel Weather? <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "a god in ancient writing, you can automatically deduce storybook ending <br /> <br /> & nbsp;? & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" What is his purpose? When the book was formed, the 'dream dragon' should not have encountered the ancient sun god, no problem. After all, the book must be spread from the 'miracle city' Levished to the 'giant Wang Ting'. The time, while Grosser was swallowed up by the book, the Giant King was obviously still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
