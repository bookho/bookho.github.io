			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor of the Sweet Lemon Bar belongs to the owner’s room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilte. Brando is holding a cigar, standing by the window, his eyes looking out of the camera without a focal length, his face is gloomy and terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a bodyguard recently, slightly bent back, said carefully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Sotos came back from the east."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let him come in." Bilt tried to adjust his look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sotos Young is his deputy, an important member of the loose organization of the Adventurers Mutual Aid Society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than a minute, wearing a linen shirt, a brown jacket, and a dark red headscarf, Sotos came in. He was in his thirties and his skin color was ancient. Copper, the eye sockets are deep, and there are dark black beards on the lips and under the arm. At first glance, they are people who often float at sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sotos did not take a formal ceremony and looked at Bilt Brando:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Head, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, something went wrong, things seem to fail." Bilt did not hide, sighed. "I don't know how to explain to the big man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sotos responded, he turned to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does there be changes in the east?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still the same, the pirates chased every ship that could be looted Even the targets of each other, the Navy can only hold the colonies, barely maintain the smooth flow of the route, protect the relatively important ships, the sea battle often broke out, each has a victory." Sotos shrugged his shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The east of the Sea of ​​Sonia is really a chaotic paradise for pirates..." Bilt sighed and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sotos thought about it and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On those islands in the east, There have been some recent news, which is said to have been circulated from the black death number at the earliest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Sickness in the disease'? What news?" Billt played Asked the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sotos is somewhat dignified and somewhat excited to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encountered assassination, the injury is not light, and the hands-on person is the adventurer German Sparrow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German Sparo?" Bill Specially come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it is him! He is really a strong pirate general! Even if it is a sneak attack, it is also on the black death, there are many well-known around Pirates, but he still hit the 'disease lieutenant' and fled smoothly, and then hunted the 'smartwriter' Misor." Sotos gave a positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilter took two steps and sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is big news.< Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adventurous home pirate generals are very rare, and it is only one such person to be able to reinvent the other side of the pirate generals. This kind of action, except Need to have absolute confidence in their own strength, but also must be crazy enough, only the madman will directly sneak into the flagship of the pirate general, trying to assassinate, instead of looking for another place! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, his face changed slightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw one last night." An adventurer who claims to be Gilman Sparo. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really, or fake?" Sotos’s eyes narrowed and hesitated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Unsure, I have not seen the real German Sparrow, and his Photos and portraits. Bilt shook his head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You can collect newspapers from the Rothde Islands and confirm that after so many days, passengers should bring the corresponding “Newspaper”, “Sonia Morning Post”, um, government, police, church, charity organizations. Subscribe to the important newspapers of the Rothschild Islands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rothde Islands are the largest and most important colony of the Kingdom of Lun in the Central Sonia Sea, and the influence radiates around the circle. The island of Olav, which has only three days of voyages, is undoubtedly in this rank. Official agencies or church organizations will subscribe to newspapers and magazines there, and non-essential news can be read in three to four days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Bill nodded and asked in depth, "Is there any specific details about the fact that "German Sparo assassinates the disease"? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sotos recalled the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German Spalo Can become anyone, just like the previous 'Hurricane Lieutenant' Qilingus.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is with this ability that he sneaked into it. Black death, find the opportunity to assassinate. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Become a person..." Bilt’s eyes are bright.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No No, it’s a guy who is crazy enough to dare to sneak into the Black Death to assassinate the “sickness of the disease”. It’s instinctively afraid, just want to stay away... Bilt’s eyes are bleak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still don't know if it's true...He shook his head subconsciously.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know when the "Night of the Night" and "Mechanical Heart" will take action to deal with the anomalies of Williams Street, hoping that they will be able to move as soon as possible... Klein leaves the fog and returns The real world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly thinking, he pulled out a piece of stationery and laid it on a tan desk.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Dark red water-absorbing pen rustling, Klein first cared about Mr. Azick's recent situation, and then mentioned that he was looking for magical items that could steal other people's extraordinary abilities. There is a case of being parasitized by an outsider.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he looks like a smooth question about whether there is a way to bypass the parasitic outsider to remind the host.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this head, he said that he knew from others about the "bugs of time" related to the high level of the "stealers" and made it clear that this kind of thing can As a material for important ceremonies and advanced spells, I don’t know what to do.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call...Klein put down the pen, folded the letter paper, took Bronze whistle, put it to your lips, and blew it hard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white bones poured out like a huge messenger, but this time, the messenger does not Then drilled downstairs, but as many times as before, through the ceiling, looking down at the summoner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein knows this is not because of the messenger Become less polite, but because he lives now on the first floor of the hotel...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrist Flick, throw a dart-like throw stationery, and let it fall nicely into the palm of the huge bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame in the eye socket of the messenger bounced twice, seemingly staring at Klein, but nothing happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It collapsed into a white bone waterfall, and one root penetrated the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all this, Klein did not start a thousand paper cranes, erased what he had written before, and asked the "Silver Snake" Will. Saitin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because he found a bad thing, the thousand paper cranes are not magical items or extraordinary weapons, just a common paper folding After being rubbed repeatedly by the eraser, there are signs of fragility. If you come back a few times, you may break it directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After waiting for a very important thing to contact, consider it. For example, Mr. Azke is not sure how to bypass the possessive grandfather to remind Leonard. ..." Klein shook his head silently and quickly packed up the items on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today, continue to be a traveler, relax, and start looking for real opportunities tomorrow!" Klein converged his thoughts, put on his coat, took off his hat, and walked out of the hotel room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to the sunset outside the port of Olavi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea stems from a best-selling novel whose author is Leon, Marshall, born in Olavy, who settled in Bakerland after he was 20 years old. In the book, Mr. Mr. introduced the sunset of the port of San Draco with emotion, thinking that this is the most beautiful scenery he has seen so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the carriage out of the city and walked to the foot of the San Draco Mountains. It took only one hour to climb the low mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, the sun gradually falls, and the blue ocean on the left side of the mountain is dyed like a fire, leaving the green forest and the vast fields on the right. It was a golden one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All colors bloom at the end of the last bright, then gradually dim until dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance to the ship, the carriage entered the city, and the busy people returned home along the road next to the orchard in the wheat field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the darkness began to envelope this land, there was a little warmth in the city outside, and they were like gems on black velvet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really beautiful... Klein appreciates for a moment until the lights that represent the family are in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned around silently, along the mountain road, surrounded by black-stained trees, returned to the bottom, and then walked a distance in the port city The edge hired a carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage is moving smoothly, and an elegant black-and-black streetlight pole is quietly retreating in the dim light, and goes away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Klein returned to the hotel, took out the keys and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, the beds, desks, and chairs all lie quietly in the darkness of the darkness, silently reflecting the blushing moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed the door very small, walked to the window, standing in the shadow caused by the curtain, and had not moved for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside lights are clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein unscrewed the tap and took the cold tap water to his face, and the whole person was awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already figured out where to start looking for real opportunities:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still is always possible The hospital of the deceased! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Before Klein just went to those places and simply turned around and wandered for a while, it was really difficult to find the right object. This time, he decided to make a paragraph. Volunteers of time, staying in the hospital for a long time, caring for the dying people who have no family members at the moment, only in this way, can wait for the desired goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With breakfast, Klein came to No. 10 Black Forest Street and entered the Olav Medical Care Foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a charity organization with the background of the Goddess of the Night, one of which is responsible for providing trained volunteers to hospitals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein came to the registry and saw the female staff reading the newspaper, so he tapped the surface of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?" the lady asked as she put down the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to volunteer," Klein said concisely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Name." The lady looked up and looked across. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
