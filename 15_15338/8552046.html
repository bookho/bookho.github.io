			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the bedroom, Klein was very skilled in taking out a candle mixed with sandalwood and placing it on the unresolved spiritual wall. In the middle of the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, in accordance with the process, he used the spiritual light to ignite the candle, sprinkled with the essential oils, pure dew and herbal powders that symbolize good luck and mystery, and saw the swaying flames repeat. Both faint and bright, smelling a quiet and relaxing scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stepped back two steps, looking at the candles on the table, shouting out in the giant language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly paused, he changed the Hermes language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I summon in my name:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fool who does not belong to this age, the mysterious ruler above the fog, the yellow black who is in charge of good luck Wang.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the moments, the swaying dim candlelight and the quiet and leisurely scent are intertwined into an illusory vortex, madly absorbing the spiritual vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein mourned the mantra, the vortex stabilized into a gray circle of palm-sized size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After examining a few eyes, without any doubt, Klein stepped back four steps and returned to the fog, not surprisingly seeing his own high The back chair swings around the circle of light, and the quirky symbols made up of some "innocent eyes" and some "twisted lines" are very different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a breath, stabilized his mind with meditation, and reached out to touch the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, he heard the summoning mantra he had just mourned, and saw the rushing spirituality and the ray-like light pattern stretched out an illusory door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This door is completely shaped and covered with mysterious patterns compared to the previous one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These patterns are connected in a central position to the quirky symbol behind the high chair of the "fool", with some "innocent eyes" and parts " The weird symbol of the twisted line! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at this illusory door that is swaying, Klein is concentrating on the spirit and giving a strong push. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uninterrupted, never change the gray mist and the magnificent ancient palace seems to have been put into the stone lake, creating a circle and a circle Hey, rushing in the direction of the "Summoning Gate." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy friction sounded loudly, and the illusory, weird door slammed a gap, through which it was faintly visible to the depths of the darkness to the extreme. In the world, there are countless transparent shadows that are difficult to describe the form, and there are still different colors and bright brilliance with endless knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Klein only felt the unimaginable and unmatchable suction in the door, and the whole person could not help but cast it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going! Do not give room for consideration? He just emerged with a horrified thought, and the figure penetrated the gap and disappeared into the quiet behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extreme dizziness of the "head" and the snoring of the madness gradually subsided, and Klein finally recovered his self-awareness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a young man in an old shirt, black-haired brown, and ordinary facial features. The other side was medium-sized and thin, but it seemed to contain a lot of strength. With a clear book, it is not gloomy at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Is this not my own? Klein is no stranger to such a scene, and he encounters similar things when he looks at his clothes in the mirror every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded invisibly, looked around invisibly, saw his bed with white sheets, and saw a half-height silk hung The top hat, the tuxedo suit and the coat rack of the black thin trench coat saw the shelves with many books, saw the desk with only one candle left, and saw the candlelight emitting gray and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, did I really "call" myself? It is similar to the effect of the soul from the body... but it seems a bit different... Klein looked at the flesh that belongs to him in front of him, and looked at the eyes of the "he" who was in a state of daze, and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he finally determined one thing, that is, only the soul that is above the fog, that is, the spiritual body in the occult, external performance For the star spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder I can see the surface of the astral body of "justice", "downside down" and "sun" directly above the fog to determine if they belong Extraordinary, and roughly judge their sequence... Well, my body seems to have been protected, from the protection of ritual power, can stand so steady, without losing balance, stumble on the ground... Miss "Justice" they It should be almost the same... Klein slowly adapted to the current situation and began to examine the respective states of the body and soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He regained his gaze and tried to drive his own spirit that blended with some mysterious space power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly cold winds are blowing up, squatting in the bedroom, Klein delighted in the taste of the flight, round and round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the same city, I can also play a 'messenger'... I don't know if I can carry real things..." He controlled his emotions and stopped , floating in the air, testing other abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed the notebook on the shelf, the palm of his hand was worn, and he wore it back, nowhere to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a little sticky, it’s different from the air... I’m more powerful, or I can shake the mysterious space above the fog. Power, maybe it can be done..." Klein tried again on a separate piece of paper, but still couldn't grasp it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a dozen seconds, he flew to the coat rack, and the transparent and fuzzy hand was plunged into the black trench coat pocket, and the touch to the reimbursement was successfully completed. "Sleep Charm" and "An Soul Charm". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an item that is mixed with his own spirituality. In the mysterious category, there is a certain difference from ordinary reality. So, Klein wants to try it. Carry them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His palms pass again, but obviously feel the existence of the spell, feel the spiritual blend, but his "strength" is not big enough to The spell is picked up. Of course, you can also change the saying that the spirituality of the spell is not strong enough to resonate strongly with his current state of existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The spirit is not strong enough..." Klein thoughtfully turned to another pocket, which contained "the power to steal the blood of the gods and to mix themselves with spirituality." Yang Yan spell." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of warmth spread quickly throughout his body, making his form more stable and his mind clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin piece of gold was picked up by him and he took out his pocket, and in the newly added mirror in the room, the spell was floating out. Just like the descriptions in many ghost stories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be able to carry the Yangyan spell, you can also use the spiritual voice directly... Well, I have a certain strength in this state..." Kline flies The mirror, parked in front, saw only a thin piece of gold in it, but in addition to it, it was the furniture that was facing and the dim caused by the closing of the curtains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering for a few seconds, he put the "Yangyan Charm" on the bed, and he returned to the mirror before trying to get in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the black, Klein’s perspective changed suddenly. He saw all the pictures in the mirror and saw a fuzzy sketch in the dark environment. Things, which made him feel like he was hiding in a hidden corner and peering into the small half of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can really enter the mirror, but this is just an ordinary item, not leading to a mysterious and strange world... Klein nodded slightly, rushing forward, back again Into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of the "Yangyan Charm" brought him great confidence, and then tried to grab another item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a copper whistle from Azick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
