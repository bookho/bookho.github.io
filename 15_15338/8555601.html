The sequence 7 of the "Reader" route is called "Shouzhi" or "Detective" It is a "professional" with partial knowledge and reasoning ability. At most, it comes with good fighting and equipment use ability. It is not very powerful, but when it comes to sequence 6, it seems that there is a qualitative change, especially in the field of extraordinary combat. So... It seems that every extraordinary route has such a node below the high sequence, but it is not fixed in the sequence. For example, the "Divination" route is the sequence 7 "Magic"... Klein drank Hot coffee, not much to inquire about the secrets of others, and smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Stanton, you seem to be relaxed, not nervous and worried. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eisinger did not answer directly, put down the knife and fork, and took out the pipe:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't you mind?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I am more concerned, but Beckland's pollution and fog It’s already so serious, it’s not going to suck a few more second-hand smoke... Klein shook his head and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Does this help you think?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More accurately, it’s a habit. I am used to it after breakfast every day." Essinger got the pipe and took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the smoke spit out, he sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fear, nervous and worried Can't help us face threats. If so, why not be a little more relaxed? The brain will be more active, my assistant is too easy to worry, and this fatal disaster is encountered, hehe..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger looked at Kaslana and continued: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And our opponent is the 'desire apostle', Too strong emotions must be banned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The most important thing is that we don't have any other way to lock the 'desire apostle'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Kaslana will be the last piece Bacon put down and asked seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger took a pipe and laughed at himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Discussing similar topics At that time, I still prefer the easy chair.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'devil' are not good at divination and foresight except for the dangerous premonition, so the 'desire apostle' wants to Find out what the main revenge targets are, and will inevitably take the initiative to investigate the situation and collect news. Otherwise, how can he know that a group of private detectives have made outstanding contributions in the serial killings, how can they accurately lock you and me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this process, he will definitely deal with many people, even if he does disguise, he will leave some traces, and then combine the 'mechanical heart' The fuzzy image given there will form a clue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Similarly, he wants to attack me, have to figure out where I live, in and out, and work and rest. What is the law? Is there a strong official extraordinary person to protect me? This requires a short period of observation and corresponding exploration. It also has to interact with other people and fixed places. Oh, once there is interaction, There are clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The motto I like very much is that if you walk by, you will leave traces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I know this, what Russell said... Klein smiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he is a little embarrassed, because this is the second time he has heard this in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time, he was still in Tingen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caslana with a slight sagging muscle on his cheeks sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s a big detective, I didn’t think of these things, and my observation and thinking ability made me admire.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone has their own field of expertise, pure fighting, I will be defeated again and again by you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock should have thought of what I just said. Those things, he also has outstanding observation and reasoning skills, is a good detective. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when you talked about it, I was a bit embarrassed... Klein squeezed a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you are a real big detective, and I am still far apart. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a modest young man. Essinger said with a sigh of relief.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Next, we will start from these aspects, you must use your own resources and information channels. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the opening of the Tarot, I have a third of the resources and channels in Beckland from your old family... Klein laughs and responds道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Eye of Wisdom" is the only extraordinary gathering, he can only find Maric and Miss Sharon, vampires Emlin White and Ute Father Ralsky.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a "mechanical heart" to protect me secretly, Miss Sharon and Maric have to rule out directly... Emmlin that vampire can To see you, he is now half a believer of the Mother Earth, sheltered by the Utravsky bishop, and will not encounter the official removal of the official extraordinary... Klein immediately thought of the direction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caslana is silent for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein put the remaining cream on the last toast, chewed it without urgency, and then asked:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Stanton, you seem to have mentioned the opening of a seal. Can it help us deal with the 'desire apostle'? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the last time the demon dog was found to be surrounded, its role is crucial." Essinger responded calmly. "It's codenamed ‘1-42’. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1-42"? "1" seal, highly dangerous, limited use, even Beckland Parish, can only save one or two Piece... Klein’s mind flashed the corresponding description in an instant, and asked with interest: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of item is it? What are the capabilities and negative impacts? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the secret of the Church of the Night God, I am I don't know, I only know that it was not in Beckland, because the serial killing was sent urgently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that it is a silver full-body armor with a small piece of dry, dark red blood that once directly led to the destruction of a small town and died of it. More than 100,000 people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Curse armor?" Klein asked in a named way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger spit out his breath and shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe not a curse, Some call it 'crazy armor', 'blood-stained armor', and we have guessed inside the church that the blood on its surface may come from the gods of an older age.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "When it was discovered, it did not have any anomalies, but it was treated as a simple antique, sold and collected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But over time, those who have been in contact with it have died, the death is extremely horrible, almost detached, and then, with it as the center Death spreads out and no longer needs to be touched. A small town is destroyed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This happened in the early fifth period, and the subsequent processing was carried out by the night keeper. . ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaslana asked with some worries: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does it bring us danger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The Goddess of the Night God must have found the right seal, but for us, if you can not contact, try not to touch." Essinger is half relieved and reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast, Klein entered the living room where he had fought before, and Kaslana went to the bathroom first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at her back, Klein said thoughtfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She seems Is the extraordinary person of the 'arbitrator' approach?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your observation is really good." Essinger sat in the easy chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein went to the single sofa and whispered in confusion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This route It was strictly controlled by the royal family, the military and the ancient aristocrats. There were few recipes and materials in the outside world. Does Kaslana have this background?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Singer smiled and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Obviously.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But to this extent, she Did not take the initiative to mention the corresponding things, it shows that there are some reasons for inconvenience. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks at his eyes and looks at Klein. The implication is that you are not the same?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Klein laughed twice and sat down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Kaslana came to the living room and continued to discuss with Klein and Essinger. "Desire of the Apostles".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just talking and talking, her look suddenly became stunned and sighed: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the most dangerous incident I have ever been involved in. I don't know if I can survive in the end. If I am killed by the 'Desire Apostle', I hope my tombstone There can be such a sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She has a great mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cas Lanna's voice is getting lower, and the feeling of being stiff and not getting along is a bit more gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eisinger has the same sympathy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also the face I have faced The most dangerous enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I die, And you are still alive, are you willing to help me send the relics to Rumburg and send them to the 'Knowledge Temple'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Do not frantically set Flag! Kline had a half-mouth and didn't know how to stop the two detectives in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, but I hope there will never be this day." He tried to resolve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger looked at him and asked curiously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock What about you? If you are killed by the 'Desire Apostle', what do you want to do for others to help you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Resurrection me! Klein sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope to be buried in a beautiful cemetery, the body is best intact, with holy water and flowers..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core meaning of his passage is:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not cremate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three were silent for a while, until the doorbell of the jingle was heard outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
