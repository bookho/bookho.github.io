			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of "inexplicable familiarity", other extraordinary people of sequence 9 may try to recall, perhaps ignore the forgetting, but the divination is different, Klein directly ends Ceremony, remove the spiritual wall, find the paper, and write the divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The source of familiarity."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he sat down at the bed of the bedroom, holding the paper while meditating on the statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven times, his eyes turned deep and he used meditation to enter the sleep and "talk" to his own spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blurry and distorted world, Klein saw a carriage and saw a young lady in a gray dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is black and soft, her face is round, her temperament is gentle and sweet, and her body is shaking abnormally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture flickered, and Klein saw the young and beautiful girl again. She was in the underground trading market and talked rudely with people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreams faded quickly, and Klein woke up and understood why he was familiar with the image presented in the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen each other in reality! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first time I met was at Narcissus Street, which belongs to the neighborhood of Iron Cross Street, and the captain of the night they were chasing the 'Teacher' Tries down the street. ... There seems to be a certain connection between the two..." Klein pondered for a few tens of seconds, and arranged a ceremony to pray for the goddess to portray the image of the enemy in the impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng and others have been waiting quietly, without any arbitrarily interpreting, until this time, they came together to examine the portrait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen her?" Dunn asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's slightly dagger, the language succinctly answers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you hunt 'teachers On the night of that, I met her at the public carriage site of Narcissus Street, which is near the Iron Cross Street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The big chance is that she just Enemy, accomplices of the instigators." Dunn seemed to nod in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Leonard suddenly snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not feel familiar with the portrait? She is very similar to 'Teacher' Tris!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stunned and immediately turned his attention to paper and re-examined the young lady’s portrait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it’s really similar, the face is round, the eyes are narrow, the temperament is gentle...” The more he looks, the more Leonard’s words make sense, just "The instigator" Tries's five senses are still ordinary, but the young lady is enough to be beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein raised his head and looked at Leonard and found that the other person had made a suggestion to raise his eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean? He was amazed and confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn Smith thinks and guesses:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe she is a 'teacher' Sisters, also joined the Gnosis, or the Witch sect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Klein has no tacit understanding with himself, Leonard secretly sighs, a serious statement: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a bold idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What thoughts?" Dunn asked. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard stated very directly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suspect this person is the 'teacher 'Tris!'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunn frowned slightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What you mean is that 'teacher' Tries is actually a woman, or that the one just pretending to be a woman Man, no, from the perspective of dreams, I confirm that she is a woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has seen too many brain holes and all kinds of incredible plots, After looking at the eye portrait again, there was another guess: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the 'teacher' Tris become a woman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, a lot of details can be explained. For example, why does the clue of Tries suddenly break, even if it is divination, there is no trace, because the target object has already happened. Change! The only question is, how can he become a woman, it seems to be quite easy... It’s not bad to become a “women’s big man” afterwards. No, hold down the conscience, it’s quite good... Klein’s thoughts Thinking divergently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard is pleased to say: "Yes, this is my idea, which perfectly explains the 'teacher' Tris suddenly disappeared, It is also in line with the characteristics of women in the upper layers of the witch sect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Dunn and Frye could not speak for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they have seen a lot of monsters and seen a lot of magical things, similar changes are still encountered for the first time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean, many women at the top of the witch sect have been men?" Dunn asked, not waiting for an answer, and said to himself. "There is a certain possibility...this may be them, no, they are characteristic of the sequence of potions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein heard the lower body chilling and felt the witch The sequence of potions is simply too pit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that the 'Divination' sequence does not have this pothole potion... No, certainly not, one is the way of the witch, I know the wrong name... ...but, I don't know what the sequence 1 of the 'Divination' is..." He prayed to the goddess subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can the potion do this?" Frye asked a little unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if the low- and medium-sequence potions can It’s a miraculous change, after all, it’s from the Creator.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Dunn looked sideways at Klein: “You try to divinate the target. The current position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein came to the pile of messy skirts and felt very complicated to take one. On the carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed his cane on it, thinking back to the character's appearance and corresponding information, while silently reading the divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tries, no, the fall of Terry." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fall of Terrys."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seven times, Klein’s eyes turned from brown to black, and there was a sudden swirl around the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His left hand was off the stick and the silvery black cane was shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the swaying, the cane failed to fall down and settled in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is interference..." Klein said in a deep voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no error in the direction of the interference itself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady’s high probability is just “teacher” Tries, no, Terry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this situation, Dunn’s invisible location:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s the last epoch to be active The witch sect on the mainland stage..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking around, Dunn sighed: "We can trace from other places, such as the source of these dresses, such as the owner of the house, and let the police department send personnel to check the steam train station and the dock."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These really find clues, but as a result, Terry has plenty of time to stay away from Tingen... well, go home and get a try again. Try... Klein is full of alert to the guy who is not in a hurry to commit a mass killing tragedy. He wants to find it immediately and execute it on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leonard, you go to the police department, call people to deal with the follow-up, Klein, you can go home and rest..." said here, Dunn He rubbed his temples and paused for a few seconds. Half of the test was half-guided to look at Klein. "If you let me command, what would you do with the things just now? Suppose your players have me, Leonard and Frye. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein frowned and thought for a dozen seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will First use the divination method to confirm whether the ritual will take effect in a short time. If the answer is no, monitor it first, don't close it, then send someone to inform the police department, notify the nearby garrison, and mobilize at least five artillery pieces to come over. The house was covered by a bombing, and the altar was directly flattened, and the place where Terry was hiding was flattened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is either hiding inside and being bombed Die, or sneak away from artillery, and it’s easy to expose the figure. In advance, I will let the captain keep you alone. Position ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; he is getting more and more excited, and feel that this approach is simple and effective, altogether rude, very safe, very safe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn, Leonard, and Frye heard the sluggishness, and for a long time no one spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amount, captain, is this method not good?" Excited Klein saw the reaction of the other party, and suddenly he was a little drumming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den is silent for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, this method is good, just need Adding a premise, that is, confirming that the violent destruction of the altar will cause more serious consequences... Well, we have been a night lover for a long time. Many times we have become accustomed to relying on ourselves, relying on extraordinary abilities, relying on the corresponding firearms, and accustomed to Let ordinary people get in touch with extraordinary events..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I have always been a loyal supporter of firepower coverage... Klein silently added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deep night, Klein and Leonard are almost gone Only 500 meters to see the public carriage site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, they returned to Iron Cross Street, one to the nearby police station and one to Daffodil Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving outside the house, Klein sorted out the clothes and confirmed that there was nothing strange to pick up the keys and open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the living room, Melissa and Benson are still bright with the gas light, one doing homework, one reading book, quiet and warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson ran around in the daytime, tired, not able to go home, can still persist in learning, really a persevering person... I can’t. I just want to lie down now... Klein glanced at his brother, raising his hand with a smile and saying hello silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I now understand that a generous salary is also a price. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everything in this world has a price. If you have something to gain, you have to pay." Klein said while placing his cane on the shelf next to the door. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This sentence seems to have been said by Russell the Great?" Melissa stopped the pen and raised her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tingen City Technical College is different from the university and public school. Every summer, only two weeks in late July and early August, when the hottest stage passes, the class will resume immediately. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? I don't know..." Klein replied slightly stiffly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
