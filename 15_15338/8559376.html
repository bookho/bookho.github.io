			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was amazed, and the instinct was sideways, leaving his back to Leo Master, who was trembling in the storage room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not sure that this "prisoner" wearing a linen robe has no problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, wearing a black full body armor, the Cavaliers with the same face of Leo Mast, the eyes of the knight are deep red, and the hands lifted the sleek and wide Straight sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped forward and made a forward move, so fast that Klein’s eyes could hardly be captured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same side of his side, Klein subconsciously raised the "Poseidon Scepter", letting the top blue gems shine at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real hurricane rises out of the air, and surrounds Klein layer by layer, protecting him in the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stab! The black streamer came, and the wind blew layer by layer, spurting toward the surroundings, and the whole hall was swaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the black sword, the hurricane made an explosion-like sound, turned into a shock wave, drowned the area, and picked up all the debris. In mid-air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fierce collision clearly shakes the dream, and Kline’s spirit is violent, rolling involuntarily for two laps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell from his bed on the bed to the deck and slammed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Black Saint" is really strong...or, I have not really used the "Poseidon Scepter" in the real world, so in the dream Can't restore all of its power... and so on! This is still the night! Klein suddenly noticed a problem: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was no noon sun shining in the window position! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His awakening stems from a fierce confrontation in a dream, not a natural change! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, he must immediately fall asleep immediately, otherwise it is very likely that he will disappear in this dark night, no one can find it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking in the flash, Klein held his right hand, bouncing up, flew to his bed, and steadily lay on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he looked at countless superimposed light balls and quickly entered the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, Klein’s eyes swept through the window, faintly seeing the night outside was deep and cold, quiet and peaceful, without any sinister taste. At the same time, he blurs the fog that hangs over the sea at a distance, and in the fog, there is a steep-edged church with a very old architectural style. It was black, there was no bell tower, and there was a dark crow on the top that was circling, as if to pay homage, what to mourn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This church is surrounded by a lot of buildings, there are ordinary two-story houses, simple wooden houses, breadboards with hanging signs, waterwheels For the power of the gray mill... A road passer in the streets and lanes, the figure is shadowy, it is difficult to know the specific. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirage? The source of danger at night? All the missing people are out of mind, went there? Klein woke up in his dreams, and his subconscious mind flashed through the accumulated questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he forcibly converged his thoughts and took out the "Poseidon Scepter" from the "Special Area of ​​the Spiritual World"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers fighting with the "Black Saint" before he left the dream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are no longer the tall knights wearing black full-length armor, nor the Leo Master, a linen robes, but a row of floor-to-ceiling windows facing the setting sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window is very clean, and under the sunlight of the outside, it reveals indescribable purity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the window, there is a long wooden table and a brown chair, and a little further away there is a row of bookshelves, topped Filled with a variety of books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Library? Big library? Every time I enter this dream world, I will randomly go to different places within a certain range. Klein watched carefully and carefully for a while, confirming that it was safe for the time being. There was no such thing as a "black sage" and no strange evil creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds the "Poseidon Scepter" and walks to the floor-to-ceiling window to look at the outside environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that caught his eye was the magnificent architectural complex covering the opposite mountain. The huge palace, the majestic minaret, and the towering walls were all solidified in the evening. There is visual shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it wasn’t the first time to see it, Klein still held his breath and quietly enjoyed the miraculous scenery for a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately moved his gaze and looked at the cliff, saw the high wall of the black monastery, saw the yellow trees beside the boulder, but could not be blocked because of Confirm that "Star above will" Jia Delia is still in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, within a certain range, did not leave this area... I am deep into the black monastery? Klein retracted his thoughts thoughtfully and walked step by step to the bookshelves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no time to think about what the "Black Saint" and Leo Masters in the previous dreams are, because they must first confirm the current situation. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After approaching the bookshelf, Klein found that the books placed above had their own names, not the kind of ambiguity in normal dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Spirit of Life" "The Book of the Curse" "The Flower of the Heart" "The Inner and Outer Universe and the Real Starry Sky"... This is a book in the field of occult... ... Klein cautiously reached out and took out the book "The Book of Charms." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly looked through and found that most of the content in the book was mastered, but a small part of it was of a type he had never touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can confirm that this is not my dream embodiment... "The hidden person"? What knowledge she was chased and instilled in the library of the Black Monastery? Klein did not have the desire to explore, holding this "Book of Charms" back to the floor-to-ceiling window, looking for a position to sit down, and the light of the evening, carefully read it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dream, you can even learn! He licked his paper and pen and wrote and painted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was addicted to this time, the light suddenly turned bright, and White ruled his vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein naturally blinks, and the sun shining through it is warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only read a few pages, I am going to take a quick look at it, and then I think back with the method of 'dream divination'..." Klein was upset and felt himself I missed a great opportunity to learn because he was not sure if he would be random to the black monastery library next time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked his hair, put on his hat, went down to the deck, and observed the environment before reminiscent of the previous dream:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The prisoner’s high probability is also in the black monastery, um, probably the bottom part, in other words, the 'Black sage' and Leo Master are somewhere near the ruins or Inside the ruins.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder 'Silver Snake' Will. Ann Setin let me not try to explore, those places are really full of danger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can 'The Holy of the Black' and Leo Master be exactly the same? This dream is a bit strange, and the full-length mirror is also amazing. Very sinister, even copied a Galman Sparo out..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
