			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the "fool" problem, Audrey quietly raised his ears, entered the "audience" state, and waited for the "sun" to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been very curious about where Silver City is, what special place, but embarrassed to ask, after all, this involves the privacy of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Mr. Fool’s personal inquiry, let her just like to read the excellent detective novels for a long time, finally have the opportunity to buy the next book! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the "Sun" did not disappoint her. They did not believe in the seven orthodox gods of the mainstream, nor the death gods of the South, nor even The hangman told her the secret existence and evil spirits, such as the original witch, the hidden sage, the dark side of the universe, the bound god, the true creator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of Silver is really special! They even directly believe in the "creator" itself! Is this the original worship described by Mr. Well, the omniscient description is a bit strange... Audrey subconsciously looked at the "downside down" and found that the other party really nodded slightly. <br /><br />############ Abandoned you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandon? The Creator abandoned the city of silver? “After hanging down” Alger was shocked and instantly thought of a proper noun:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Abandoned Land!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the internal information of the Lord of the Storm, in the secret that Alger, the bishop’s “captain” can access, the “land of God” always has a name, no specific Description, but clearly pointed to the end of the Sunia Sea. As far as he knows, even the cardinals at the core of the church do not know what the “land of God” stands for, only the leader of the church, the Lord of the Storm. "The activist" only understands some situations, and seems to secretly preside over the hidden actions of finding "the land of God." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger once made a bold guess that the real creator of the Aurora would be equated with the "sanctuary" and "the land of God", but unfortunately Yes, the "fool" did not give him a reply, so that he could not confirm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, he is shocked and stunned to discover that Tarot will be a member of the "Sun", and he is likely to be born in the "land of God"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. "The Fool" always knows where "the land of God is abandoned" and can pull members from there? This is the secret place that the Lord of the Storm wants to find but can't always find! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&#;&#;&#;&#;&#;&#;&#;&#;&#;&#&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& In the fog, it seems that nothing has been said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey has nothing to do with this matter, the only time she heard that "the land of God abandoned" is still from the problem of "downside down people". But I didn't put this in my heart, and I couldn't think of anything from the words of Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silver City has the legend of being abandoned by the Creator... Hey, Mr. "Floating Man" has a lot of mood swings... What is he wondering and afraid? Audrey nodded doubtfully, remembering the details of this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we all believe that we will eventually regain the Lord’s care, perhaps the day when the sun rises again." Dairik Berg’s tone is not Too firm to answer, "We were once ruled by the giant Wang Ting, and the king of the army was the believer. Later, we got the redemption of the Lord, and we will not turn our back on the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rule by the giant Wang Ting...It’s really old...but it doesn’t seem to correspond...There was a speculation that “the hanging man” Algerton thought of the Second Age in the hidden chapter of The Book of the Storm. description of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Age is also known as the "Dark Age" of mankind. At that time, the protagonists of the sky, the ocean and the earth were dragons, giants, elves, and heterogeneous species. , demons, immortals, devils, and dead spirits, but in the end, the Lord of the Storm, the eternal sun, the god of knowledge and wisdom led the human race, defeated these extraordinary creatures one by one, and ushered in the initial "Glorious Age" of the Third Age. ", after that is the so-called Cataclysm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant King Olmir... Klein repeats the name silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many myths and legends, this is a powerful existence comparable to the gods, even today, there are still some places to worship him, such as Inti The most famous and expensive wine in the Republic of the Republic is named "Ormir" - it is said that the giant king loves bloody wines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the complete sequence mastered by the "God of War" church, that is, the "warrior" sequence, once belonged to the giant Wang Ting, can you think that Ormill is an ancient god of war? Klein made a guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately nodded his head and did not go deep into this matter, but turned to a low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Are you still offering a sacrifice to the omnipotent God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, still, but from the day of the abandonment, we will I have never received a response." "The Sun" Dairik's tone implies an unspeakable pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned back more leisurely, half closed his eyes and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Detailed description The process of your sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool" wants to figure out the truth about the abandoned city of Silver City? Or does He want to determine if the Creator still "exists"? "Inverted people" Alger suddenly felt that "current" passed his body, and the whole person shook it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not only afraid, but also excited because he thinks he is in contact with the secrets of the gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes him feel that his level has been sublimated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am trying to pursue authority and pursue strength, isn’t it just to get this feeling? Alger leaned back slightly, his chin lifted slightly, and he thought intoxicatedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of Mr. "Down Hanging Man" is not normal... "Justice" Audrey looked at the opposite side with pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally understands that the communication between Mr. "fool" and "the sun" may hide some amazing secrets, so that "upside down people" appear A situation of ecstasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the entrustment of Qi Lingus is over, I will pay for it, and I will exchange the "hidden man" from what he realized today... I don't know Is he willing to... Audrey has some expectations and is worried about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik did not feel anything wrong, and honestly replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We have built a magnificent altar, engraved with the symbol of the Lord. Whenever the 'black grass' is harvested, we will hold a sacrifice ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"We will catch the monsters in the depths of the dark as sacrifices, and wait until we remember the Lord's name and the corresponding prayers. After jumping to please his dance, kill the monsters and let them be spiritual or Blood stains the entire altar, if you can't catch the monster, then replace it with the 'sinner' at the bottom of the silver city prison."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The harvested first bush of black grass is made into food and presented to the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Finally, in our unison songs, the ceremony is over. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I am going to try to "sacrifice" to myself, so time is not picking, the altar is simple... The most important part is These monsters spiritual or blood contains extraordinary powers to open the tunnel, complete sacrifice, of course, if you are able to get a response? It’s a luxury... Klein analyzes every step of the Silver City Sacrificial Ceremony with his own occult knowledge, and ends up: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The corresponding prayer statement is What? What language do you use to mourn?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derico also expects to get a hint of getting rid of the curse from Mr. "The Fool" and recall carefully: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We use the giant language, which is our lingua franca."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The prayer mantra is: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your faithful believers pray for your gaze;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pray that you will accept their dedication;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for you to open the door to the kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened silently, deliberately letting the fog of his body slowly linger, and thoughtfully nodded and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
