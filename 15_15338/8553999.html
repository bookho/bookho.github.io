			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Des. Shaw? Mr. Hibbert Hall? Who is this with whom, I don’t know at all... Klein pretends that he has no doubts, half jokingly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope they can bring Beckland Blue sky and sunshine.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, although burning in your own fireplace is everyone’s freedom, it is the right given by law, but the blue sky and the sun are More worthy of the yearning.” Luke Samuel, a member of the soot reduction association, echoed the feeling of referring to the rented horse lane. “We should have passed, and Mary urgently needs some helpers. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stallin. Summer is pretending to add:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe Some members will come to the feast, the Beckland region, or the kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Imagine the grandeur of this banquet." Klein politely Complimented, I watched the Summerrs get out of the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he turned his body and prepared to go to the postbox at the end of the street, a postman wearing a dark green uniform drove in a carriage and went to the letter box at his door. A letter was delivered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My letter? Klein pulled out a bunch of keys and chose the one with a quaint color that was almost brass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Master Key" easily opened the letter box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can only take this key out of the house in the future... Klein swears, takes out the subscribed newspaper and the letter just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter is from Essinger Stanton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also read the old unbroken serial killings yesterday, picking out the most suspicious ones, and through the police department, initially confirmed the corresponding The current situation of the suspect, so I wrote to private investigators such as Klein and Kaslana who are interested in this direction to share their gains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes exactly the two things that Klein focused on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The famous big detectives saw the same thing... I just wrote the letter... Klein self-adjusted and returned to the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Essinger’s description, the case of randomly killing late returners has investigated many people, but they have not been able to lock the suspects. After many years, think again. Re-finding clues is already very difficult and almost hopeless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another case, the four suspects, one is a teenager, his mother is also a victim, a prostitute, a single, and only one child, He was abused by his mother and was solitary and sullen. He was the first object suspected by the police. However, less than half a year after the case, he was seriously injured in the gangster fire in the Eastern District. He died in a charity hospital. indoor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body was burned to ashes and buried in the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, he is unlikely to be associated with the current serial killings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no cremation, I will definitely dig the grave to confirm... Klein of the scam is seriously considering the possibility of the other party’s scam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining three suspects, one has repeatedly moved in the past few years, the police have lost their grasp of his situation and need more time to pursue, One experienced bankruptcy and entered the Eastern District from the North District. One remained as it was and the grocery store was still in the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein re-extracted a piece of stationery, first described the situation, and then asked the recipient to secretly observe the two suspects with specific addresses, he emphasized道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The murderers of serial killings are cruel, fierce, and highly aggressive. Please be careful not to be too close to them, just like you are just ordinary The neighbors observe the same thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The information I need is their recent mental state, such as whether it is violent, whether they like to keep themselves in the room, very Less communication with people, whether you have beaten others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the information he got from the "Sun". After each kill, the "Devil" will follow The ritual requirements, eat the victim's internal organs, and always in a state of bloodthirsty maniac want to hurt others until the new victim appears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After stressing that it was necessary to pay attention to its own safety, Klein folded the letter paper, stuffed it into a new envelope, and put a black stamp on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he wrote down the name of the recipient:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stuart Detective "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens, a luxury villa in the Earl of Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su's in the corner of the study, seemingly boring to observe the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Hall, who had a belly, took a pipe and said to the eldest son in front of him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Hibbert, do you know why I have to let you enter the Air Pollution Investigation Committee?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hibert Hall has long thoughts Answer: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to influence the development of relevant laws and policies?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, although I am the second largest shareholder of the Conston Coal and Steel Complex, I am not too concerned about this issue. I have been urging them to make corresponding adjustments. Governing air pollution is the future trend. For this, I have no doubts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hibert, although our family has a fixed upper house, you will become a member of the House of Representatives sooner or later, but in addition to the speaker, etc. The identity of the person, why is the same as the upper house, some nobles will have greater influence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hibbert thought about the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knights, wealth, business status, and relationships within the government and the military?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s just a part of it. In addition, it has the ability to handle affairs. People always trust the same kind of people who have rich experience and participated in many things. If you want to make a difference in politics in the future, you have to participate as much as possible in addition to inheriting seats. All kinds of affairs, showing corresponding abilities, are gradually active in the sights of the Honourable Members, so that they can feel that you are trustworthy. This is the influence of your own."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hibbert, take a look at the Republic of Intis, take a look at the current situation of their aristocrats, you should understand that as time goes by and the development of society, the privilege on the bright side will Being weakened, the title will become less and less important, just an honorary title, the status of the business field and its own influence is what you should pay attention to." Earl Hall explained in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you meet something that you are not good at?" Hebrier said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That pretends that you can handle it. Don't worry if it will waste money, form a professional team, listen to their opinions, and make decisions. Everyone There are a lot of areas that are not good at it, only money is omnipotent." Earl Hall said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hibert replied in vain:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, Dad." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Su Shi next to him yawned bored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it’s over, it slips into Audrey’s studio and repeats everything he hears, and ends up muttering:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand what they are talking about..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey listened thoughtfully, smiled :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a good thing that you don't have to smell the pungent smell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is it?" Su Shi seems to understand and understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey did not answer it and turned to another thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She originally intended to quietly guide members to pay attention to the bad conditions in the East, Factory and Docklands, but in the last two social gatherings, she found herself looking for Not a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles, the members of the council, the senior government employees, will not talk about similar topics at all, and they will not be able to guide them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
