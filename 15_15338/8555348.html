			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? Let me check myself? Klein almost suspected that this was the intentional temptation of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organization that uses Tarot cards as a symbol is really interesting, I think so, but I don’t want to sell myself... Yes, Kaping’s things are obvious. Not simple, he has a full four extraordinary protection, there must be a small force behind it, what is the difference between this case and the involvement of the upper class? Amount, this is not something Sherlock. Moriarty should know... Klein’s expression of thoughts and thoughts: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to find a mysterious The organization is not easy, and it is very dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talim’s answer to him seems to have been expected, hehe laughed:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock, you don't need to take risks, the big man means to pay more attention to collecting the corresponding intelligence or rumors, here is 5 pounds of cash, it is the funds he gave you, even if you If you don’t get any valuable news, you won’t be returned, and once you get a useful clue, he will pay for each item and reimburse you for the entire process.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So good conditions? The big man valued this matter... Is it related to the forces behind Kaping, or is he hoping to find a mysterious organization code-named Tarot to help him? Reimbursement... It’s been a long time since I heard people promise me this kind of thing... The other side talked about this level. If a private detective refuses, it seems too suspicious... and investigates this kind of thing. Obviously, I should be in my own hands... Klein hesitated for a few seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I try my best."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not politely taken the five 1 pound denominations handed by Talim, intending to provide a plausible clue every other week or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora is not looking for "fool"? "Folly" is obviously a tarot card! I hope that the big man will pursue all the way, and remove Mr. A... Klein gradually got some ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground part of the Church of St. Seychelles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Soulist" Soest summoned the players to discuss what to do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Leonard Mitchell, who was so green-eyed, half-inquiry, half of the test site:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are responsible for it, how do you plan to investigate the two Tarot-related cases?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenner De raised his hand and combed his hair, smiling: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, follow the previous line of thought, and go backwards to trace the person or organization who is looking for the 'fool' believer, They may know something. Second, re-examine the first two cases, put all the people involved in the list, regardless of whether there is any suspicion! Then rely on the ability of 'nightmare' to ask, the exclusion, the devil may It’s hidden in the details and hidden in people who seem impossible.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soest laughed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have read the file. The two cases involve a lot of people. They live in different places and want to re-examine it. It is quite difficult, and there are some People themselves are extraordinary people who are active in the underground world. They know how to hide themselves. We have no way to grasp their whereabouts. If you follow your thoughts, you need more than just a small team. The church must at least put in five sequences. The value of the night and the corresponding support staff."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The focus of our responsibility is to summon the devil's case." Another red glove reminded Leonard of a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard was not angry, smiled low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, I am just Providing opinions, not adopting, to what extent, is the right of Captain Soest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused, revealing a confused expression:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am puzzled, why the cases of the two Tarot rituals are not of high priority, the former involves the event of the evil god attempting to come, than the simple summoning demon I don't know how many times more serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soest took a sip of coffee and replied slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The number of nights is limited, so the case must have a certain priority, and Tarot The secret organization represented by the card has not shown obvious malice to us so far. Their actions have helped us in a sense, for example, to destroy the advent of the 'real creator'. For example, let us Knowing that Kaping is not a simple trafficker, there is a big secret behind it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, he outlined the corner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe they can help us find out more bad things.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, the necessary investigation is Certainly there is no one who can guarantee that the secret organization will not be enemies with us in the future. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, Captain Soest, we focus on the case of summoning demons." Leonard said with sincerity.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland’s winter total It was separated from the fireplace and the mist, and the time passed by in such a cold and gray feeling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be just a blink of an eye, leaving the New Year Half a month.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein extinguished the charcoal in the fireplace and put a double-breasted coat over the crimson wool vest.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly three weeks ago, Reppard finally got the patent for the bicycle and started looking for a suitable second round of investors, steam-powered tycoon Franmi Cage said A certain interest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After several contacts, the three parties made the final negotiation today.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In this more than a month, Klein was too shocked, and with the investigation of the case, the smashing of the potion was cumbersome and tidy. Now that the distance is completely completed, there is a big active performance.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t have too urgent things, you can’t take risks, and for another month, it’s almost the same... Klein’s thoughts diverged and removed the top from the coat rack. Half-height silk hat, brushed and wrinkled with a brush and handkerchief to remove dust.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badge left by Llanus points to the January 4th party. He didn't have the idea to go there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this time, the "Tarot Club" was still on a weekly basis, and Klein got it. A few pages of Russell's early diary witnessed the other party's conversion from a weak bird who only dreamed of not acting to become an active hunting dude.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, he has almost no other gains. Although the extraordinary character of "Werewolf" was handed over to the "downside man" through the "world", the business involving more than a thousand pounds is obviously not so easy to achieve, and "werewolf" The cursed features have also discouraged many interested parties.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Tarot gathering a few days, "The Hanged Man" told the "world", he said he contacted on a steam church "artisans", the other obviously a little heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that this week will be able to get the 'winder' formula that Mr. 'reverse man' needs, there is no clue..." Klein packed up with him. Items, put on a cane, wear a hat, and walk out of the door - the "Winner" potion formula belongs to the sequence 6, not so easy to encounter, "downside down" Alger waited for more than a month, also failed I heard good news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey was finally recognized by the "Psychological Alchemy Association" after undergoing long-term observation and test. She reported to Mr. Fool, saying I should be able to formally join the secret organization this week, hoping to get a blessing in advance, so as to avoid accidents. For this reason, she prepares to search for "Psychological Alchemy" and at least ten pages of Russell's diary dedicated to "Folly", no need remuneration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the dragon specimen in the treasure house of the Duke of Nigan, she has confirmed that it is a "thousands of hunters", but the problem is that it is a simple specimen, no corresponding The extraordinary characteristics, and no blood flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2,000 pounds she owes to Mr. "The Fool" will not be repaid until next February and March, because she is officially an adult after the New Year’s ball, although I can get some of the control of the property, but I still have to be supervised by my parents, and I can't sell it at will. Moreover, she still has the last payment of the Viscount Glylin, so I have to have enough time to cover up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
