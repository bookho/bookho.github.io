"砰!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein continues to make sounds, making end-to-end connections Two air bombs, so that they still rush to the enemy's chest, trying to rely on constant blows, completely break the defense there! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he saw that Uttraski’s bishop had a heavy and generous sword, as if the light condensed into a giant sword, and used it to cleverly block it. Two air bombs, the sound of Dangdang is almost inseparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uttraski is only stepping forward, just stepping on the church like shaking, at the same time, his two-handed sword, from top to bottom In the form of a broken building, he turned to Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword is not yet there, and the wind that is blowing up makes Klein almost unable to maintain balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of terror! When flashing such a thought, Klein skillfully jumped out to the side and bent over to prepare for the tumbling on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uttraski’s two-handed sword smashed on the ground, smashing the slate, and the crack spread quickly around it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stab! He dragged the giant sword, rubbed the surface, and swayed it into a sweep, bringing a slip of Mars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trick is for the opponent who loves to roll! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was about to land, but in his mind, he immediately appeared in the picture that he was swept by the two-handed sword. He was busy with his arms, and he pressed it lightly. Jumping up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! The wind blows away the dust on the ground, and the terrible giant sword sweeps the nearby chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Klein still has a counterattack in the future, the "Giant" bishop's attack has come to an end, without pause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One sword, two swords, three swords... Five swords, six swords, seven swords... Uttrasky seems to have plenty of physical strength, no Intermittent, stormy attacks have lasted for dozens of seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein jumped from time to time, sometimes tumbling, and sometimes ran away. He did not find the opportunity to display his ability. He was so embarrassed and in jeopardy. If he had lost the match in different corners of the church in advance, there were still some candles on both sides that had not been extinguished. "Flash", he is afraid that he has been shackled by the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t want to be an extraordinary profession that is good at fighting... No mistakes, no weaknesses... Klein didn’t panic and evade, Always looking for enemy vulnerabilities, waiting for the opponent's attack to enter the mitigation phase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he discovered a problem with Uttrasky swordsmanship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the two-handed sword is too long and too big, there are obvious defects in the close combat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea flashed, Klein took advantage of the opportunity of the giant sword, first turned to the left front, then the palm of the hand, quickly flew to Ute Ralphsky between the legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a "semi-giant" who is more than two meters tall, Uttraski is only standing normally, his legs are also divided, silver The white ankle is clearly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just rolling over there, Klein’s left hand has penetrated into the pocket, pulling out a strip of paper, turning it into a hard, sharp cane, inserting it The gap in the side of the enemy's escort is inserted into the body of the "giant" bishop! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be a fatal blow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he was in a glimpse of his mind, with a huge sword inserted in his mind, endless ray bursts and a horrific storm engulfing his own picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trap! Uttrasky's trap! Klein didn't hesitate, and his right hand slammed forward and jumped out of the gap between the legs of the "giant" bishop and jumped behind his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he made this action, Uttraski had gripped the hilt with both hands, bending his back and piercing the giant sword straight up and down The slate in front of it. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the sound of the shackles, there was another morning light on the blade, which turned into a hurricane and swept around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent place, the place where Klein was originally, the slate disappeared, the soil below was thinner by nearly ten centimeters, Uttraski’s legs The silver-white armor of the crotch is also hurt, and the inch is broken, revealing the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His trap is to exchange his own injuries for the demise of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein, who jumped behind Utrefsky’s bishop, finally found a chance to counterattack. He forced his body to twist in the air and smashed the gang. Simulated a gunshot at the back of the enemy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two air bombs hit Utravsky’s backs, first cracking the silver-white metal at that position, then letting it fall apart, revealing no Any place of protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is about to give a fatal blow, Uttrasky suddenly straightens his body, turns his back, and violently sweeps out his two-handed sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This speed is so fast, the attack is so fierce, Klein seems to have been difficult to avoid, but he took a piece of paper from his pocket, in time Blocked in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collision between the giant sword and the paper, the sound of the metal was hit hard, the crisp echoes were deafening and filled the entire church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was shot like a tennis ball, and the paper in his hand was split, leaving only a little between his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the air, he immediately faced Utravsky’s violent and quick pursuit without a pause, and the situation was in jeopardy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he did not have the slightest panic, just shook his wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! The Great Sword cut off the flame, but it did not cause any damage, but only created a little ignition star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a candle on the right side of the church, the dim fireworks spread steeply, drawing a face painted with oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein re-presented and pulled out a strip of paper from his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his wrist, the paper turned into a tough whip, and the surface of the whip burned with a red flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Snapped! Snapped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein swaggered and slammed the "giant" bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his weapon was quickly disintegrated under the cover of the bright hands and the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the purpose of Klein! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪,啪,啪! He even slammed his fingers and let the ground spurt another fire beam to block Uttrasky and burn the other side's armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recovery of Dawn Armor is quite slow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fire was swallowing, Uttraski’s legs were burnt with black marks and redness was flowing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this did not affect the agility of the "giant" bishop, he suddenly snorted, just like a steam train finally accelerated to the highest point, fast and fast Heavy and fiercely smashed the heavy flame and rushed to the front of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is incredibly fast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Utravsky’s two-handed sword smashed and turned into a patch of light, sweeping around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost instantaneously, Klein fell into a mortal situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few matches he had stored alone were ignited, and a strong flame wrapped him completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, this is not the speed of the "Light Storm" sweeping, red is just present, immediately swallowed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s body was torn apart, but they lost their thickness and became shredded paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Utravsky, a red flame leaped and Klein came out from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out the matchbox in the other side pocket and threw it at the enemy. It seemed to ignite all the remaining matches at once and through the constraints of a small space. Create a certain degree of explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this matchbox is pointing to the position that Uttraski has no protection for! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein raised his right hand and made a snap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Utravsky bishop jumped up and bent his knees and put his legs together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sound of the sound is the matchbox that has not changed, it is a loud bang, it is an accurate opening of the lack of protection of the Uttrasky Bishop. The air bomb in the back of the head is a deadly thing that has been prepared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skull is cracked, blood and white spots are spilling, Uttraski is turning around and opening his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒, the matchbox fell on the ground that was pitted by the Storm of Light, but still not ignite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
