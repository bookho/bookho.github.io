			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein’s eyelids returned to normal, Crestel Sesima smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You can move around to adapt to changes in the body and find the core competencies brought by the 'Clown' potion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded, I thought that I might need the guidance of a senior deacon, so I didn’t care about the presence of outsiders. I took a step forward according to the content of repeated practice during this time, twisting my arms and swinging my arms, and slamming my arms. fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the crisp sound of his fist breaking the air, and he felt that the strength of the forward was completely beyond his expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, he is like sitting on a train on a sudden brake, and the whole person is out of balance and dumps forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops! To leave the same black history as Leonard... Klein’s thoughts flashed and he was ready to fall, but at this time, he found that he could effectively control his muscles under such conditions. Control the body and control the center of gravity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spine, tendons, ligaments, etc., at the same time, he adjusted his center of gravity in an instant, and stood in a distorted posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm... Klein, who has made a clear understanding, has made several sets of actions in succession, confirming that his biggest change is that the coordination of the body has been greatly improved. There are no special circumstances and there will be almost no obvious imbalance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It feels like a tumbler...can perform acrobatics...It’s not difficult to walk on a water pipe...not a 'clown' potion ..." One thought flashed, and Klein tried to improve the strength, agility, and speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it will not be worse than that of Gao Wen’s current situation. After fully adapting and carrying out targeted exercises, there will definitely be stronger... And with my current control of the body, the mastery of fighting skills will also become simple..." Klein stopped the action and nodded thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his original thoughts, it’s almost half a year to be a good fighter, the common man’s definition of fighting, but taking the “clown” potion After that, he felt that maybe one month, or even two or three weeks, he could become a "policeman" who is proficient in fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the difference between an extraordinary person and an ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different "natural talents" of different extraordinary people have in some sense surpassed the human level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cresthe quietly watched the new "clown" try various moves until the other party completely stopped, and then gently bowed: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough to be a potion in the field of fighting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait for Klein to speak, he asked instead :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What voice did you hear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard someone whispering" Hornachs'." Klein temporarily concealed the word "Fregra". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intends to observe the reaction of the senior deacon of Sesima first. If the other party is willing to tell the Hornages and the night country, then he will I also heard different content as a reason to add omissions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crested slightly invisible, skipped this topic and reminded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You have to remember that in the same sequence approach, a high sequence strong can affect the corresponding low- and medium-sequence extraordinary, to some extent, in a sense, that the path contains the domain. Demigod, the slang or shouts you hear, may be the content that they deliberately conveyed and are malicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this sequence belongs to a certain evil spirit I need to be more vigilant. I just talked to Dunn. The night-time person whose team has recently lost control is a similar situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Sesima, I will remember, I will not be tempted by those slang and shouts, and will not be polluted by them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, He thought of another thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the church only provides the "sleeper" and "collector" pathways and conceals most of the other sequences. ? After all, the former belongs to the "night goddess", is the self-family, and the latter's corresponding "death" has fallen. The reason why you can choose "the voyeur" and the "divination" is because these two occupations are auxiliary and effective. To make up for the shortcomings of the "sleeper" and "collector" pathways in sequence 9 and sequence 8, and it is the beginning itself, the cumulative effect is not much...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this can't be explained, even the name of the potion, the corresponding characteristics, and the problems that need to be noticed when it is almost vacant...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, see Crestel Sesimema put on the box and was ready to leave. Klein was busy converging his thoughts and asked with the attitude of asking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hi Sesima, I want to know how Playing the 'clown', do you want to go to the circus?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cresley took up the tall, tall collar, laughing low:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the current philosophical field, you are making a formalistic mistake."<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must understand that the name of the potion represents not only a profession, but also a type of person, a person with common characteristics, such as 'divination', we can change the description, 'peep into the fate but again People who fear the fate, of course, I have just mentioned that the rules of behavior summed up by everyone who took the same potion are more or less different. Can you completely refer to the experience of others and understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has a thoughtful thought:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I probably understand some, as long as I can grasp Living in the essence, can you play the 'clown' in your life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In theory, this is the case." Crestel replied cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I understand." Klein drew a red moon on his chest. "Thank you, Lord Sesima, may Goddess bless you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, what is the essence of the "clown"? Regardless of the various extensions of the clown on the earth, just in the current world, the clown is a ridiculous way to entertain other people's professions, such as funny makeup, exaggerated movements, acrobatic performances? The core is the absurd way, or the entertainment of others, always feels not right... Do you want to consider the previous court clown? Klein thought silently and got into confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creiter looked at him and also pointed out the blushing month on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiles slightly in his eyes and smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May Goddess also protect you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Klein suddenly had an intuition, a near-premonition instincts, that is, Seychela’s senior deacon will follow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he saw Crested carrying a silver box and took his left foot to the door of the alchemy room! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by step, three steps, Klein looked at the other side out of the hidden door and disappeared into the underground passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...He first made a fuss, and immediately felt a strong joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary power of the "Clown" potion is stronger than he imagined! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can rely on intuition to predict the next step of your goal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability, coupled with superior coordination, superior agility and speed, is still the power that can be called the so-called skill fighting? Klein thought about it in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this is also considered a "divination" ability in the sequence of 8, but not enough ... this approach should indeed be a high sequence before each promotion Get the kind of unique ability... However, the intuition of the hunch is fleeting, there is no way to grasp it every time... Of course, this is strong enough, and once you hold it, there is a good chance that it will be defeated... When the negative impact of the "Clown" potion is reduced to a stage that can be controlled, I have to try again to "call" my own ritual, and almost forget this thing... Well, the captain must have infected me! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
