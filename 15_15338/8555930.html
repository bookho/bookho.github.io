			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visitor was a man in a dark green postman uniform, and he smiled happily at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it Mr. Sherlock. Mr. Moriarty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Klein vaguely guessed the other party's intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visitor immediately raised his right hand and handed a black gauze layer of slap-sized things:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Your parcel, trouble sign for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein deliberately reveals his doubts:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Normally, shouldn't you give me a list, let me go to the corresponding post office to get it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The postal system of the Kingdom of Lun is perfectly reproduced in Intis, even the shortcomings have been copied a lot. Any mail that can't be directly inserted into the letter box, no matter what, they will only give the "receipt order", so that the recipient is busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...haha, because it is more expensive, it must be delivered to you personally." The postman snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that you are not professional enough, not a real postman... Klein has not asked more questions, took the parcels, pens and lists, and signed the brush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the door and return to the living room. He was not in a hurry to unpack the parcel, but took out a gold coin and juggled it into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein caught the gold coin and looked down at the portrait or the number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number is up, it means negation, there is no hidden danger... Klein nodded slightly, put away the gold coins, touched the paper people in the pocket of the clothes, carefully Disassemble the parcel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A layer of black gauze is opened, the inside of the thing is clearly displayed in his line of sight, respectively, the color of pale gold, elegant pocket watch a handkerchief stained with dark red blood, seven or eight brown short curly hairs tied together and a stack of notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talim’s belongings, hair, flesh and blood, daily records, all together... Prince Edsac’s work is very efficient, it’s all still Not at night... Kline looked at the things that were spread out on the coffee table, and suddenly felt that there were many eyes watching at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ancient family of angels that has been inherited for more than two thousand years, the foundation is absolutely beyond imagination, and the roll involved in the royal family can be crushed into powder anytime and anywhere... ...maybe I have been monitored now... I have to be mediocre enough, useless enough to keep myself safe... Klein has already thought about what to do, and I don't have to worry about checking my pocket watch, handkerchief and hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, his spiritual intuition did not give any warning and did not prevent him from divining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After having a little bit of heart, Klein was in the living room, took out the stationery, picked up the pen, and wrote the divination statement:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talim Dumont's real cause of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is generous and open-minded, does not seem to feel that there is Be monitored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick up the curls and the handkerchief, and Klein meditates on the divination statement, and then leans back against the back of the sofa, and the eyes turn deep into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven times, he came to the dream world and saw the familiar Craig Club Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, he once again witnessed Tallim Dumont pinching his heart and his face twisting and twisting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This revelation shows that Tallim did die from a sudden heart disease..." Klein opened his eyes and whispered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned, revealing a puzzled, incomprehensible and thoughtful expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried several times with different divination statements and got the same result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got up and walked back and forth several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clenched his fist to his head, and seemed to be angry at his own level, unable to help his friends to find out the real murderer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he sat down and stayed for a long time, in a dimly lit room like a silhouette of a stone statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost, you can’t use too much force... If no one is monitoring, I’m just fighting with the air... Klein sneered and turned to the kitchen . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, he seems to be invigorating and carefully read the contents of the stack of notes, including the day of Tali’s death and the days before. What, who I have seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home, Red Rose Manor, Craig Club, Conrad’s Mansion... Nothing unusual... Klein picked up the sharpened pencil, I drew a number of circles to mark the places to visit in the next few days and the goals to be asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he sighed long, packed his belongings with no confidence, washed and slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red moon was covered by layers of clouds in the middle of the night, Klein suddenly opened his eyes and woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned over and got out of bed, slowly opened the door, entered the bathroom next door, and concealed the body with a paper man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After four steps, he came over the fog and sat down to the position of the "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes have become clear, no more decadent, depressed, pessimistic and other emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, Klein took out the projection of the bloody handkerchief from the pajamas pocket of the old clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he packed up the items before, he used the extraordinary ability of the "magician" to cover the handkerchief invisibly and hide it on his body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a breath, Klein has a paper pen and wrote a divination statement that is no different from the beginning:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The real cause of death of Tallim Dumont."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmly and quietly recited seven times, he took paper and The handkerchief, leaning against the back of the chair, fell asleep in the quiet and empty ancient palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray, detached, illusory world, Klein saw a picture that was completely different from before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presented in his eyes is a hand-picked puppet-sized puppet with eyes, nose and mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The puppet has a few drops of dark red blood on his body, which has been dyed with a few demon colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One palm stretched out, the skin was fair and delicate, smooth and sleek, the five fingers were slender and slender, and the flesh was even. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most striking thing is that the little finger of this palm is wearing a ring with sapphire and a unique shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The index finger of the palm of the hand lingers on the illusory black flame, which is in the heart of the puppet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sound, the picture was broken, and Klein woke up from the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His initial judgment was not wrong, Tallim did die of curse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the problem is that they all got the curse of the moment, why didn't they show the panorama? This mysterious space above the fog can eliminate interference... Klein has some doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, the revelation is too abstract, too easy to misread, is a problem of his own divination level, and it is too difficult to divination. The problem, which has nothing to do with fog, is understandable, but it is quite puzzling that it has clearly shown the scene before and after the curse, but it is limited to a small part and does not provide a relatively more effective revelation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before... Is there a similar situation? Klein tapped the reason from his own experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he sat up straight and remembered the similar experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tingen, when he was divined for the real reason behind several coincidences, there was a similar situation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly saw the house with the red chimney, but could not touch the Ins. Zangweier and the seal "0-08" in the house! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, is this the level of the "0" seal level or the power of people against the fog? Klein squinted his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not necessarily, there are still many possibilities, you have to confirm it! He tried to calm down his mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how to confirm, it’s hard to beat him with experience. The method is very simple, that is to do the same divination again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the picture of the revelation has not changed, it means that things are not so terrible. If divination is no longer successful, it means that something near the target or target can be To some extent against the fog, like "0-08"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indulge in a deep breath, Klein calmly repeats the previous divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The real cause of death of Tallim Dumont."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned against the back of the chair, whispered, and his eyes gradually turned deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream, what he saw was awkward, broken fog, no puppets and fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swipe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein straightened his back and looked very dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to Tallim? He frowned and said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is to do it. He has no doubts, that is, negative absenteeism, perfunctory responsibilities, first slap Prince Edsack for a while, then tell him to investigate No truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, the world is terrible, and you will be exposed to extremely horrible things if you accidentally... Klein sighs, dare not stop, and returns quickly. The bathroom in reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday at 9 am, Crown Cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wore a black shirt, black vest and black coat, holding flowers bought by 12 Sule, standing on the edge of the crowd, his face condensed The coffin of Tallim Dumont was lifted up, accepted the soul, and buried a little bit into the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, Talim’s mother’s eyes were red and swollen, and she wanted to speak a few times, but she couldn’t make a sound. His father’s hair was white and his face was only standing. There is a bit of tremor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene is reflected in the blind, Klein slightly tilted his head and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who attended the funeral left, and he walked over, bent down and placed the white flowers in his hand on the same kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry... he said quietly in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing straight, retreating to the side, ready to leave, Klein found that reporter Mike and surgeon Allen came together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a shame, I didn’t think Talim turned out to be, oh...” Mike’s expression was so painful that he could not finish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan has always been cold and faint, took off his glasses, rubbed his eyes, and whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "He is a passionate guy, there should be no such ending."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, he had hope to get rid of the badness left by his grandfather Fame." Klein echoed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he saw a female figure wearing a thick black dress and wearing a veil facing the front of Tallim’s grave, holding the same in his hand. A bunch of white flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not care to remove his gaze, only the remaining light aimed at the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
