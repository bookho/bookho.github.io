			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hermes? This is the ancient strongman... Klein looked frowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a solid and mysterious foundation, and he knows exactly which era the old gentleman who created the ancient Hermes is active. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the giants who ruled the earth, the second century of the dragon's soaring sky, in a sense, appeared in humans earlier than the god of war and the goddess of the earth." In history, in other words, I didn’t join the small “sun” before the Tarot meeting. I didn’t know the Seven Gods, but I mostly heard the name of Hermes. Well, wait for the opportunity to confirm the 'World’...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old gentleman experienced the thorns of the human ancestors to try their own medicine and step by step to find extraordinary power. He is based on the giant language dragon. Standing on the shoulders of a pioneer, he creatively invented a set of extraordinary language that belongs to human beings. He has seen the first 'stone slate' with great probability! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He actually lived in the period of Russell the Great, and may even live to the present! This is the living fossil of human occultism!" Klein felt a sigh of relief Another aspect realized the terrible "Twilight Hermit". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as Hermes is a member! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And other hidden organizations, even within the Church of the Seven Gods, often use ancient Hermes in the sacrifices and rituals! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Twilight Hermit" is really high-end, atmosphere, grade... Klein couldn't help but sigh in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most enviable thing for him is not that the "Twilight Hermits" actually has the legendary character of Hermes, who is in the same history as human history, but the other party holds the second piece. Meteorite." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is cheating! Klein thought that Tarot would only have one-twentieth of the "Big Card" and it would be awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He puts his focus back on the paper and continues reading the rest of the previous diary:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh my God! Sitting next to me looks like ordinary ordinary man is actually Hermes, he has lived from the Dark Second Age to the fifth era of extraordinary decline!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This organization is right! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw my bright future, not having three exclamation points to describe my mood at this time!!!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This big man, these old people don't die, get together, just believe in the view of the 'Twilight Hermitage' that has been passed down to the present? No, it is not like this, at least I am not! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There must be some people who enthusiastically believe in those ideas, purely wanting to wait for the original Creator to wake up, and let the progress of history advance to that node as expected Oh, as I understand it, most of them are not waking up, but resurrection.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But such people will not be more than half, and the rest will have their own purposes. The guy, either belongs to my ambitious family, or is a latent 25-year-old boy. Wait a minute, I think of a problem. After I promised the secret invitation, I quickly attended the party and never reviewed it. The convenor of the party said that for my participation, members had differences and had to vote. With more than two-thirds of the consent, I was barely allowed, but this is not the key. The key is that they don’t care whether I believe in it. The idea of ​​approaching dusk does not mean that I have a variety of ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do they rely on to confirm that I will not endanger this organization? Is there a high sequence of strong people in the 'audience' approach, reaching the height of the angels? The strong sequence, he unconsciously, with my verbal commitment to plant secret psychological cues, and have enough confidence to discover the hidden malicious members?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is really possible, but it makes people feel chilling." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, if you don't get permission, once you mention the name of the organization to the outside world, you will be immediately noticed, and they even gave me a few The former member who has been cleared is an example... even if it is written on paper, even if it uses the newly invented language, it will not work! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, I think, the sequence 2 of the 'audience' approach is 'insighter', the sequence 1 is the 'writer', who is there to match Characteristics? (Note 1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I initially had a skeptical object, that is the convenor of the party.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Right, and the sequence of the 'audience' approach, its The name is: 'dream home'! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I don't think anyone here has reached the rank of true God, otherwise there is no need to hide behind the scenes. Of course, they may have sequence 0 level artifacts. For example, the 'uniqueness' of a certain route may be that it creates a real dream that connects the two sides of the mainland, and has the ability to react when the name of the 'Twilight Hermitage' is mentioned.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't think so much at the time. I was shocked and asked about other things. For example, in the description of the gods, why is there a word for 'rights', Mr. Hermes makes A wonderful answer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Klein found that the diary of this page has reached the end.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is busy Going to the next page, but soon back again, because the diary and the front are not connected.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer? It’s in the original diary On the next page, is it too long to be too lazy to write, or not necessary to record in the diary? Klein wants to cross the past, hold Russell's neck and let him tell Hermes's answer!<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he does not have any emotional fluctuations on his face, and there is no extra body language.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original 'audience 'The sequence of the route 0 is called 'dream home', which corresponds to the 'dream dragon'. I thought it would be 'the dragon'... 'the dreamer' is closer to human cognition, that is, taking The corresponding sequence 0 potion does not necessarily become a dragon...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 1 'writer', only listen to the potion name, I I feel that the characteristics of the '0-08' feather pen are somewhat similar...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'Twilight Hermitage' convene members by relying on a cross-strait Real dreams? The 'miracle' description at the beginning of the diary scared me. I thought they also had a mysterious space above the fog and fog...” Klein regained his emotions and found that the effective information provided by this page diary is very important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he knew that the ancient sage of Hermes had lived at least for Russell, one hundred and two hundred years ago, and was a member of that mysterious organization. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, starting from Russell’s unspeakable description of the name of the organization, he basically confirmed that the mysterious organization is equal to the “Twilight Hermit Society.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he knows the sequence 0, sequence 1 and sequence 2 names of the "audience" approach, although it will not be used for a while, but it really enriches its own mysterious accumulation.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it’s time for Miss Justice to ask related questions... Her curiosity has always been heavy... Klein forced herself to forget the missing answers and turned it over The last page of the diary.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reads while "Justice" Audrey habitually observed all kinds of details, and keenly found that the "Black Emperor" card that Mr. "Footer" covered on the mottled table was gone!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Give the deceased, provide the corresponding help, or, which object is exchanged with the object? Audrey's eye flashes slightly, try to guess the reason.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is more inclined to the first thought, because without the help of Mr. "fool", his leader may not be able to destroy the advent ceremony of the "real creator."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, Dad can't see the file that recorded the detailed passage, otherwise I can know who the "fool" is. He is a medium man, a male, wearing the most popular double-breasted long in Lun. The dress, at the time of the red rose manor, through this information investigation, may be able to lock the target... but it may provoke the "fool", he did not let me expose the identity of his apostle... Audrey, not much Think, don't be curious, maybe you will meet in the future, you will know... "Justice" Audrey took back his sight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Klein was a little bit smirking because of the contents of the last page of the diary:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On March 16th, I participated in the aristocratic dance of this country for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ladies and husbands are much better than I thought. In the novels I have read, there is no bathing in the medieval world, and disguising disgusting by perfume. Body odor, often stepping on the sputum, describing the face with something that is prone to heavy metal poisoning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
