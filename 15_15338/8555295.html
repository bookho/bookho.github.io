			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, the palace is quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein fingers rubbed the edge of the bronze long table with rhythm and concentrated on thinking about the countermeasures against the threat of Aurora and Mr. A. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the inability to understand the true intentions of the other party, he instinctively got an idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Report Mr. A! Report illegal gatherings! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein can easily know from the "Magician" where Mr. A convened the meeting, thus concealing to the night, the punitive or the mechanical Heart report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Aurora will make you pay enough attention! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Mr. A may not be able to save himself, let alone to trace the "fool" believers. The problem is that it will certainly involve a group of innocent extraordinary people, and Klein suspects that this is the reason why Mr. A directly rewards the "fool" believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may have already arranged the way back. Once he has been reported, he can clearly confirm the person who had "fool" in the previous meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for who it is, it doesn't matter, Mr. A and the glamour of the Aurora will definitely do something to catch the mistake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the mortal, as long as they fall into their hands, most people can’t hide the secret again, the Aurora, or the “real creator” The "Shepherd" approach is best at polluting others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the extraordinary view of the three is completely distorted, and from the heart of the "real creator", what else can be kept secret? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no other way, it is best not to report... Klein leaned back to the back of the chair, converge on the chaotic thoughts, and reorganize the whole thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, he suddenly found a problem:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world does not exist at all Believers and prostitutes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the members of the Tarot Club are only a few, and no one has disclosed the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Aurora will not find the corresponding clues at all... Nothing to worry about... The only bad result is that "fool" is "real" The Creator "hangs the number there, and the feeling of being remembered by a evil spirit is not so good, but it basically does not affect other aspects... Klein nodded thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He considered it very clearly, the only flaw in the whole thing was that he used the title of "fool" written by Guhmiswen as the password for the unregistered account. But with the sacrifice and the ritual proved to be useful, this account has been abandoned for a long time and has long been forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been the case since the last month and a half, no one has been concerned about Klein by copying the password. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, those bankers who have been exposed to passwords but who are obviously ignorant of occult can’t disclose this to anyone else, and those who are extraordinary use Lunwen asked that even if the right person was found, the other party could not link the content described by Lunwen with the ancient Hermes code. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone transcribes, I will be able to make an effective response in the first place... Besides, even if someone finds a password problem, It’s hard to trace to Sherlock. Moriarty. Every time I use certain means... "Mr. Justice" is also very careful when saving money... In the slap of the slap, Klein relaxes and lightens Laughter: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You think that 'fool' has many believers and many believers, so there must be many indelible clues?<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wrong, big mistakes, there is only one believer and awkward in the 'fool'! That is me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he couldn’t help but laugh at himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't seem to be worth it." Proud things..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I have to be cautious. I don’t play the banner of “The Fool”... Klein reminded herself and turned to the “Magician”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He adjusted his posture, and his voice said quietly and slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't care." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't care... Firth got a surprise for her, I think it should be the answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of Mr. Fool, Aurora will be just a group of ants! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls once again scorned the name, curiously asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Mr. Fool", which one does Aurora believe in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, she saw Mr. "The Fool" sitting on the high back chair in the middle of the fog, gesture Leisurely said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The real creator."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real creator...Fuls eyes fierce The mantle was big, and I immediately understood the reason why Mr. A suddenly looked for "fool" believers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Sun" teenager of Silver City succeeded with the help of Tarot Club Debunking the anomaly of the exploration team and defeating the plot of the "real creator"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind this matter is the confrontation and struggle between Mr. "Foolish Man" and "Real Creator"... Fols did not dare to ask more, and will soon Today, I met the members of the Abraham family and talked briefly about Lawrence's will, mentioning the strange notes and the extraordinary characteristics of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear ‘fool’, what should I do?” She asked less confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to do it? Miss "Magician" is very lucky... Why haven't I encountered such a good thing... Kline replied with a low smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to you The most real thoughts in my heart are to do it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not worried that Dorian Gray of the Pritzker Fishermen’s Association will endanger the “Magician” because He knows that there are two stones in the other's bracelet, and he can also perform two spiritual transmissions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most real thoughts in my heart? Folth thoughtfully lowered his head: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand, thank you, Mr. 'fool'."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She decided to buy a steam train ticket tomorrow - in this type of transportation, it takes only an hour from Beckland to Port Pritz, or maybe not yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporting all things, Fols requested a sacrifice and a ceremony, and received a positive answer, so she exchanged 600 pounds of cash for the "Sheriff "Extraordinary characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take up the fist-like items of children consisting of iron black, dark red and silver, and look at the beautiful spiritual brilliance, and Fols is delighted again. It’s a sigh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s early to get the auxiliary materials, she will soon be promoted to the sequence 8...and I don’t know when to become a master of tricks "...I hope that Mr." will help me find the corresponding extraordinary materials as soon as possible...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh has been unconsciously playing the "arbitrator", but Don't worry about her digestion of the sequence 9 potion, but what should I do after becoming a "Sheriff?" Apply to Mr. "Footer" for a certain price in exchange for the "playing the law" teaching... or directly suggesting that she mix into the police force? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the mottled long table, Klein looked thick in front of him Cash, carefully counted several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this way, I have 1,230 pounds, and the difference of 300 pounds will be enough for the money needed for a sequence of 6 extraordinary materials, of course, 1500 pounds is only the bottom line price, the actual transaction is often more expensive than this...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where can I get the money from recently? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
