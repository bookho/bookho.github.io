			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sharing some interesting things and the anecdotes between the nobles, Audrey stopped the writing movements and put on a look of serious thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She relies on the excellent memory of the "audience", the fragmentary words of the Earl of Father Hall and occasional teaching, part of the news heard in the banquet, the ball and the salon They are sorted out and organized into paragraphs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making the draft, Audrey wrote the pen: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About the Baker you asked The political situation in Rand, this is not within my interest. I can only describe the details I have accidentally known to you by impression."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the previous paragraph At the time, my father told me that after the abolition of the Grains Act, the price of food has plummeted, and the rent standards for fields and pastures have also fallen off. The exact magnitude is not clear. I can only make you understand by an example." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, the Duke of Nigan is the aristocrat who has the most land outside the royal family. He claims to have more than 12 million pounds of fields, pastures and forests. Last year, he The rent of the rent has reached the highest level ever, 1.3 million pounds. This year, the total rent that can be foreseen is 850,000 pounds, which has reduced the full 450,000 gold pounds, which has exceeded all the assets I can share. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need more explanation, my dear Brother, you must understand the characteristics of most old-school aristocrats. They are proud of owning land, mainly renting land, and decently surpassing everything. Even if they are in debt, they must maintain a life that is sufficient to match their status. Castle repair costs, thousands of pounds of clothing and jewelry per year, as well as persevering hunting, social banquets, occasional grand weddings, extravagant funerals, etc., etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of the serious decline in rents, as far as I know, some nobles have financial difficulties. For this reason, Earl Wolfe sold 840,000 acres of land in the country and received 290,000 gold pounds. The viscount sold the collection of 55,000 gold pounds to the National Gallery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides a small number of powerful aristocrats have long shifted their focus to steel, In the coal, railway, banking, rubber and other industries, everyone else has suffered serious damages in this "grain bill" storm, let us praise our dear Hall Earl!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "My father told me that financial embarrassment will make the aristocrats' control over the party politics to the lower house seats decline. It is conceivable that the number of members of the land aristocrats will be reduced in the next year's change."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the Conservatives and the New Party promised no matter who they are, as long as they have no criminal record and donate enough money, they will seek for the other party, of course, The premise is that the gentleman has the lowest land area that matches the title. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One example is that the wealthy Mr. Sindras purchased the minimum of 600,000 acres of land needed for the Baron and then donated 10 to the Carlton Club. Wanjin Pound, donated 400,000 pounds to the Conservative Party, donated 300,000 pounds to charity activities, and finally succeeded in getting the title of His Majesty the King, becoming a distinguished baron. In this regard, I heard that there is a price list from the Baron. 300,000 pounds, the hereditary baron is 70 to 1 million pounds, the Viscount and the Earl have no clear answer, but I want to be sure enough exaggeration. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this year, many aristocrats with financial problems began to earnestly Considering the possibility of networking with wealthy businessmen, in just two months, there are three similar marriages, and the dowry of the woman is very coveted. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, the workers who marched to protest the Grain Act did get a reduction in food prices, but the quality of their lives did not improve, or even more. It was low, because the bankrupt farmers entered the city and robbed the work with low salary demands, so the wages of the working class fell rapidly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember that day, after talking about these things, my father asked me, who do you think is the winner of this "Corn Bill" incident? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Alfred, you must know the answer, and you can certainly rely on your own efforts to get a hereditary title." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde looked at the window in a mess, and the eyes were bright as if two flames were burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She keeps saying "450 pounds" as if she is mourning the mantra, and every time she reads it, she can gain courage and strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dakholm hasn’t come to us today, telling the recent investigation, let’s go to his house!” Suddenly, I’m looking around Fols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakholm is the leader of a gang in the eastern part of Beckland, controlling many beggars and thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is always a kind-hearted look, the mellow face always has a smile full of affinity, but Hugh knows that this is a cruel and vicious villain. He once stepped on the hand of a 13-year-old thief just because the other person had hidden the harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is not necessary, Hugh is not even willing to see Dakholm, but the other is one of the people who know the most hobo in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls will turn the brown hair of the micro-roll to the back of the ear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delayed my lunch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem! Maybe after this week, I will ask you to have an Intis meal!" Promised promise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do I have to thank God for this?" Foers asked a funny question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is different from Hugh, she is a shallow believer in the god of steam and machinery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, the two girls changed to another public carriage and went to the eastern part of Bakerland to find the home of Dakholm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a townhouse in a narrow alley with green plants on the walls and a messy environment outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take away to the door, raise your right hand, and tap the door a few times with a unique rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the door that was not closed was opened back with her knock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happiness and faint expression turned into seriousness, like a fried lion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled out the three-sided thorns that she carried with her, carefully pushing the door and slowly entering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fols also changed the state of carelessness, and I did not know where to find a dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t smell strange smells, but the rich experience made them keenly aware of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One step, two steps, three steps, Hugh and Fols entered the home of Dakholm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they saw the pale broken arm on the gas lamp, saw the heart, liver, spleen and lungs on the coffee table, and saw one after another flesh and blood on the floor. Hang on the coat rack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white bone is shaved very cleanly, and it is stacked in the right place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bones in the crowd, there is a head with empty eyes, it is Dakholm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sleek face still maintains a kind smile, it seems that everything is normal, and the interior of the house is not filled with bloody taste, and there is no trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a former clinic doctor, later best-selling author, sequence 9 extraordinary, Fols saw a more disgusting death scene than this, she took a picture Under the squatting, vomiting, and looking around, he looked around and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Qilingus?' Hurricane Lieutenant' Qilinger斯?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He found that Dirkholm was investigating the missing tramp, so he followed it back and went straight to the door?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or Dakholm found his whereabouts, but was he discovered?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s a pirate general known for being fierce and deceitful... and the difference here is also in line with the performance of his magical item.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Blackmail...” Buddha Ersi suddenly burst into tears and blurted out. "Would he still wait in the vicinity and try to ambush his main messenger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a break, immediately Slightly flustered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"very likely!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the sequence 6" The Wind Man is a big pirate who holds a magical item, and the two of them only have a sequence of 9! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very simple and easy comparison! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the house opposite Dakholm’s house, one has a unique wide chin The 30-year-old man with dark green eyes stood by the window, staring coldly at Hugh and Fols, pushing the door open and slowly entering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qilingus! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black gloves worn by his left palm suddenly squirmed like a living, with a dark gold-colored scales on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qilingus reveals a cruel and happy expression, and the dark green eyes become pale gold and ruthless erect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fols thought for a turn, busy pulling off to the other side, I avoided the area facing the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, as she bit her white teeth, she took off a string of bracelets covered by the ruffles of the cuffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three dark blue rough stones on the silver bracelet. The surface of the stone is filled with burning marks and uneven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folly tearing down a stone and shouting in ancient Hermes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“门!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She firmly grasped Hugh Dilcha, watching the stone bloom with an illusory light blue glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of the two ladies is blurred and close to invisible. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw something that was difficult to describe, even transparent, as if it did not exist, and saw one after another of different colors, with infinite knowledge. Guanghua, they entered the mysterious spiritual world, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that weird world above reality, Fols took a step in a certain direction . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three breaths, they got out of the state of transparency and illusion, returned to reality, and returned to Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they are not in the home of Dakholm, but an unmanned cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qilings with fine-sleeved gloves quietly appeared in Dak At the door of Holm, his eyes swept coldly inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stunned and frowned slightly, talking to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' Traveller's??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do next?" Fowles gasped and gasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bracelet is the magical item she got in the adventure of getting the apprenticeship formula and materials, except for the full moon every month. She heard some strange, vague slang and no other hidden dangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
