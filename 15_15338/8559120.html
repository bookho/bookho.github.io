			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The star above will" Jia Delia thinks and replies:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight 8 Point, number six."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, no delay... Kline’s margin is very small:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s just falling, the light in the crystal ball suddenly converges, and the figure wearing black classical robes is getting darker and darker. More and more blurred, and soon disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a crystal ball that has become very common, Klein turned his body, opened the door, and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss who leaned against the wall and sipped, he threw it and threw the crystal ball to the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the boss was busy picking up, Klein went down the stairs and left the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the "Wild Whale Dance", he took out the gold-shelled pocket watch, slammed the switch and looked at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s almost noon, most of the bars are open... Klein blocks a rental carriage and tells the other in Fossic that he is going to Lodal's Bar – This means “Dawn” in the local language, a relatively concentrated place for adventurers in the Gargas Islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Klein, the collection of different intelligence and the availability of various news is of great significance, which may help him at a critical moment. Make the most accurate judgment, thus escaping the misfortune of losing life, so even if he doesn't like the bar too much, he has to go often, have a beer full of wheat, sit quietly in the corner of the bar, listen to the people around him. Exchange interesting things and big events happening at sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, he also wanted to find out if Roy King, who was detained in the "general city" of the Governor’s House, was rescued - these two For many months, "The Mercury Snake" Will Anthony has never dreamed again. "Destiny Member" Ricciard also did not call the messenger to provide clues to powerful magical items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty minutes later, the carriage stopped and the "Rodar" bar, erected with a huge brand, appeared in front of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to take out 2 Sule notes and pay them to the coachman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the driver’s slightly rough face was seen, he suddenly remembered one thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is foreign, this is the colony of Fossac, has its own universal currency! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum is Gobi, followed by Silver, and then up to King Horn, they maintain a very human decimal, making conversion very easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgot to go to the bank to exchange Gobi and Essence... All of the previous ones were used in hotels and restaurants... Kline just wanted to see where there are banks around, The coachman was delighted to have taken the two 1 Sule banknotes and repeatedly checked them several times. The rough skin on his face was full of brilliance:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you, thank you for your generosity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold pounds, soler and pennies are also hard currency here? Well, the Gargas Islands are not too far away from Toskat and Olavi. Many items will be sold to these two places, and many Ron adventurers like to run to the "White Whale Sea". The currency of the Kingdom of Lun is indeed normal... Hehe, Lun’s industrial and economic strength is stronger than the Fossac Empire, and can even be said to be much stronger. The Golden Pound is much stronger than Jin Horn... and so on! Klein got out of the carriage and walked to the "Lodal" bar, thinking back to the driver's surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he remembered one thing, that is, 1 gold pound can be exchanged for 5.5 gold Horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, 2 Sule is worth 5.5 silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the "White City", the cost of renting a carriage for 1 hour is 4 sterling silver, less than 1 hour, in 1 hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huh... I vomited a little, and Klein pressed his hat and pushed the heavy wooden door into the "Lodal" bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, bars close to the dock or factory area often have lunch and dinner business, so it will open at around 11:00. The adventurer who was idle and okay gathered in front of the bar, asked for spirits, ordered smoked fish and soup with floating fat, and drank bread, and it was very enjoyable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, drink Lie Langqi and Nibos? Is this going to be drunk all day? This custom of Fossac is really unacceptable... Kline said a few words, walked to the bar with no expression, sat down to the corner and tapped the boardwalk:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Two slices of toasted sausage, a smoked whale meat, a thick soup, a glass of Glass beer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glass It is more popular on the east coast of Fossac and is not uncommon in the islands of Sunia and the Gargas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Newcomer?" The bartender looked up at Klein and said, "A total of 4 silver 6 kopecks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not drink spirits is new? Klein didn't pay attention to the other party's problem and directly lost 2 Sule notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This value is 5 silver 5 kopecks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it is now Gelman Sparrow, Kline strongly resisted the urge to let the other party find money, just give a tip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in Beckland’s bar, so much food is almost 2 Suler’s look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender who received the tip did not ask again, and poured a glass of Glass beer and pushed it to Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color of the beer is black, the foam is thick, the entrance is filled with aroma, and the mellowness is a little irritating, so Klein feels that the alcohol is high. Do you suspect that there is a strong drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When waiting for food, he sipped his drink and listened quietly to the adventurers around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the group’s topics are mostly focused on who and who have made a fortune, who is killed by the pirates, who who killed the pirate captain did not ask for a reward Turned over and took over the other party's subordinates, who and who had a illegitimate child with a female, and who did not perform well in the brothel, became a laughing stock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he used the chargian specialty soup made from beets, onions, cabbage, carrots, fish, cream, etc. to the front of Klein, he finally listened Something interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An adventurer presses down the voice, to the surrounding companions:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it heard? To the east of Gargas, there is a Quaternary relic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! Who found it?" His companion asked again and curiously. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurer looked around and didn’t care too much:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gareth Found, you know, he is a navigator who is good at diving.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was drunk, was blown off the deck by the storm, sinking into the sea, who I know that there are some wreckage of steel buildings, absolutely from the human steel construction! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then? "His companion asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurer smiled low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gareth Along the wreckage, I discovered a large abandoned abyss that did not know how deep it was. It was filled with sea water, but it still gave him a very deep and terrifying feeling. The storm was on, which may lead to the center of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said that there seems to be something in the call to him, he did not dare to explore, afraid to float to the surface."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep sea giant well...the strange "attractive" feeling...this is not necessarily the ruins of the Quaternary, perhaps the Tertiary, the Second Age, the little "Sun" has said In that dark era, the sea monsters surrendered to the elven king Sunia Solem, helping him to rule the seabed... sweet and sour slightly sour... Klein drank the soup, and forked the smoked beluga meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
