			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the question behind Bishop Electra, Klein had a preview, and sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It is my father, a real intelligent man, but unfortunately he died in an accident many years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he said this, he incorporated the feelings of the original parents when they died, the emotions they accumulated when they were unable to go home in a foreign land, and the traces of the experience in the city of Tingen. The tone seemed dull, with a little smile. However, there is a kind of sorrow that does not hurt the endless taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, he must have entered the Kingdom of God and sleep under the watchful eyes of the goddess." Bishop Electra said sincerely, and clocked four times on the chest. , painted a red moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't wait. Don Tess responded, he looked at each other and invited:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The day after tomorrow there is a moon mass for the dead to help them sleep in the kingdom of the goddess, to have eternal peace, do not know if you are interested in participating?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp There are not many Boxing Days in the Goddess of the Night, the most important of which is Winter Day, followed by the Great Mass at the full moon, also known as the Moon Mass, followed by the normal mass and prayer every Sunday, but different parishes The Cathedral has a special Boxing Day of its own because of its different guardian saints or angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is exactly what I want." Kline got up and said, sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows him to fully reach the pastors and bishops of the Church of St. Seychelles, and even to associate with the bishops of the parishes, to lay in and out of certain areas of the church. basis. At the same time, he once again felt why the "night" route was interchangeable with the "death" route: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both have the right to peace, sleep, darkness, etc., representing the end and end! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Morrie Macht did not start the topic of Dawn. Dontes’s identity, experience, etc., as if I just asked casually He and his wife, Liana, chatted about the experience of going to Desi Bay for the past few years. They had to supplement the relevant matters and lived there for two days. Klein responded with a copy of the indigenous tone, focusing on sharing. Desi special grilled fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, he pretended to inadvertently mention his own hunting activities when he went to West Bailang for business, and he seemed familiar with the primitive jungle there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is doing some of the necessary preparations for the second-level identity of Dawn Dontes, and West Byron and East Byron are different, Lun and Intis’ colonial power is quite different, there are often conflicts, and even the areas that are actually controlled change from time to time. It is not a simple matter to find the trajectory of a businessman or adventurer there, especially Dao’en. Tang Taisi may also use a pseudonym. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the hunting experience in the original jungle of West Byron, Klein was not randomly crafted, nor was he copied from any magazine, he Based on the glorious deeds mentioned by Anderson, the strongest hunter in the foggy sea, the details are taken, the backbone is abandoned, and the self-deductive is made, which is both real and false. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear the thick python in the jungle, the cannibal fish can capture the flowers of the prey, and Mrs. Mahat’s wife, Liana, sends out from time to time. Amazing, a pair of fear and want to continue to understand, and the members of the parliament and the bishop are also very interested, always can not help but interrupt the description of Dawn. Dontes, ask for some details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are such a great hunter! When I was serving in East Byron, I never had a chance to enter the jungle. I didn't expect it to be so dangerous." After the graceful middle-aged gentleman finished, Morrie Maht picked up a small piece of velvet cake and sincerely praised, "If there is a chance, I would like to invite you to hunt together."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of their conversation, the maid has sent afternoon tea snacks, and a male servant is responsible for serving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the invitation of Mr. Maht’s half-truth, Klein responded with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I can't wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the bishops, parliamentarians, and lawmakers, the smile on Klein’s face faded a little, but it did not disappear completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is satisfied with the progress of the present, and the Bishop of Elektra is connected with the Church of the Night God, the main purpose of his return to Beckland. Mr. Mahat is a veteran soldier. The current member of Parliament is undoubtedly belonging to one or a few officer clubs, which will help him to continue investigating the Bakerland smog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is to deepen the contact... Klein returned to the small living room and saw that the maid had taken away the remaining snacks and black tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intended to eat a little more...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-No matter what other foods, Lu Well, especially Beckland's dessert snacks are quite outstanding, and the chef that Dawn Dontes invited was especially good at this field. Even Mrs. Liana just praised it, Klein also I deeply agree with it in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting his eyes, Klein did not speak, and walked calmly toward the stairs leading to the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before dinner, the butler Walter finally returned home and reported to him about the 10% stake in the Beckland Bike Company:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. We are fortunate enough to have hired professional lawyers and accountants to investigate the situation of the Beckland Bike Company and provided the seller with a quote before the advertisement was published, but in the follow-up negotiations There is a buyer with higher bids, he can't continue, he can only give up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this way, we don't have to wait for the investigation report, we can directly hire the original one. team. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded and asked without cover: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it now?" The price? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The buyer who gave up the bid was 6,000 pounds, and the psychological bottom line was 7,000 pounds. In addition, the buyer did not disclose the seller, but from various aspects. The feedback from the news, at least 8,000 pounds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8000 pounds, not bad... Do you want to raise another hand? If I add a little price here, the other party will give up directly, isn’t it very?尴尬? Klein gently sighs: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You give me the corresponding report, I think about it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the report, using dinner, in order to erect a broad but savvy image of the hard-working faction, Klein sideways to Richardson:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare the two-wheeled carriage, I have to go out for a trip. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that Richardson would wonder why it was a two-wheeled carriage, which was not decent enough. Who knows that this close-fitting man just flashed a trace?" Responsible and replied: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, sir. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the order, don't ask why, this is an advantage... Klein secretly sighed, waiting for Richardson to come back and help him put on his coat .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the two-wheeled carriage, he directly ordered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to Beckland Bridge The area and the eastern edge turn around. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richardson still did not ask for the purpose, just let the driver carefully control the horse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carriage Crossing the Jowood area, under the light of a gas street lamp, arrived at the Beckland Bridge area.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not say where to go, just let the driver Traveling freely in the nearby streets.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned against the wall and looked out to the street, seeing a pedestrian’s clothing was worn out and his face was tired Walking, it seems that I just finished the day's busy, I am rushing home to have dinner. Occasionally, there will be a ringing bicycle passing by, and rushing to the distance. The rider's expression is more energetic and more attractive than the pedestrian. An unspeakable pride.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
