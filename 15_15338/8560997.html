Klein repeated the other’s answer in his heart and turned the topic to the flag and White Rose War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few chats, he politely sang, and with the butler Walter, the personal maid Richardson, went to other showcases and continued their visit, it seems The encounter just happened is only a trivial matter, and it is an occasional exchange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near noon, returning to the high-end four-wheeled carriage, Klein looked at the bicycle passing by, and suddenly said:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Walter, do you seem to know Mr. William Sykes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter nodded seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw him when I was at the home of the Conrad family.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He serves a royal family Member, former Earl of Rastin, Prince Edsac. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not make any concealment, and introduced the history of William Sykes in detail.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Served Prince Edsack? After the prince died in the smog of Beckland, he actually did a good job. I don’t know which deacon to serve as a manor... Maybe he knows some secrets? Klein gently decapitated and asked no more, but he wondered if he would like to find an opportunity to investigate William Sykes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If William Sykes really Knowing what, the faction of the royal family will not leave it, or he belongs to that faction. In short, investigating him will be a very dangerous thing, and there is no way to entrust Miss Magic, Emlin White. Or Miss Hugh did it... Miss Sharon’s ability is enough, but it is likely to cause her current safe life to be destroyed... The best way is to go to the Grand Theft Auto "Black Emperor", but the problem is that stealing to Antioch Before the Gonos family’s notes, I’m investigating the Bakerland’s smog incident, hope It's limited to the outside, it doesn't alarm anyone, it doesn't bring unexpected changes... Kline seems to calmly admire the streetscape outside the window, and there are many thoughts in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the end, he decided to be patient and not want to destroy the most important things at the moment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used lunch, slept, Klein accepted literary appreciation Education until the evening.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending the tutor, he was going to the second floor restaurant and suddenly heard the doorbell being rattled.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sound of Dangdang, Klein looked at Richardson, the close-fitting servant immediately stepped forward and opened the door.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two police officers wearing black and white uniforms. They can be seen from their epaulettes. One is a senior inspector and the other is a sheriff.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police, is there anything? Richardson asked the employer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior inspector was a tall, thin man with black hair hidden under his hat, only the corners of the color, he I swept the house and gave a gentle smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I came to find Mr. Don Tae, a case involving him and his butler. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What case? Klein walked slowly toward the door. "I am Dawn. Dontes." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing his introduction, he politely said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two police officers, don't know How do you call you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If things are more troublesome and take longer, it is better to go to my reception room and have a cup of tea while talking."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another police officer, that is, the sheriff, is a very British lady. She is obviously a little bit moving, looking at the senior inspector next to her, waiting for the boss’s decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Because of the relationship between the Church of the Night God, there are a lot of female police officers in the Lun police system, but because of the influence of other beliefs, social thoughts, etc. They are still subject to a certain degree of discrimination in promotion and post, most of them are mainly internal clerks, and there are invisible ceilings in the rising space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to drink tea, but we have to ask your servants at home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and finally got to the point:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dr. Don Tae, do you know William Sykes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This morning at the Kingdom Museum I know.” Klein vaguely felt that something had changed unexpectedly and asked on his own initiative, “What happened to him?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior inspector Collapse the smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He died and died in a hotel near the Kingdom Museum."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Dead?" Klein did not hide his surprise and surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just met him, he died? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has long been eyeing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior inspector seriously nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the cause of death is more complicated and does not rule out being The possibility of murder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His female companion?" Klein frowned. "When I met him, he had a female companion." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lady is his mistress. When she left the hotel, William Sykes was still alive, and the hotel waiter could be sure because they later There is a red wine in the past.” The senior inspector briefly introduced the situation. “Where did you go after leaving the Kingdom Museum?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I went back directly here, Lunch, sleep, and class, my servant, my neighbor, my literary appreciation teacher, can prove this.” Kline answered calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately turned his head to Richardson:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to Walter. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the butler Walter walked down the second floor with white gloves and answered the same question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two police officers, after obtaining the consent of Dawne Dontes, asked the servants such as Richardson and found no problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t stop, politely left, and visited the neighbors around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was not affected by this matter, went up to the second floor and enjoyed dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time after the fast reading in the leisurely reading newspaper, before going to sleep, Klein looked out the window at night, waiting for the close-servant Richardson to receive Take the fruit in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he did not turn his head and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Walter did what in the afternoon? Things?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Always working on various issues, not leaving.” Richardson whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gently decapitated, no more questions, a little doubt whether he thought too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... He sighed slowly, went to the bed, and lay down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep in the middle of the night, Klein’s spirituality suddenly touched, and the whole person woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flicked his brow, got up and left the bed, walked to the window, and opened the curtain with a gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the faint moonlight, in the deep night, a figure walked carefully from the garden path to the side of the wall and turned it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a wide forehead, black hair and a serious brown sable, which is the steward Walter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agile, smooth, not a well-trained person, a low-sequence extraordinary person..." Klein looked at the scene and made a preliminary in his heart. Judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are everyone so skilled in climbing down the waterway? In the late night, Mr. Guan Jia should have never done it, otherwise my spirituality will definitely have an early warning. After all, it is leaving from my "territory"... This shows that he is in other places, and often has a similarity before becoming my steward. Action... Klein whispered his mouth and returned to the bed, taking out the iron cigarette case from the pillow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to manipulate the "resentment" Senol, track the butler Walter, and see what the other party is doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope not to exceed 100 meters, otherwise I have to enter the sewer... Klein silently, back to the curtain gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His secret agent Seignor immediately jumped to the gas streetlight next to the sewer entrance with the mysterious connection between the mirrors, then penetrated the manhole cover and silently followed . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw Walter a ten-meter-long walk and turned to a more secluded and gloomy passage with mossy and dirty things on the wall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the housekeeper stopped and didn’t know who to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So impulsive?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not wait for a better chance? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, a female voice that was slightly hoarse due to weakness responded to Walter's question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is the best opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When he returns to the manor, I don't know how long it will come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But why are you still suffering from such a serious injury?" Walter said with a bit of worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl screamed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"William Sykes than you, also better than me Imagined stronger, probably only in this way, in line with his secret identity.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, I finally got a clue from him, for so long. In the past, there was finally an opportunity to get close to the truth. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to be so anxious." Walter silenced the next way.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weak female voice gave a low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I have sold the soul to the evil spirit, and the only meaning in life is revenge." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter sighed a little: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You continue to hide here, I will prepare food for you until you recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is an accident, contact me by old means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weak female voice For a long time: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When he was alive, there were many subordinates who claimed to be loyal. After he died, only a few people still remember him and would like to take risks for him. "You are the most unexpected to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was the first aristocrat to treat me like that, and I really want to be loyal." Walter Low response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein who used the secret to hear these conversations vaguely understood the truth of the matter:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the death of Prince Edessack, a few people who were loyal to him secretly investigated the truth about his suicide. Walter was one of them. However, he was mainly responsible for the intelligence gathering on the bright side and using his identity to provide some relief... This should be the extra expansion of the "Magic Mirror" Arrods...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately let the "resentment" Senigal hide his body shape Diving into the secluded and hidden passage, I saw Walter standing sideways and talking to people, and in the half-blocked place, a woman in a black dress sat against the wall, her face pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman listened to Walter’s words and laughed in her throat, looking out at the exit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
