The fat pharmacist, known as Dakwell, was shocked and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owl eyes squinted at the front:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have noticed that he walked in After seeing you, I obviously stayed for two seconds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I feel that this is not in line with the image of his pharmacist?" Fat pharmacist . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owl wings open and fall:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to think so, I have no way "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What books have you read recently?" The fat pharmacist's face was fleshy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owl replies seriously and seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My reading bias depends on you The level of knowledge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a pity that the words you can teach me are only so few, I have to read popular novels with low vocabulary requirements. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, this is serialized in the newspaper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat Pharmacist Dirkwell Hearing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will wait for a recipe to come back and call it the "East Byron Bird Cooking Guide.""<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting for the owl to say, he sinks his face and says to himself: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He knows me? He looks like a standard The Luen people, at least more than half of the Lun lineage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have spent several cities in Lun with pseudonyms, it is not surprising that some people know, but still I have to be vigilant. If there is no news from the old man before March, I have to leave here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he turned his head and looked over his shoulder. The owl looks at it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sometimes, you are still very useful. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, your eyes, your body movements tell me, the real thought in your heart is, damn, I obviously want one to help me. The monsters deal with the gangster's pets. According to the dragon's standard, they collected the potion formula and extraordinary materials. As a result, they got a stupid bird who only knew to read the newspaper and watch the drama. Damn, I can't wait to bottle it again! "The owl is like a parrot, and it is played with a fat pharmacist's accent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat pharmacist Dirkwell's expression is stiff for a few seconds, smirk :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know it, silly bird! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it weren't for me that I had the ability to 'tamer", you couldn't take a bottle of potion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the herbal shop, one person and one animal are simultaneously silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the owl pretends that nothing has happened:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kewell, is this really useful? You have commissioned dozens of adventurers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not good at finding people, I can only entrust them, Moreover, you must really find, or confirm the whereabouts of the old man, I will pay, a penny will not spend more!" Fat pharmacist said, immediately sighed, "The old man always claims to be the winner of the lucky and fate, There should be nothing going on..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These things come out Will the pharmacy really work?” Returning to the carriage of the “Azure Wind” hotel, Daniz looked at Klein’s paper bag next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are black herbs, grotesque shells and flowers of different colors, which are always unreliable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You haven't drunk yet..." Daniz subconsciously retorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the fat pharmacist, although his mouth is stinky and poisonous, but his heart is still relatively kind... and Captain Allan also thinks his The pharmacy was effective enough... As a German Sparrow, Klein did not respond to Daniz’s doubts, picked up the paper bag and lost it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without words, Daniz understands that the guy across the street means that you come to pick up the medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he has recently become accustomed to doing similar things, and there is no impulse to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the "Azure Wind" hotel, Klein found a chair to sit down and watched Daniz lit the fireplace, hoisted the clay pot, added water and herbs . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backward, Klein felt his head dizzy, the whole person was very tired, and seemed to sleep at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to get rid of the pharmacy and solve the problem as soon as possible, he forcibly thinks about various problems to overcome the trap:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think carefully, and this battle with 'Disease Lieutenant', if it wasn't for my surprise attack, I would suppress her from the beginning, so that she could never enter the rhythm she was best at, until the end I have the opportunity to hide the distance, I may not be her opponent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The combination of stealth and disease is really a BUG, ​​and then with the assassin A fatal blow, happy containment interference, really want to fight can not find, want to run can not run, can only watch their body gradually weak, infected with various diseases, even be charmed by the other side, give up resistance... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this respect, each sequence 5 is very strong, it is close to the level of the demigod, and on the other hand is the 'squirming hunger' There are obvious defects in the combination of these abilities, far from being comprehensive and without shortcomings.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Well, the ability of the 'Divination' route sequence 5 'The Secret Master' is very restrained...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Recently, I can help the fat pharmacist find his teacher. However, under the premise of insufficient information and almost only photos, I can only take chances and see when I have a clue. After all, I am not a god, I can't find someone out of thin air...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, in a sense, I am really God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can let the believers of 'Poseidon' help find it, as long as the old gentleman named Roy Kim came to Baiam, he will always meet Who, who has seen it, and most of the indigenous people secretly believe in 'Poseidon'... This is called the vast ocean of the people...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, before Captain Airland left Baiam, let him introduce the military liaison personnel for me. If there is any news, I can ask them for reimbursement. By the way, check the ship passengers registered in the past few months. See if there is Roy Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is another way, the radio ticker has been on the fog for some time, and you should be able to contact the mirror Arodus. I originally planned to ask Elaine's whereabouts. Now I don't need to find another redhead lady. I can change it to Roy. Kim.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, a lot of adventures. There is no such thing as a home, and I have three ways to find someone! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of thoughts, and Klein finally found the success of the pharmacy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he looked at the bottle of dark green liquid that Daniz took, he hesitated for two seconds, or reached out and grabbed it.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein suddenly felt that his throat was burning, his face was red.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds him of the taste of perverted spicy in his life.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, his whole person wakes up, blocked The nose is fast and smooth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜咕噜... He barely finished drinking, and there is an illusion that the disease is half full.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, he completely healed and there was no doubt about the ability of the "pharmacist". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder the name of the potion is called "pharmacist"... Klein put on a hat, left the hotel with Daniz, and went out to Baiyam in the night. Come to the hidden private harbor hidden on the other side of the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight, the "Golden Dream" will provide assistance to the Resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After some coordination and tossing, Daniz used the "Lingling Ceremony" to contact "Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the ship was always cleaned, and the ships with strange main guns entered the private port, depicting huge canvases. There are five kinds of gold coins, which are Lun's Golden Pound, Fossack's Golden Horn, Intis's Fairkin, Fenetport's Kinriso, and Rinburg's Sassenkin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the banner of the "Golden Dream" and a symbol of this pirate group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still not professional enough, if it is me, it will add Ma Xi’s Porter Gold, Segal’s Zloty, the Bailang Empire’s pattern gold coins, etc. Wait... Kline is standing next to him, with his hands in his pockets, watching Edwina Edwards appear in the bow. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, she wore a hunter's hat, wearing a waisted rider's shirt and a black jacket, which is very consistent with the image of the female pirate general in the rebel army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her usual dress will only make people think that it is a tutor... Klein swears, take a few steps back, let Daniz run around, After busy, busy. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the hard work of the big pirate with a bounty of 5,500 pounds, a batch of food and cloth was sent to the rebels and other rebel forces, and the transaction came to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi quietly took a breath and came to Klein to make a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Nothing else?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I go back to the 'Golden Dream'? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, what is your employment fee for these few days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's just me In the sense that your captain is looking for an excuse, in a sense, this grain and cloth is my reward... Klein nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your The captain has paid.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can go back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? "Daniz couldn't believe it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although "Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina is not far behind, he is still afraid of Geer. Man Sparrow is suddenly going crazy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not respond to him, turned his body and went straight to the path of leaving the private port.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi silently exhaled, endured the excitement, and quickly ran back to the "Golden Dream".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time the ship was far away in the night, the private port belonging to the Rebels was getting smaller and smaller, and he was truly convinced that he had returned to the "Golden Dream".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At this moment, he only felt that there were too many things in the past half-month. This unprecedented stimulation is like a wonderful dream.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, a sailor came close and curiously asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Head, 'Iron' McVetti is really killing you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz suddenly laughed and sneaked at the captain Edwina next to him, and the opponent went down:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this matter, I made an important contribution, we said while drinking! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark sea, the "Golden Dream" goes farther and farther.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... .........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the "Azure Wind" hotel, Klein was about to fall asleep and suddenly saw the surrounding colors become very vivid.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
