			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The synonym of war... The similar sequence of the witch route... Which one would it be? Klein looked at the holographic film-like scene and thought about the sequences he knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he is only a full member of the night, many materials are still inaccessible, and the name and corresponding features of the medium and high sequence are almost black and white, just knowing from the "eternal "The priest of light" and "no darkness" from the sneak peek, "Dawn Knight", "Guardian", "Hunter", and the "God of War" from the "Sun" juvenile mouth Dai Li and Deng En revealed the "Dead mentors" and "gatekeepers." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it is difficult for him to accurately determine whether a sequence of pathways is synonymous with war. He can only take exclusions. For example, the "God of War" approach does not look like war. It is a single battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Klein narrowed the scope to five:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is the ruler of the Kingdom of Lun The "arbitrator" sequence shared by the Augustus family and the Castilla family of the Fenett Kingdom, but Klein feels that this is the smallest possible because the "arbitrator" corresponds to the sequence 8 "Sheriff" Sequence 7 is the "interrogator" and appears to be going to trial and adjudication, not the direction of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the avenue represented by the "Black Emperor" of the Solomon Empire. The modern name of Sequence 9 is "lawyer", which is good at discovering and using rules. Vulnerabilities and weak opponents, with excellent eloquence and speculative logic, this is the second lowest possible path for Klein. He suspects that the development of this sequence is to use rules and walk in the shadow of order. Of course, war is also an order. One of the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is the Einhorn family of the rulers of the Fossac Empire, the former royal family of the Sorens of the Republic of Intis, and the secrets that have only appeared in the last two or three hundred years. Organizing the "Iron Blood Cross" and mastering the "hunter" approach, Klein believes that it may be quite high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internal information of the night hunter is described as "the hunter", the excellent tracker, the outstanding trap expert, the outstanding hunter, the name of the corresponding sequence 8 is "Provocate", sequence 7 is "arsonist", which has a certain connection with killing and war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four is the "criminal" approach that is followed by the devil's ancient organization "Bai Xuejiao". From the serial name, Klein feels it is not small. may. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth is the "Prisoner" approach in the hands of the "Rose School", known for its bloody sacrifices. The reason is the same as the previous one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein’s thoughts diverged, the scene changed again. Mrs. Shelen’s bath was just finished, her hair was wet, and her face was fresh and tempting. The charm of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I couldn’t see the look of the white robe woman who led Mrs. Shelen to become a witch... It should be that my psychic ability is not enough..." Klein Take back your mind and return your attention to your eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Xue Lun licked her hair and seemed to have drops of water falling from her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the man waiting in bed, snickering:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Need me to help Do you solve Maynard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man on the bed frowned and said: "Unless you can guarantee not to leave a trace, it is impossible And, what can you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this gentleman, Klein first stunned and immediately felt that he was expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The photograph of the middle-aged man often appears in the first edition of the newspapers such as the "Tingen City Laoshiren", who is the current mayor who is seeking re-election. Conservative party member. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Xue Lun smiled and did not go deep into this topic, the nightdress faded, and the beautiful looming walk to the bedside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenes changed one after another, and Klein saw a lot of members, businessmen and government employees who appeared in the newspapers of the city from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may discuss how to collect donations, or communicate how to bypass the Campaign Act to bribe voters, or promise to protect and solve problems, where Mrs. Shelen plays The role of "hacker". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the psychic, he confirmed that none of the guys in the upper circles of Tingen knew the true identity of Mrs. Shelen and did not actively cooperate with her to murder Maynard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Mr. Maynard’s death is Mrs. Shelen’s self-assertion? Why is she doing this, she does not need to take risks? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, from the perspective of Mrs. Shelen, she has the extraordinary ability to interfere with divination, and can create a love-like death without any problems on the surface, solve Mena Mr. Dee is not too risky and easy to expose his own affairs. However, her motives are obviously insufficient, and she is not in harmony with the risks that need to be taken, and does not match! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the need for her to "play"? But she can completely find a target that is not so sensitive to her status. In this way, the case will not require the assistance of a night servant, a punitive person, or a mechanical heart member. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more importantly, Mrs. Shelen should be able to see that Mayn’s wife hates her, full of unwilling emotions, not too small Maybe someone is looking for her, so why don't she transfer sensitive items such as the bones of the bones in advance, such as burying them somewhere in the garden? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is so confident in the safe, on the mezzanine, and the corresponding arrangement? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In doubt, Klein saw that the spirit of Mrs. Shelen had not dissipated significantly, and she had done another "dream divination". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of his divination this time is:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Xue Lun kills John Mena The real motive of Germany."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After meditation, Klein once again entered the dream and saw the new scene again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Shelen was carrying a glass of red wine, wearing a loose nightdress, and pacing back and forth in the room. Eventually, she drank the remaining liquor and seemed to have made up her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene quickly dissipated, and Klein became more confused, because the death of Mr. Maynard seemed to be the one that Mrs. Shelen volunteered to do, and was not instigated by anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Weird..." Klein secretly tried it, and tried it again with other divination statements. The answer was no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Mrs. Shelen’s gradual transparency, constant illusion, is about to disappear, Klein thought about it and made the final psychic:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sequence of the magic potion recipe for the witch route."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sequence of the magic potion recipe for the witch route."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein silently recited the new divination statement, and with meditation, quickly entered the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t want to do this divination because he thought that the “witch” approach was a type of disaster that caused pain, even if he got the corresponding potion formula, he also Not willing to sell to others, acting as an indirect murderer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he thought of the previous thing in a blink of an eye: he doubted and confirmed Dast Goodrich by understanding the "audience" potion formula Ann is a member of the psychological alchemy club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in order to better deal with the witches in the future, it is essential to understand the characteristics of their sequence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, after Hood Eugen’s death, Dast Goodrich has not contacted me, it should be a more powerful member of the psychological alchemy. When he did the investigation, he did not dare to take any action... When the idea flashed, Klein once again saw the deep hall and saw the woman in white holy robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Shelen’s head is low, she can only see each other’s legs, a pair of flawless legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, she heard a beautiful voice like a song:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Happy,' This is the name of the sequence 6 potion and the target you are about to promote. If you succeed, you are the 'happy witch'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as the promotion is completed, in addition to the ability of all aspects of the 'Witches' to be improved, you will become more beautiful, good at charm, good at the joy of the opposite sex or the same sex in love, you can make strange silk like a spider And make the most of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in front of Mrs. Shelen, there was an old book made of silver, which was spread out and written on the side of the recipe. Putting the material:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Main material: a pair of eyes of the enchanting banshee, one of the silk glands of the adult widow spider."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Auxiliary materials: 100 ml of pure water, 5 drops of black mandala juice, all the hair of the enchanting banshee, 10 grams of powder from Fernetport fly, real mummies 5 grams of ashes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture has changed again, the same deep hall, the same white robes with a high opening on the side of the skirt, and the same looks are not seen. Woman, but the difference is that Mrs. Shelen changed back to the original appearance and changed back to the photo. Young man on the tablet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wonderful female voice echoes into the ear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the name of the sequence 7 potion, I I am sure you are surprised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I can't believe it's called 'Witches'!" "Mrs. Xuelun" said with a little excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You remember, we must be closer to the 'original', we must be more and more like Him, He is a woman, we are also women." That wonderful The female replied, "You either give up or can only accept. After becoming a witch, you will become a real woman, and you will gain a great improvement in looks and charm. You will have the ability to invisible and use substitutes, you will master All kinds of dark magic, good at disturbing others' divination, and getting the black flame and frost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main material is: the whole blood of the black magic fish, The eggs of the agate peacock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The auxiliary materials are: 80 ml of pure water, 5 drops of golden mandala juice, three scales of shadow lizards, daffodil juice 10 drops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scene flashed, Klein saw "teaching "The recipe", saw the "Assassin" formula, and understood their corresponding characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he wanted to continue divination, Mrs. Schellen’s spirit completely dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exit the ceremony, return to reality, Klein packs up the materials, lifts the wall of spirituality, and tells Dunn all the secrets of the psychic. Smith then expressed his doubts about the murder of Mrs. Maynard by Mrs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Happiness' does not need to kill people with higher status and status... Well, we have to check where Mrs. Shelen has been in these years. Find out the true origins of her, find the deep hall you see, of course, this needs to be reported to the church, they are arranged in a unified manner, we can not leave Tingen at will." Dunn gently beheaded, looking around the circle, "You go to the first floor and check if the servants are still asleep. If someone wakes up and finds the movement here, he will bring him over and sign a confidentiality treaty according to the process. I am in charge of the second floor."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has turned over the black cloth and covered the seal "3—0271"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear this sentence Klein suddenly stunned and finally understood why the fierce battle had not allowed the servants and the attendants to come because the captain had put them into a state of slumber at the very beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s body still has some cold and stiffness, he can only slow down and move very lightly and slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing through the bedroom door, he reached out and pulled out the two tarot cards embedded in it, wiped it, and reloaded it into the pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the room, he walked up the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps, he suddenly thought of a problem, that is, how to confirm that the other person is asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try one by one with divination? Very troublesome... The captain is a "nightmare" and an expert in this area. I have to ask him if there is a quick and concise way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
