			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan and Tallim each left the Craig Club after filling out the recommendation form. Today is not a weekend. They have two operations in one afternoon, one It is necessary to teach the younger son of Conord, the equestrian, to ensure that the younger adult will not be embarrassed in the Beckland social season in the second half of the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the red vest servant and the beautiful maid of the dress to go back and forth several times, finally waiting for his own membership certificate and an inscription Badge with hoarfrost sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The entrance fee is 50 pounds, there are three and a half months left this year, and the annual fee is 4 pounds." The male servant wearing the red vest pushed the two things to Klein. before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took out 57 pounds of cash from Mary Gale and counted 54 pounds for each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount outside the membership fee and the annual fee is the first payment that Mary gave. She quickly figured out that Klain’s Dorag Gale’s I was very satisfied with who the mistress was and took the photo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50 pounds of membership...Mrs. Mary is really a generous lady! Klein looked at the man and the maid to verify the authenticity of the banknotes, confirmed the specific number, and thought of the private introduction of Starling Summer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mary's father is the co-founder of Coim, which owns 20% of the shares. Originally it was just a small company that barely made a little money, but with the increasing pollution of Beckland, anthracite and charcoal The demand for the company has increased, and the company has grown rapidly and become a large company in the capital region that can rank in the top ten. Mary's net worth has skyrocketed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is that she is married to Dorrag Gale, the company is still in a stage of no fame, her father used the shares as a dowry I didn’t care too much about it. I didn’t carry out “property protection”, but adopted the more popular “testament rebate” method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former refers to the dowry as an independent, separate woman’s property. The ownership does not belong to the man. Even the right to use depends on the mood of the woman. The latter is The dowry is attributed to the whole family, but the man must establish a valid will and promise to give priority to paying the wife equal to two to four times the dowry's rights when he separates the remaining property after his partner's death, and then according to the normal inheritance law. Carry out, this can effectively guarantee the life of the will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mary sue for divorce before getting evidence of Dorrag’s betrayal of marriage, then Coim’s shares will be split equally between the two parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein remembers that Stalin was very envious at the time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only this The current value of the shares is close to 20,000 gold pounds. Coupled with other properties, Mary is a truly wealthy woman. Once divorced, she will definitely be the target of many men of Beckland, including some nobles. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This money is only enough for Miss Justice to assassinate Ambassador Baker Lang twice... Klein suddenly associates and sees the red vest male servant and looks good. The maid gave herself a gift:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moriarty, welcome to join the Craig Club."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Klein picked up the membership certificate and the hoarfrost badge in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is made of hard-flexible hard paper, like a card with the name of Klein and the date of membership. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After pressing the mark on the index finger, this membership certificate is officially usable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter is the unique badge of the Cragg Club. It was named after its establishment in early November, corresponding to the hoarfrost constellation, with the symbol and "192" on the front. This number is followed by the inscription "Sherlock. Moriarty". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The club now has 192 members?" Klein asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, our club does not accept people without recommendations." The red vest male servant smiled and said, "The first floor has a cafeteria, bar, library. , squash court, conference hall, card room, you can use it for free, food and drinks can also be tasted free of charge, there are 16 lounges on the second floor, two small conference halls, the same free, as long as there is room to use." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good-looking maid points to the rear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There are two tennis courts on the lawn, completely free. There are two shooting range in the ground, you only pay at the price of the equipment rental.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If you Dissatisfied with the simple buffet, you can order your own food, we have a dedicated chef, you only pay for the materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Package, wrap, pack play ... is a high-end club... Klein sincerely thanked Mrs. Mary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You send someone to take me a turn, familiar with Environment, then give me a nap in the lounge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." The red vest male servant made the gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting acquainted with the environment of the Craig Club, Klein entered the lounge, carefully studied the pattern here and found that the hotel room is close to the next generation, it is said that Inti Style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to consider how to get the evidence of Dora’s extramarital affairs tomorrow, the flash of the camera can’t be concealed...that is, there is only one photo opportunity. ...and so, it will definitely be driven out of the club... Consider a safe way... Wait until you turn the newspaper and try to judge the progress of the Ian incident from the news to determine which three days of protection... Klein paced back and forth and fell into thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he suddenly felt guilty and the whole person became tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the premonition of the "clown"? But there is nothing in my mind... Klein only feels that the air around it has become condensed, and there are storms brewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, this feeling disappeared, as if nothing had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it dangerous to come? However, when I was attacked by Mersau, there was no similar situation... Klein puzzled and found a coin, and whether he would be attacked in recent days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought for a few seconds, Klein pulled the curtains, pretended to take a nap, and took four steps back and entered the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat down and thought for a long time, whispering silently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In recent days I There will be great danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; repeated mourning, he pops up again The coin, seeing the brass color, rolled down and fell to his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the king’s head is facing up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My reaction was really a sign of danger coming... Klein blinked slightly and leaned back against the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is quite puzzled about this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the "divination" or the "clown", it has never shown similar abilities before, even if the danger can be foreseen, because the goal is in front of you, just next to! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is near me... From the misunderstanding of my divination results, this matter definitely involves a higher sequence, very likely It was Becker's assistant... As a result, it inspired my prediction? This is unscientific, the amount, this is not occult... There are still some other factors hidden in it, but I still can't figure it out... Klein looks around, sees the fog, the deep red and the quiet, the palace is not old. Become so arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He converges on doubts, and temporarily ignores why, focusing on the attacks that will occur.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And divination several times, Klein found that he can only confirm that there will be great danger in the last few days, can not be shortened to three days, two days, or five hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, he can only get a vague revelation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the dream divination, he saw Ian, Ian in an old coat, he stood on the street, behind the elegant gas street lights and blurred Red moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
