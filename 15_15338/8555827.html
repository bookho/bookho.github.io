			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 8 pm, Harvest Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the normal attire, Klein took a look at the edge of the top hat and quietly looked around, then walked into the hall and walked to the right three rows of candlelights. Former Emlin White. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire has a black suitcase at his feet, and its surface seems to be covered with a layer of "spiritual wall." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed that Sherlock Morietti came in, and Emlin was first happy, and immediately showed a vigilant look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bent down to take the suitcase and stepped back a little further, closer to the priest Utlavsky who was concentrating on prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is afraid that I will grab extraordinary materials... Klein stopped at three meters and smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "First let me verify if it's the two materials I need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White extended his hand to comb the hair The box was lifted to the chest, and a slamming sound was released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Wall of Spirituality" was broken and turned into a light breeze through the prayer hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who had long since opened the vision, immediately saw the strange and splendid light, which is the spiritual brilliance of many extraordinary features. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two small boxes in the suitcase, one made of white tin, many patterns, simple and heavy, and one is a pure carton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin held a black suitcase with one hand and opened a silver-white but slightly dim tin box with the contents of the walnut peeling off the shell. Yellow-brown, with raised lines and depressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the candle sways, it changes shape, sometimes gray, grows wrinkles, sometimes dark brown, smooth and extremely, sometimes mixed with two colors, outline There are no "faces" of facial features. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he saw it, Klein felt that he had completely digested the power of the potion that was integrated into his own, just like the magnet suffered a different kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He controlled the body with the ability of the "clown" and suppressed the feeling of mutual attraction. He already understood that it was the authentic thousand-faced hunter brain. Department variant pituitary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Russell’s speculation in the diary is indeed possible, and the high-order items of the same route will intermittently and unconsciously attract the extraordinary of the low- and medium-order sequences. Come to its vicinity, and have a tendency to converge with each other... Although the brains of the Thousand-faced Hunters are far away from the high sequence, there is no such wonderful attraction, but the extraordinary characteristics of their own enrichment. Already enough, plus I also digested the potion of sequence 7, and the two showed similar signs when they were close enough...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I have not noticed before. First, the corresponding extraordinary materials have low grades. Second, their own strength is poor, and the sequence is not enough. Yes, every time I have finished the potion, there seems to be an illusory starry sky around me. There are so many embarrassing things that they are pulling each other and trying to get close to each other... This may be the picture of the "aggregation" law of extraordinary characteristics in the same way, and the greater the "quality", the stronger the gravitation...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, similar roads Will extraordinary characteristics conform to this law? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s expression reminiscent of the record in Russell’s diary, and combined with his own experience of digesting the potions three times, roughly defined a certain law. presence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White looked at him with a sneak peek, quickly closing the tin box and uncovering the carton next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the carton is covered with dense cotton, and a glass bottle with 200 ml of liquid is lying in the center, half of which is empty, and the rest is flowing. Modify the viscous water of your own color as the light changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there still a problem?" Emlin closed the carton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will confirm it again." Klein pulled out a gold coin and let it spin and jump between the fingers, as if he had his own life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;铮! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold coin bounced and fell again, spreading over Klein’s palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the portrait is facing up and it is affirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded lightly and took out a stack of banknotes from different pockets of clothing, with a denomination of 10 pounds, 5 pounds, and 1 pound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1450 pounds." Klein put the cash on the table and chairs next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A few steps back, no, five steps!" Emlin shouted cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein raised his hands with a smile and stepped back five steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin carefully moved closer and checked if there was any white paper in the pile of cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly counting points, he threw the suitcase in his hand to the transaction object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was shocked, quick-handed, and judged to accurately catch the suitcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is afraid that the glass bottle will be broken and the blood of the thousand-faced hunter will be infiltrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Emlin White took advantage of this opportunity to gather the banknotes and quickly retreated to the side of Father Uttraski. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was relieved and seriously checked the amount and authenticity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Klein couldn’t help but recall the picture just now, and suddenly he was ashamed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He and Emlin made the good Mother Earth Church just like the arms or drug trading scene...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirm the condition of the two materials, Klein He slammed his finger and let the match that was specially separated in the pocket ignited, so that the sudden rise of the red flame wrapped himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting until the flames fall, he is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Because he often meets with Emlin White in the Harvest Church, he does not mind now that Father Uttraski knows that he is helping the other to clear the darkness. The extraordinary person of personality even thinks that this can still climb a little friendship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin of the banknotes looked up and saw this scene for two seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He snorted and whispered to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My suitcase...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Tin Box..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a street illuminated by gas lamps, a carriage crushes through layers of water and moves toward the edge of Queens.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls has told his friend Hugh Dilcha that he has a teacher and re-takes an "apprentice" potion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After confirming that she did not show signs of getting out of control, she looked at the gas street lights that were much higher than her own eyes. I wondered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been very strange, why is it? Save in the form of materials, not potions? Your teacher can pre-adjust the potion and bring it over, no need to be busy on the spot. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folsh smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked him about this question, he There are two main reasons for this. First, different extraordinary materials have different uses. There is no way to use them flexibly if they are blended into a potion. Second, the extraordinary characteristics can be preserved when cured, but not after the magic potion. Unless there are special isolation techniques. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? Hume asked, "This is not a general pharmacy and an extraordinary weapon, and the spirituality will continue to scatter." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fols did not smile, but had to keep smiling:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a feature The problem of loss, but the extraordinary material once turned into a potion, not only humans can absorb, other creatures and even life-free materials can be, but relatively slower, for example, I use a glass bottle to store the potion, it looks no problem, But maybe a few days later, the glass bottle will completely "drink" the potion into a special magical item, and may even open up a certain amount of wisdom. Of course, my teacher said that this situation has a lot of side effects. It is the legacy of the loser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Seven Churches and some hidden forces have special isolation techniques, but they are quite cumbersome and will not use the low- and medium-sequence potions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s amazing!” Hugh said with sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the outside and lowered her voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s coming soon."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She and Fols are here to attend the extraordinary gathering of Mr. A. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls smiles like a knife:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope to have a spirited person "Stomach bag."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her teacher, Dorian Gray, taught her to play the law before leaving, and gave her a potion recipe for the "Master of Juggling". Let her try to find extraordinary materials. If the "apprentice" potion is not digested, please write to him and ask him for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This puts Flows in a state of confusion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I spent before What is the price and the method of playing the 'Master of the Master' for the big price?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So far, Tarot will be the most effective and irreplaceable to me. It is the precautions of the 'inverted man' and the 'justice', and the interference of the 'fool' to divination, otherwise I have been discovered by the teacher and cannot be his student..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it is the price paid for the curse of the full moon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking between turns Fols suddenly noticed that the house where Mr. A had a party had a clear collapse, and there were even traces of burnt black in many places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a fierce battle here...Who is dealing with Mr. A? Official organization? Fols immediately made a suggestion to Hugh and told the driver outside:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not here, then the first two streets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aurora meeting sites were discovered, terrorist organizations suffered heavy blows"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Klein just opened the newspaper and saw the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wish Mr. A died in this cofferdam." He solemnly drew a red moon on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already thrown the pituitary and blood of the Thousand-faced Hunter’s brain that was traded last night onto the fog, so as not to be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if I die, they won’t lose... Klein is very confident in chewing a piece of bacon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the transaction last night, his cash fell back below 1,000 pounds, leaving only 735 pounds, he can also buy deep sea Naga's hair, powerless Take into account the characteristics of the human skin shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no better clues and no money, Klein rested at home for a whole morning, waiting for lunch, before he went out and went straight to Bakerland. Bridge area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had previously agreed with Carlson of "Mechanical Heart", what information would go to the "lucky bar" near the West Bay Dock to find each other, if the news Especially important, and the other party is not, then directly go to the church, anyway, Sherlock Moriatti is not a member of the secret organization, do not need to be cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There wasn’t a lot of guests in the “lucky bar” in the afternoon, and Klein saw Carlson, who was sitting alone in the corner of the bar and drinking alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went over, knocked down the table, and pressed the voice to report:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People are spreading the original Creator faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlson sipped the wine made from pure malt, and replied unanswered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough... Klein whispered and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
