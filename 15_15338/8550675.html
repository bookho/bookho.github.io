			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Group snoring?" During this time, Dr. Deville, who has also been exposed to many psychologists, chewed the nouns given by Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His butler, his bodyguard, and his servant, even if he was not curious, did not make a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the sheriff’s Gate, who looked at Klein puzzled, a pair that has never heard of a similar concept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein controls the inertia of tapping the armrest of the sofa with his fingers, soothing and explaining:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Human beings are very susceptible to being deceived by the senses. Group snoring is a psychogenic problem caused by factors such as mental stress interacting within the same group."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; His series of professional vocabulary heard Sir Devil, Sergeant Gat, and so on, and subconsciously chose to believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I give a simple example. This is the case I have dealt with. A gentleman held a dinner party and invited a total of 35 guests at the dinner. On the other hand, he suddenly felt sick and spit out on the spot. He was accompanied by severe diarrhea, once, twice, three times. He began to think that he was food poisoning and went to the hospital while telling his guests about this guess. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the next two hours, there were more than 30 diarrhea in the 35 guests and 26 vomiting. They were packed in the hospital. The emergency room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The doctors examined and contrasted in detail, arguing that the original gentleman was not poisoned because of the weather changes and the icy spirits The gastrointestinal inflammation caused."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the most surprising thing is that not only did one of the guests who came to the hospital have been poisoned, not even one who was really sick. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is mass snoring "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deville slightly decapitated and praised:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand that humans are indeed easy to deceive Own, it is no wonder that Russell the Great said that a lie repeated a hundred times would become a truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police, what should I call you? You have seen me The most professional psychiatrist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moreti Inspector." Klein pointed out his own epaulettes. "Jazz, your troubles have been initially Solve, you can try to fall asleep now, let me confirm if there are other problems. If you can have a good dream, please allow us to leave in advance, no longer waiting for you to wake up."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Deville licked his forehead, took his cane, stepped upstairs and entered the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the carriage with the police coat of arms left the fountain at the door of Lord Deville. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sergeant Gat got off the bus and returned to his police station, Tolre Inspector looked at Klein, half complimented and joked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just thought you were a true psychologist..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words did not say Finished, because he saw that the young man wearing a black-and-white uniform on the opposite side barely showed any expression. His eyes were dark and deep, and his mouth was barely pulled up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I have only been in contact with some before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tole Inspector was quiet until the carriage stopped outside No. 36 Zouteland Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your help, let Sir Devil finally get rid of trouble and get back to sleep." He reached out and shook hands with Klein, "for me." Thanks to Dunn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped on the stairs and returned to the Blackthorn Security Company step by step, knocking on the door into the captain's office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Solved?" Dunn is waiting for his own lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resolved." Klein licked his forehead and said concisely and truthfully. "The root of the problem lies in the lead and porcelain factories under the name of Sir Deville. From the establishment to the present, there have been too many deaths from lead poisoning. The incident, and each incident, will allow Sir Deville to reap a bit of resentment that remains spiritual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Normally, these will not bring big The problem is that people love to have nightmares at the most." Dunn has handled similar cases and his experience is quite rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s slightest slogan:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the trajectory of things should have evolved like this, But unfortunately, Sir Deville once met a lead poisoned female worker on the street one day. She just fell to the side of the road and saw the dew's coat of arms. At the same time, she still had strong unwillingness, anxiety and Craving, until the jazz gave her parents, brothers and sister a compensation of 300 pounds, these emotions dissipated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a social issue, in this It’s not uncommon in the era of steam and machinery.” Dunn took out the pipe and sniffed a sigh and said, “The workers who make the linen, because they will moisten the material, wet themselves, and generally suffer from bronchitis and joint diseases, dust. In a serious factory, even if there is no poisoning, there will be lung problems... Call, we don’t have to discuss this, I believe it will be solved with the development of the kingdom, Klein, tonight, we are looking for a restaurant tonight. To celebrate your becoming a regular player "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow... Captain, I am today I used it for too long, and I used the technique of 'Dream Divination' to communicate directly with those resentments. I feel very tired. I hope to go home in the afternoon and have a good rest. Can you? Well, I will go at four or five. A divination club, observe the members' reaction to the sudden death of Hainas Vansente."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, this is what it should be." Hehe laughed, "That tomorrow night, next to the old Weir restaurant, I let Roshan go to the reservation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein holding the police cap Got it and said a courtesy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, captain, see you tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn raised his hand: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, you said that Sir Deville gave the woman’s parents a compensation of 300 pounds?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "Yes." Klein just nodded and understood that the captain had stopped calling himself. "Are you worried that they are suffering because of this wealth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Dunn sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have seen a lot of things like this, you give me their address, I let Cohen arrange them to leave Tingen, go In other cities, start a new life. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. Klein replied in silence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he left Dunn’s room and entered the diagonally opposite lounge, replacing the original suit. Leave the police uniform in his own wardrobe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a public carriage, Klein silently and wobbles back to Daffodil Street, taking off Drop the coat, take off the hat, find out the leftovers last night, get hot, and fill the stomach with the last oatmeal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He climbed up the second floor, hung up his clothes, fell down and lay down on the bed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he woke up, the pocket watch had gone to 2:10 pm, outside The sun is high, the light shines through the clouds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this brilliant golden, Klein stands beside the desk, looking out the belly window, looking at the clothes Old and ruined pedestrians, looking at them or entering or leaving Iron Cross Street.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... He sighed slowly and finally got rid of the low.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road has to go step by step, the sequence has to be upgraded layer by layer, everything has to be like this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head, Sit down and start summing up and sorting out the encounters of last week. The key points to keep in mind before retelling, so as to avoid forgetting and omissions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2:55.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
