			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news about Qieringus is not long, that is, it clarifies the time, place, people and results. The shorter the content, the bigger the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to the capital Beckland last night at 8:00, the city of Tingen had a newspaper disclosed this morning, the speed of information exchange in this world is not too slow Well, this is the outstanding contribution of Russell the Great... Well, it must be that the aristocrats and parliamentarians who attended the ball leaked the news to some good reporters, and some of them used the telegraph to make this a sensation. Sex news sent back to their respective newspaper headquarters in other counties...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morning newspapers are usually typeset at night, printed in the middle of the night, issued in the morning, just in case of emergency Adjusting and publishing in time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this news, today’s Tingen Morning News can sell at least a thousand copies, which is still only calculated in this city. In the case of the urban area...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kline’s thoughts were divergent and thought, and the heart was settled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Since the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qi Lingus died, it means that even if Mr. Azke is injured, it will not be too serious... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is more serious, he will definitely be caught by the custodian who is rushed or the extraordinary bodyguard of the Duke of Nigan, and encounters such an emergency situation. Miss 'Justice' and Mr. 'Inverted Man' will inevitably find every opportunity to report to me. The latter does not happen to prove that things are under control..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, if Mr. Azick did not reply to me before the early morning, or Mrs. 'Justice' and Mr. 'Hanging Man' did not pray to me, I will blow the copper whistle again and summon the messenger. Send a letter to ask..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relax, Klein's attention removed from the newspaper and looked around the public carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of people who have money to travel in this kind of transportation know the word, just influenced by the "outside", many people bought the "Tingen Morning News", now know Several of them are whispering: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A long time ago, the king of pirates and the generals were in danger of the route, except that the fleets facing each country would retreat. I don’t even look at the armed merchant ship... Although Kiringes was listed as one of the seven pirate generals for no more than a decade, it was the first big pirate to be killed by the government...”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Frankly speaking, I am curious, what did he do to Beckland? When the pirates left the ocean, death is something that can be foreseen."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that there will be more detailed reports in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The storm is on, I want to know now is the Duke of Nigan Which bodyguard killed the linglings, his bounty is 10,000 pounds!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"10,000 pounds...if there are 10,000 I immediately resigned, bought two or three small and medium-sized plantations, invested in stocks of colonial companies and railway companies, and enjoyed a fixed income every year..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is just a reward for the kingdom, and Intis, Fossack, Fenetport, and some commercial organizations have a reward for the 'Hurricane Lieutenant' Qilingus, and I am eager to have a newspaper that can make these rewards. All listed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10,000 pounds? Klein heard a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his current salary, he must not eat or drink for nearly twenty years to get so much money...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew early...forget it, I can't, I can't get a reward... He folded some newspapers and looked out the window of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, he finally confirmed that the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qi Lingues had come to an end, leaving only some finishing work, such as "downside down "The Russell Diary that will be paid." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Jowood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;False Wall and Hugh Deercha wearing a silk hat walked on the street to the nearest branch of Bavout Bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh deep has the same nod: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately, The book "Storm Mountain Villa" is more popular, and there are still remunerations to enter my account. Otherwise, I can only find a clinic or hospital and re-do the doctor." Fols sighed with satisfaction and worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hume for a few seconds, carefully asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This investigation will be held by the Qillingers Will it affect your authorship? After all, we may be punished by the punitive and the night keeper..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it will only be targeted It’s you.” Fols chuckled. “It’s you who are looking for someone to go to the police station to report the police. You are sending you a letter. You are also famous in the gangster circle and some streets in the Eastern District, and I, Foer. Si. Wall, who has always been a popular bestselling author recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." paused, "So, you have this time Are you accompanying me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folse licked his hair and smiled low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Don't you think this is a very interesting experience? Um... This experience has given me a lot of creative inspiration. My next novel is to write a story caused by a sudden murderer case. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Houston I don't know what language to use to deal with it. I can only go forward and forget the turn when I accidentally pull it back. At this moment, they heard the shouts of the newsboy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hurricane Lieutenant' Qi Lingus was killed in Beckland!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;what? what? Hugh and Fols looked at each other with a blank face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until the newsboys are far and near, repeating them several times before they wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Is Qieringus dead?" Folth couldn't believe his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is actually dead! How can he suddenly die!" is avoiding the murderous pirate may have a reverse chase and shock stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, shouldn’t this be a normal process? First, find clues, determine the purpose of Qilingus, then gather the strong, to ambush him, and finally the pirates are killed... As a result, the first step has not been completed, and Zilingus is dead... It’s so simple that it’s dead... Fols and Hugh, you look at me, I look at you like two marble statues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few tens of seconds, rushed to the newsboy and bought a Tassok newspaper this morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the three most widely distributed newspapers in the Kingdom of Lun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔...Qilingers is dead, and was killed by the Duke’s bodyguard... Goddess, the Duke of Nigan’s bodyguard is...” Hugh automatically silenced, did not say the "powerful extraordinary" behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fols looked at the good friend with pity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are completely convinced in the newspaper Description..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, maybe someone else discovered the purpose of Qilingus in advance, the punitive, the night, the mechanical heart, the military The high-level officials of the special department jointly completed a successful ambush..." Suddenly slammed and vomited. "We don't have to worry about anything anymore, we can return to normal life, but we must try to avoid the scope of the previous police station." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Folls and asked some questions with some anxiety:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think that Miss Audrey will pay us much, in this case? I know that for her, a few hundred pounds is not too much, but we have not really completed the commission..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
