			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw that Essinger Stanton’s back was clearly sunken and he felt his spine faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump, the former Essinger fell to the ground, seems to be so painful that he lost consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caslana, who punched that punch, stood in the same place, gasping with a sigh of relief, his forehead was cold sweat, and there was no follow-up attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just woke up from a long nightmare caused by emotions, the whole body's strength has completely disappeared into the previous outbreak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, call, Caslana is shaking and will be soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s eyes slammed in two steps and rushed to the side of Essinger Stanton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went down halfway and tried to help each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Essinger there screamed in pain:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fast escape!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't care for me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, he doesn't think that a trio who lost a power in the blink of an eye can drag the "desire apostle", so let Klein flee immediately. Meet the official extraordinary, otherwise three people will die here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Essinger struggled to raise his right hand and tried to use some extraordinary Ability, so that the official extraordinary people in the distance can notice the anomalies inside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the miniature "telegraph machine" with a horn, it has long been Singer’s fall to the wall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s face hesitated, about to make a decision, and saw a thick black “liquid” flowing from the ceiling. Then, it quickly condensed into a dark figure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure seems to be completely wrapped in black curtains, only a pair of cold blue eyes are exposed.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he saw him, Klein seemed to see the emotions and desires of the strongest creatures:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear, anger, greed, jealousy, hunger, lust, etc., etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Desire The apostle did not waste the hard work and created the situation. He entered the living room in the first place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, in the detective trio, Caslana was emotional The eruption and collapse, Essinger Stanton's spine was severely damaged, and basically lost the power, only Klein was intact.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, except for the revolver and Extraordinary bullets, all his magical items are on the fog, and opposite is a sequence of 5 "desire apostles", a strong capable of training demon dogs!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Klein’s mouth was slightly tilted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand placed on the wound behind Essinger’s wound was slammed, let The obvious depression was transferred to the side and transferred to a rib!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most magical extraordinary ability of the "magician" :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Injury Transfer"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It allows the wound to be transferred once to the person, and the serious injury is a minor injury, but it is impossible to move the damage to others and items! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had just thought about the next step when he saw that Essinger Stanton was injured:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp There is no way to pretend that there is no way to let the "desire apostle" appear, and then transfer the wounds of the big detective, leaving him with only minor injuries to the rib fracture. At this time, Klein believes that Essinger will simultaneously deal with the "desire apostle" "This is the most instinctive dying struggle of mankind." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, even if the "desire apostle" finds that the situation is wrong, it is too late to get out of touch, and when Klein completes "treatment", he can join hands with the big detective. Entangling the target, delaying to the arrival of the official extraordinary! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, Essinger’s original ring on the outside of the ring surface showed a vibrant green, his body was quickly shrouded in faint brilliance, and the wound quickly recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fracture of his rib was cured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain of this big detective was just true, but it’s a fake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this overlaps with Klein’s help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "desire apostle" who is going to do this sees this scene, his eyes are steep and wide, and his body is stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not entangled and immediately turned and ran to the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, his body quickly collapsed into a thick black liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liquid penetrates into the ground and immerses into the wall, disappearing instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s raised right hand only had time to make a snap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air bullets ran through the open window and shot outside, hitting Mars, but the "desire of the apostles" had disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run very fast, I don’t hesitate... You are still not a demon... This is a big trouble later... Klein’s mouth twitched and turned Essinger Stanton, who stood up and stood up to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big detective just happened to look at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Will you treat?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Will you treat?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two spoke at the same time and asked the same question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at each other, Essinger shook his head and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think it was me. The default trap made him escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, his ring floated out of the gleam, and I looked around and confirmed "Desire Apostle" Already far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger explained two sentences immediately:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no chance to simulate similarity this afternoon. The ability to heal, later thought that this can be used to presuppose a trap, so that the 'desire apostle' appeared because of my serious injury, so deliberately wrapped the wound is exaggerated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He pointed to the high marks on the left arm near the shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, this came in handy, but I didn't expect you to deal with serious injuries, the result..." Essinger sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results both put the "treatment" injury in the first place, no one to entangle the "desire apostle", let the other party find it wrong, immediately escaped . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of me, or Stanton, there is a card or arrangement that the "desire apostle" does not know, and I want to use this to dig him, who knows that they counteract each other. Let go of the goal... Is this the right thing to do? Klein couldn’t help but laugh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is because we don’t know enough about each other, and we don’t have enough understanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No, it's my fault." Essinger said sincerely, "When you see that you have not escaped or guarded against defense, instead of coming to help me, I should reason that you are not confused, you have the confidence, you have a way, Unfortunately, when I wear this ring, my brain has been in a state of high load operation, and it is difficult to think too much about extra things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2 -081" This seal also has the effect of passive intelligence... Klein smiled and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Stanton, this is not to discuss who is responsible At that time, the 'Desire Apostle' has already fled, we have to consider what to do next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger took the ring and turned it At the door of the room:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The official extraordinary arrived soon, I went outside to appease Stuart and they then ? & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp a way out, you are with me, or do first own things "<br <br /> & nbsp />;The official extraordinary... Before Mr. Stanton mentioned the value of the night, the heart of the machine and the military... Don’t be an acquaintance... Well, my spiritual instinct didn’t show any warnings, it shouldn’t be... Mr. Stanton, let me Have the opportunity to pack up and deal with sensitive items, so as not to be troubled by unfriendly official extraordinary people... Klein flashed a lot of thoughts and thought, asking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Mr. Stanton, where did you get the position of the "desire apostle"?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger thought: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your bedroom, sitting at your desk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Really arrogant... ...Klein pointed out the door:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went there to check to see if there were any traces.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If you can grasp the true appearance of the 'desire apostle', it will be much easier to hunt him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Other things are bothering you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Essinger walks On one side, he helped the weak and weak Kaslana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Klein was a little funny:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just discussed so much, doing Well prepared and buried the trap, the result still failed to drag the "desire apostle", and made it look like this... The accident is always better than the preparation... So the "magician" is just the sequence 7...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the room, Klein went straight to the second floor and walked into his bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout inside did not change at all, even the distance between the chair and the table was no different from before, but Klein seemed to see a figure wrapped in dark liquid. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat there, looking straight ahead, patiently and calmly waiting for the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a “cold-blooded person”... Klein looked at the glass of the convex window and thought it might be possible to divinate what it had reflected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Demon" approach is very good at crime, it should not be so easy to leave clues... but you can try it on the fog... Klein checks the circle , began to burn some occult notes that were made by hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not take long to see a few strangers on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the first person is a man with a hard face, but he has a fluffy, messy, stubborn brown hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a strange ancient silver mirror in his hand, with black gems on both sides of the mirror as "eyes". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Mr. Moriarty, I am Icons Bernard of the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery, can I check it out here? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein 颔First:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was immediately polite:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need me to be there, answer some questions at any time?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, trouble you, Mr. Stanton has mentioned your situation." ICONSER showed a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed several players, and his attitude towards Klein was different, some ignored, some were curious, and some were not low hostility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My situation? How did Mr. Stanton introduce me and what kind of story was written? Klein's thoughts turned around, followed by Icons, and entered the bedroom again. The rest of the official extraordinary were two people, scattered to take charge of different areas on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is where the "desire apostle" sat?" Icons pointed to the chair in front of the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has apparently asked Essinger Stanton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Klein calmly replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
