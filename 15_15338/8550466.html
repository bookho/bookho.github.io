			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his sister’s confused eyes, Klein suddenly felt that this was an opportunity. He looked up and down at each other and said with a serious expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melissa, you don't have enough respect for today's dinner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Melissa looked Do not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pointed at her neck:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a woman, you still have one missing Embellished here with the necklace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the opening of the sister, he smiled and took out a silver amulet surrounded by angel feathers from his pocket:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I have prepared for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."Melissa is first Hey, he immediately asked, "How much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister, the focus of your concern is not right... Klein silently spit a sentence, laughing and explaining道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, it is not expensive, because it was only a semi-finished product. I modeled the artifacts I had seen before, and carved the spells of blessings and beautiful patterns. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You carved?" Melissa was really taken care of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? What do you think of my craft?" Klein handed the amulet to her sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa turned over and looked at her eyes and bit her lip:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I like the angel feathers around me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the spells and symbols I carved are very ugly, just say it, don't cover it... The main effect of the amulet is the effect! Klein's mouth was slightly pumped, and he was waiting to persuade his sister to accept it. He saw Melissa wearing a silver-faced necklace on her neck with a look of "difficulty" and carefully placed the position of the amulet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perfect." Klein glanced at it and praised it with exaggeration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa glared at him, looking down at the amulet, sulking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Klein, you didn't do this before, so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe because of good work, good income, the whole person has become Confidence." Klein interrupted his sister's words and explained it first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哎, although I have received the memory fragments of the original Lord, there is no problem in the big aspect, but in some details, I still habitually present the true character... especially After Benson and Melissa get along more and more naturally... He sighed secretly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa seems to have approved his reasons and swears:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You It’s very good now, it’s really good...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two chats between brothers and sisters, Banson changed clothes and went downstairs, white shirt, black vest, tuxedo The black bow tie and the trousers of the pen made him a whole new look, like the successful person who had his own career after many years of hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hairline is also very similar...Kline’s heart smirked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great, Benson, you are suitable for this." He smiled and spread his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa is also nodding her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that clothes are more important than myself." Benson ridiculed himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the opportunity to take out the remaining amulet and repeated the previous rhetoric. The last words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I also made one for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life is always full of surprises and surprises." Klein replied with a smile. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the brothers and sisters picked up themselves, walked out of the gate, and took the trackless public carriage to reach the corner of Fania Street in the North District where Selena’s family was located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wood House is also a townhouse, but unlike Klein, there is a porch with a small lawn in front of it, which is more elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pulling the doorbell, Klein, Benson, and Melissa just waited for a dozen seconds and saw today's protagonist Selena Wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This girl with a long burgundy hair gave Melissa a hug:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I like your skirt, it makes you look particularly beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina is next to her father, Mr. Wood, Bakerland Senior employee of the bank's Tingen branch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Welcome, our respectable brother, welcome you, our young historian." He exaggeratedly greeted Benson and Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young historian... Why not add a "conscience" description... Klein whispered a few words, took off his hat, and smiled and responded: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Wood, you are more spiritual and younger than I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His compliment style Unconsciously, he turned to the big food empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson reached out and grasped the old Wood:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know a lot Bank employees, but they are all proud and stiff, just like the latest models of machines, no one is as graceful as you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are in the bank Come to me, maybe it won't be evaluated." Old Wood smiled very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the chill, Selena wearing a new long skirt slightly jumped and led the brothers and sisters to the inside, sometimes the volume said "Elizabeth has arrived", sometimes Depressing the voice to Melissa said, "Your two brothers are more handsome than I imagined." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, my hearing is very good... although you are saying praise... Kline is helplessly looking at the two sixteen people walking side by side. Old girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I am still a short distance from this handsome and handsome... Hey, Miss Selena, what did you think of me and Benson before? How ugly? A restrained and gloomy, not trimmed, pale, eyesless, a thin hair, premature aging? Klein squeezed his eyebrows and practiced "spirituality" diligently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Selina is in good health, emotionally excited, very happy... Mr. Wood’s lungs are a little problem, yes, I saw his pipe... Klein was in a good mood to scan the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elizabeth, Melissa is coming." At this time, Selena greeted her with a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl in a long blue lace dress came over, she had natural long brown hair and a lovely baby fat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked awkward because he knew the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the underground trading market, he also helped the other person choose amulets! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth first greeted Melissa and then looked at Benson and Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was there, her brow furrowed and seemed to be thinking about something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyway, Elizabeth smiled and said hello if nothing happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein also pretended not to recognize each other, led by Old Wood, came to the living room sofa area, was introduced to Selena’s brother Chris and others The guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't have such communicative skills... He picked up a pre-dinner drink from the corner table, quietly listened, nodded from time to time, and echoed and laughed twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long before the guests arrived and the dinner officially began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are too many invited guests, Wood's table can't afford it, so the dinner is in the form of self-service, the maid will steak, roast chicken, fried fish, potatoes Mud and other foods are placed on different plates and placed on different tables. The male servant is responsible for cutting and making the components suitable for use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw the elegant enamel plates and silver knives and forks, could not help but secretly feel that only the middle class Wood family is too luxurious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since this is so rich, why should Chris prepare for the wedding for a few more years?" He wondered what the sister had said, "Well. Perhaps it is just to prepare for the tableware for a few years. For such a family, decent is very important!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Klein Pick up a porcelain plate and come to the table and fork a piece of barbecued honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Elizabeth, with her cute baby fat on her face, came close and looked at the food and whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that you are Melissa's brother... Thank you, Selina likes the amulet I sent, saying that I feel healthy when I just wear it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina... amulet... Klein suddenly remembered the reason why the girl next to her chose the amulet:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give one A friend who likes occultism to make a birthday present! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friend is Selena? Selena likes things in the mysterious realm? Klein frowned slightly and politely laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That may be just a placebo effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; After saying this, he began to wait for the other side to praise Russell the Great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eg Elizabeth’s reaction is a sly ignorance:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is a placebo?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a purely psychological effect. Sometimes, if we believe that we will get better, we will really get better." Klein explained roughly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, she said that it is different from the amulet she bought in the past, and it feels different." Elizabeth stressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Klein sideways and curiously said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't think about Meli Sha's brother turned out to be a mysterious expert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, I am studying history and always come into contact with similar things." Ryan took the topic with no trace and asked, "You are also in the technical school in Tingen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I and Selena, Melissa used to be a classmate. Later they went to a technical school. I was in the nearby Ivos school." Elizabeth explained it earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public school is not a public school, but a school for public enrollment, evolved from a good grammar school, aiming at cultivating graduates who can enter the university Tuition is quite expensive and will examine the student's family background, even if the average middle class is unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t talk much, she returned to Selena when she picked the good food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations to today’s protagonist’s happy birthday, the dinner is coming to an end, and Klein and Benson are invited to join the ranks of Texas Hold'em, the small blind and half a penny, The big blind was 1 pence, and Melissa and Elizabeth, Selena and other friends went to the second floor. I don't know if I was chatting or playing other games. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had a bad luck today, played for twenty, and didn’t even get a good hand, he could only watch the cards and fold. As a spectator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
