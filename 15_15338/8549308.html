When he heard Dunn’s words, Klein’s heart suddenly burst into a storm, and the instinct blurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary have serious hidden dangers? So that the judiciary inside the church, the extraordinary person dealing with evil events, is also prone to problems? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den Smith enters the car and sits in the previous position, with a constant expression and tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not something you need to know, nor is it something you can understand unless you become a member of us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is dumb Followed by sitting down, half is funny and half incomprehensiblely asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't figure this out, how can you make a decision to join?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without joining, you can't understand, this is a dead loop...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dune Smith once again Take out the pipe and take a breath on the nose:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You probably misunderstood, one of our members includes the civilian."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, as long as you become a civilian, you can understand the secrets, understand the hidden dangers of the extraordinary and the dangers that may be encountered, and then consider whether to become extraordinary. Problem? "Klein edge organize your thoughts, re-side in their own words describe the meaning of each other again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, except for one point, that is not you If you think of becoming an extraordinary person, you will be able to become. In this respect, the churches are equally strict."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not strict, weird...Klein’s belly With a gesture of strengthening the tone: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the civilian staff? Should this be strict?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is you, then there should be no problem." Dunn's eyes were half-closed, his expression slightly sniffing the pipe, but did not ignite the tobacco. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Klein once again fell into doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he self-tune in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am special, I The aura of the traversing, like the fireflies in the night, so bright, so outstanding? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den’s half-closed eyes, ashes as before:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" First, in this kind of event, we can survive without our help. This shows that you have advantages different from others, such as lucky, and lucky people are always very popular."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Klein become a dull expression, he smiles slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, you should be A humorous statement, secondly, you are a graduate of the history department of Hoy University. This is what we really need. Although the attitude of the Lord of Lourmi’s storm is disgusting to women, he is in society, The humanities, economic and political views are still sharp. He said that talent is a key factor in maintaining competitive advantage and good development. I agree with this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Founding that Klein frowned slightly, he explained casually: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should be able to imagine that we will often Touching the Quaternary and even earlier literature and articles, many cults and many heretics try to gain strength from these things. Sometimes, they themselves can lead to strange and terrible things."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Except for the extraordinary people in special fields, most of us are not good at learning, or have passed that age." Here, Dunn Smith pointed to his head, the corner of the mouth As self-deprecating, "Those boring, boring knowledge always makes people want to sleep, even if they don't sleep, they can't resist. In the past, we will cooperate with historians and archaeologists, but there will be hidden secrets. The risk of leakage may also bring bad experiences to professors and associate professors. Therefore, it is a good thing for a professional to join and become a member of us."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded lightly, accepted Dunn's statement, and asked divergently: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you didn't directly go before, um, develop one?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den continues to say to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the third and final The most important point is that you have been exposed to similar incidents, inviting you to have no violation of the confidentiality clause, and otherwise developing others. If it fails, I will bear the responsibility of secret disclosure. Our team members, our civilians, are absolutely Part of it comes from inside the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When quietly listening, Klein is curious:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Why are you so strict and confidential? Many things are published and spread out, let more people know, can't you avoid the same mistakes happening again? The biggest fear comes from the unknown, we can make the unknown become known."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, human stupidity is beyond your imagination, but instead Lead to more imitation, more confusion and more serious incident. "Dunn Smith replied, shaking his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein "Well", something is clear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Human from history The only lesson learned is that human beings cannot learn any lesson from history and always repeat the same tragedy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The famous quote of Russell’s emperor Full of philosophy." Dunn agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......What did Russell the Great say? The stalker's predecessors are really three hundred and sixty degrees without a dead end, and they don't leave a chance for the latecomers. Klein didn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den turned his head and looked out of the carriage. The dim light of the street lights became a radiance of civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... There is a similar discourse within the judiciary of the major churches. This may be the main reason for strict confidentiality and prohibiting ordinary people from knowing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?" Kline’s spirit is alive, with a sneak peek into the hidden pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun returned to his head and his facial muscles were slightly invisible:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And fear brings trouble, more faith and fear bring more trouble until everything is destroyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After saying this, he sighed.道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And in addition to praying for the blessing and help of the gods, mankind cannot solve the real big troubles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Belief and fear bring trouble, more faith and fear bring more trouble..." Klein silently recited this sentence, not too understandable, and then because of the unknown feeling of fear that is not too understanding, as if In the shadow of the street lamp outside, in the darkness of no light, there are hidden pairs of malicious eyes and open mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horseshoes are agile, the wheels are rolling, the Iron Cross Street is far away, Dunn breaks the sudden silence and officially invites:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to join us and become a civilian?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thoughts emerged, short-term undecided, thought: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I think about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a big deal, and you can’t rush to make a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, just give me a reply before Sunday." Dunn nodded. "Of course, remember confidentiality, can't relate Welch." The incident tells others, including your brother and sister, that if they violate, they will not only cause trouble to them, but also lead you to a special court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Klein solemnly replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no word in the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing Iron Cross Street is approaching, coming home, Klein suddenly thought of a question, hesitated for a few seconds or asked:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Smith, what is the salary and treatment of your civilian staff?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
