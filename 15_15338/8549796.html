			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notes of the Antignus family are in the room opposite the kidnappers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is a coincidence, Klein believes that he feels right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately turned away from the bed, taking off two or three times to take off the old clothes worn while sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the white shirt next to him and put it on his body, fast buttoning from top to bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, two, three... He suddenly noticed "less" buttons, and the left and right sides seemed to be less symmetrical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a closer look, Klein found himself wrong with the buttons from the beginning, making the shirts distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head helplessly, took a deep breath, slowly spit out, and applied some meditation skills to restore his calmness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When wearing a white shirt and black trousers, he barely fits the underarm strap and takes out the revolver hidden under the soft pillow. Within. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to tie the bow tie, he put on his formal attire and walked to the door with a cap and a cane in one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wearing a half-height silk hat, Klein gently twisted the handle, opened the door and entered the hallway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully close the bedroom door, he is almost like a thief, underground stairs, leaving two lines of words in the living room pen and paper, indicating that he forgot last night If the company has something to do, it needs to arrive early today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the gate, Klein felt a refreshing cool breeze and the whole person was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street in front of him is dark and silent, no pedestrians, only the light of the gas street lamp shines quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the pocket watch from the inside pocket and slammed it open and saw that just after six o'clock, the moonlight of the blush had not completely faded, but the sky had already A touch of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is planning to find an expensive rental coach hire, and suddenly saw a double-horse four-wheeled trackless public carriage coming over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a public carriage so early?" Klein was a little surprised, greeted him and waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, sir." The coachman skillfully stopped the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff responsible for the charges next to him covered his mouth with his hand and yawned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to Zouteland Street." Klein said as he pulled out two 1p, four and a half pennies from his trouser pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"4 pence." The staff responsible for the charge did not hesitate to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy the fare, Klein got on the carriage, and saw that it was empty, there were no other guests, and there was a clear silence in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the first." The coachman said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two brown horses stepped forward and walked relatively briskly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Frankly, I didn't expect to have a public carriage so early." Klein sat close to the driver's seat and replied casually to distract Be careful to ease your inner tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coachman ridiculed himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every day from 6pm to 9pm, but my weekly salary is only 1 Pound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there no time to rest?" Klein asked strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A day off for a day off." The coachman's tone became heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The toll collector next to him added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are responsible for 6 am to 11 noon Point, then go to lunch, go to lunch break, wait until after dinner, it is six o'clock, then replace colleagues... even if we don't have to rest, two horses are needed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"It used to be not like this. Since some coachmen are too tired, there are mistakes that should not be made, the horses are out of control, the carriages are overturned, and there is such a rotation... How can the group of vampires suddenly become kind!" The driver laughed. One sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning light, the public carriage drove towards Zouteland Street, with only seven or eight passengers along the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a little relief, Klein stopped talking, closed his eyes, and flashed yesterday’s experience frame by frame to see if there were any other omissions. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the raging sun was fully raised, the sky was really bright and the public carriage arrived at Zouteland Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pressed his hat with his left hand and jumped out of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly entered No. 36 Zouteland Street and arrived at the Blackthorn Security Company along the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the door is closed and not yet open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the keychain from his waist, found the corresponding color of the brass color, stuffed it into the hole, and "clicked". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed forward, let the door slowly open, and saw the black-haired green Leonard Mitchell sniffing the recently popular cigarettes . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I prefer cigars...you look eager?" The poet-like night-timer asked easily and comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain?" Klein did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard pointed to the partition:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In his office. As a 'sleepless The person's promotion is extraordinary. He only needs to rest for two hours during the day. I think those factory owners and bankers definitely like this potion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein nodded and walked through the partition and saw that Dunn Smith had opened the door of the office and stood at the entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?" He was wearing a black trench coat and carrying a gold-plated cane with a calm and serious expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have the feeling of 'who seems to have seen it', it should be the note, the notes of the Antigonus family." Klein Try to control yourself and make the answer clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where?" Dunn Smith's face has not changed significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Kline’s inspiration tells him that there seems to be a distinct, invisible fluctuation in the other side, which may be the sparkle of the spirit or the change of mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the place where Leonard and I rescued the hostage yesterday, across the room of the kidnapper, I didn't notice it until I had a dream and got it. Revelation." Klein did not make any concealment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I missed a very big credit yesterday." Leonard, who didn't know when to go to the partition, chuckled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den’s slightly decapitated, solemnly commanding:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Let Cohenri replace the old Neil guards the arsenal and lets the old Neil and Frye go with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard did not act frivolously, immediately notified the night entertainment In the interior of Cohenli and Frye, one of them is a "sleeper" and the other is a "collector." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five minutes later, the two-wheeled carriage belonging to the night squad quickly ran up, and the pedestrians were not too early in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard wearing a felt hat, wearing a shirt and vest, temporarily acting as a coachman, from time to time to sway the whip out of thin air, let it make a crisp sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the compartment, Klein and Daniel are sitting on the same side, opposite Dunn Smith and Frye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skin of the "collector" is as white as it has not been sunburned for a long time, or severely ischemic, he is about thirty years old, brunette blue Eyes, nose and nose are high, lips are thin, temperament is cold and dark, it seems that some of the perennial touch of the body left a thin taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
