			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning cut through the sky and illuminate the dark walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick Berger bears a leather bag and carries a "hurricane axe" to stand outside the door with nearly ten teammates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up, he saw the black soil dry and hard slag between the walls of the city wall, but grew a cluster of tenacious weeds, they wandered like humans s hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he heard a slight footstep and was busy taking his eyes and looking at the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the alternation of lightning and darkness, a tall figure slowly walked over, carrying two introverted straight swords at the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, his pale and messy hair, sorrowful eyes, twisted and worn old scars, year-round brown coat and linen shirt, successively Reflected in the eyes of Dairik and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winner is the chief of the Six-member Parliament of Silver City, Colin Iliad, a powerful "hunter". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Dairik’s greeting, the subconscious mind turned his attention to the chief’s waist, where there was a belt that was divided into many compartments, each of which was lined with metal. Different vials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a "hunter" experience and a strong representation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek used to listen to his parents, "Hunter" is good at discovering the weaknesses of different monsters, identifying the use of various materials, and can be unique In the meditation mode, for the former, with the latter, the preparation of the corresponding magical pharmacy, holy paste, essential oil and special imprint, and then, by taking, smearing, using these items, to achieve the goal of restraint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sense, experienced, knowledgeable, well-prepared, responsive "hunter" is the nemesis of most monsters, they are waist The number and type of metal vials between them represent their “experience”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is just some of the extraordinary abilities that the "hunter" has, and they can’t be called "half-god" or "holy". of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin looks around and confirms that all the players have arrived, and he is quiet and open:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Light up, set off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two members immediately lit the candle in the lantern, letting the dim light shine through the thin leather . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "daytime" with high lightning frequency, there is no need to use candles in Silver City, because every two or three seconds, there is "light", and The surrounding monsters have been cleared over and over again, but once you leave Silver City and enter the depths of the dark, you must keep the candlelight at all times, otherwise as long as the lightning does not catch up at a certain stage, resulting in a matte environment of more than five seconds. The team will be attacked by certain monsters with a high probability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce battle is not the most terrible development, and what Dyrick remembers is a story his parents have told. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time, when they explored the depths of the dark, because the previous stage was fighting the corrosive corpse, the candle failed to change in time, so they had to bear the longest Eight seconds deep and dark, until the lightning came back, the candlelight reappeared, they suddenly saw that there were only five of the original eight teammates, and the other three were silent, disappeared unconsciously, and never appeared again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a breath, Dairik clenched the "Hurricane Axe" and walked in the middle of the team, following the chief in the direction of the reservation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lightning bolt illuminates the plain fields filled with black grass and looks like a sinister painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exploratory team of 10 extraordinary people walked on the road full of broken stones and went deep into the black grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning subsides, and the darkness of the darkness rewinds, almost completely engulfing them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dim candlelight pierced the leather, faintly and swayingly clinging to the surrounding area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East, a greasy cheap cafe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the previous agreement, Klein found the old Kohler who was applying margarine to the toast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the crumpled cigarettes on the table and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Newly bought?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, the previous ones haven’t been taken any more, but they’re always taken with them, and occasionally they’re sniffing, Oh, this reminds me of the wandering life. At that time, I really felt that I might die at any time." Old Kohler's tone was slightly scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took out 20 Soules change in advance and sat down and pushed to the other side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I was very satisfied with the last information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the old Kohler modesty, he turned his head and looked at the counter:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A loaf of oatmeal, two slices of toast, a piece of butter, a piece of potato goulash, 1 pence of tea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mori Mr. Yadi, didn’t you have dinner yesterday?” Old Kohler took the banknote and took a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shook his head and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be very busy next, maybe I have no time to use Lunch.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to pretend that he is very active and serious, after all, he took the £100 fee from Prince Edessac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler didn’t ask much, and when he watched it, he put the money into his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last thing you asked me to inquire about the results. Azick Aegus’s reward came from several gangster bosses and some intelligence dealers. Well, I don't know who trusted them, it's hard to contact them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military nine... Klein nodded:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sufficient, no need to go deeper, that is too dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler breathed a sigh of relief Said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first two days, someone in the cheap hotel on the Golden Cape Street, saw a guy suspected of Azick Aegis, said to be on the reward list The photos are basically the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein’s heart stunned, not shocked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And then? Did I just prepare for this reward, and the matter is over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then? With clues, many bounty hunters quickly rushed The past, but nothing was found, the amount, he He said that the room had signs of a struggle. "Kohler old trying to remember to gather their own messages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information will definitely give the MI9 first... Is this Mr. Azke and they have a secret contest? I don't know what the result is... Klein looked at the boss who came over the plate and pretended to be indulging in the old Kohler:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You wait for the next I went to the Golden Cloak Street, maybe I could find some clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the breakfast time in the Eastern District has passed, and there are very few guests in the cheap cafe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Old Kohler agreed without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A total of sixteen and one-half pennies." The boss put the breakfast that Klein had on the table. The beef in the potatoes was not much, but it was stewed. Very bad, at first glance, it was prepared in advance, and the strong aroma of the old Kohler could not help but swallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After paying the money, Klein picked up the fork and spoon and said to the old Kohler:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are no ones who are looking for fools, except for a few stubborn bounty hunters... many unemployed textile women workers, including some men The worker left the Eastern District..." Old Kohler said in a strip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Klein swallowed the beef, raised his head, "Leaving the Eastern District?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"It should be that I found another job. I went to the specific place. I can't find out." Old Kohler answered truthfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Their family doesn't know?" Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some are left with unemployed family members, some have no family members themselves, and come from outside to Beckland to find a job." Old Kohler has done some research. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the choice of the object, there is a problem with this matter... Klein first wrote down and continued to eat while listening to Old Kohler’s story about the Eastern District during this time. Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the time of the next meeting, he put down the tableware, wiped his mouth, and picked up the hat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the Golden Cloak Street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden Cloak The only cheap hotel on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the two-penny fee, the boss led Klein and Old Kohler to the room where the suspected Azick Aegis had lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A lot of bounty hunters came during this time, hey, I made a lot of money, so I kept the same." The boss opened the door with the key. Pointing at the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at it and saw the fallen chair and the rag scattered around, and there was no other trace of fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a high level of inspiration, Klein turned his attention to the bottom of the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gazing for two seconds, he walked over and bent over to take the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗, a little dust flew up, a light black mouse came out from the bottom of the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks normal, without any problems, but in Kline’s vision, its gas field color is only black and green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouse turned a corner and climbed the wall, exposing the abdomen to Klein's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft place, the flesh and blood are green, the pus is flowing, you can directly see the same decaying internal organs inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thoughtfully retracted his sight, to the old Kohler, who did not pay attention to the mouse at all:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is Azick Aegis' reward been taken back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Old Kohler must have shaken his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has reviewed it again and stepped outside:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go, nothing worthwhile The clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 Minsk Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the "busy" outside, Klein ran into the bed early and entered the dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continually and sometimes fragmented glimpses pass by, and Klein suddenly wakes up and knows that he is dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was power to invade my dreams... Klein maintained the state of being confused and inadvertently looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found himself in the suburbs, full of fertile fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A river rushes from a distance and bends around the cliff in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one side of the cliff is bare and reveals pure white rock. From afar, there is an unusually holy beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the river bay, nearly ten men and women with various utensils, wearing black coats or dark jackets are surrounded by a hidden underground entrance. There is Klein's acquaintance, Icons Bernard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Ya town...Stefford Bay...Mechanical heart... Are they exploring the mausoleum of the Amon family? But why is there a scene in my dream? Klein wondered for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
