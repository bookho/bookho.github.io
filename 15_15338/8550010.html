			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Monday morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no trip to Klein, but the letter to the instructor Cohen Quentin and the excess stamp fee were paid to Melissa, and the sister was entrusted to the court. Post office delivery near the Roots Technical School. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast, he leisurely made up for the lack of sleep during the “work” period, until he was close to noon, and his stomach was awkward before he got up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot the leftovers of last night, licked a loaf of oatmeal, and Kline took a newspaper and entered the bathroom on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever this time, he couldn’t help but sigh without a cell phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven or eight minutes, he came out in a refreshing manner, washed his hands, returned to the bedroom, and locked the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Klein pulled the curtains, lit the gas lamp, did half an hour of meditation, practiced for half an hour of spiritual vision, spiritual pendulum and wand, with The way of recollections reviewed an hour of occult knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing these things, he tore the old newspaper into dozens of groups, and wrote the names of the materials such as "moon flower candle" and "full moon oil", step by step. Simulated the process of ritual magic to master the details - before he was truly skilled and learned more, he did not intend to rush to try ritual magic, because it would waste material and be dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and over again, Klein picked up a silver-and-white pocket watch with a vine pattern, and glanced at it and found that it was just two and forty-five minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He considered taking a few seconds to take the used newspapers to the first floor kitchen for burning, and he adjusted the state to prepare for the Tarot party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relocking the door of the bedroom again, Klein did not wait for the arrival of three o'clock, intends to enter the fog ahead of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to take this opportunity to explore there! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein stood in the room and was about to start walking counterclockwise, he suddenly worried about "justice" and "downside down" into the right environment. Will it be disturbed and discovered by others, and think of one thing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he has to figure out a way to let "justice" and "downside down" If you really can't get rid of it, or if you encounter something else, you can "please leave" in advance and absent from the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the former Klein, this is an almost unsolvable problem. He can’t manually drive a different world instant messaging network, the way of cable telegraph It will expose itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, he has found inspiration from the ritual magic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the help of external forces Ritual magic is to pray for different existences to help, similar curses will definitely have a clear direction at the beginning, such as the god of the night, the blush of the Lord, such as the description of the unknown, hidden existence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then can I modify the spell and let the description at the beginning point to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"point me..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this way, 'justice' and 'downside people' can get the corresponding information even if they hold a ceremony in a foreign country."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s spirit suddenly rose and began to analyze the feasibility of this approach:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two difficulties, first I am not a strong sequencer to a certain extent. Even if the description of the mantra does point to me, I am unlikely to receive a 'request'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp; "Second, how to ensure that the description of the mantra can point me precisely, to ensure that it will not be misplaced, and that the other unknowns that match the description will bring great danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein paced back and forth, pondering possible solutions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sound, he turns round and round, and naturally connects this thing to the mysterious world above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't receive the 'request', it doesn't mean that the fog is not good, and the combination of it and the deep red star can directly pull the person into the space. , ignoring the distance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can consider bundling me with the mysterious space association when doing a directional description..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In accordance with this line of thinking, I can’t When the other party holds the ceremony, they immediately receive the 'request', but as long as they enter the fog, they can see the corresponding information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In simple terms, The difference between QQ's online and offline messages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is more and more excited, I think this idea can be tried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, what description should I use to point me precisely to the gray world?" He began to consider the details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he has a curse that can be successful, that is, the pure Lun transliteration of "Fusheng Xuan Huang Tianzun", but the problem is that this will cause him to lose The control over the fog, losing the dominant position, can only be ruled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...'fool from a different world'? No, this is accurate enough, almost no other existence is eligible, but it will expose me to the maximum The secret..." Klein thought of one spell after another, but they all negated themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven or eight minutes, he finally finalized the first directional description in the mantra:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The fool who does not belong to this era."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously not precise enough, and Klein quickly added a paragraph:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mysterious ruler above the fog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of the two can almost be limited to him, and will be foggy Bundled with himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's still a little bit, don't rule out that there are multiple spaces above the fog, multiple masters, don't rule out this description pointing to the spirit world..." Klein wrinkles Brow, I plan to add another insurance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well... He considered it for a full minute and finally thought about the last paragraph:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The king of yellow and black who is in good luck!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an approximate translation of "Fusheng Xuan Huang God". If it is only it, it is likely to run. Wrong, provokes the danger of being unknown, but with the limitations of the first two, with the example of a similar mantra entering the fog, the object of description can be completely locked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the three paragraphs to hold the ritual magic, Klein does not know if it will have an effect, but it is sure that it will not attract other existing concerns, no It will put "justice" and "downside down" into danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a long breath and meditated on the thoughts that were good:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" A fool who does not belong to this era, you are the mysterious ruler above the fog, you are the king of yellow and black who is in charge of good luck..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not Visible nod, licking the pocket watch in the pocket to determine the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two to fifty-eight..." Klein no longer thought about it, collecting pocket watches, entering meditation, accompanied by a curse, walking counterclockwise Four steps, went into a square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most violent noise and the most screaming screams sounded again, and he felt the headache that was more intolerable than taking the "Divination" potion. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is different from the severe pain that the head is pierced. It is a kind of manic, irrational, and confusing pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein controls himself in a meditation manner and tries not to listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whispers and whispers retreat, his body is light, his spirituality is light, and everything is erratic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boundless fog appears in his sight, and the deep red stars are far or near, like an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, the palace of the giant residence is still standing, it seems to exist here for millions of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is just a heartbeat, the figure has disappeared in place, sitting on the bronze long table with 22 high back chairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ritual effect is indeed fixed... He whispers, tapping his eyebrows, letting the gray mist cover himself, thicker than ever - according to the description of "downside down", if "justice" becomes the audience, then the most Don't show your behavior in front of her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without time to explore, Klein stretches out his right hand, constructs an invisible connection, and communicates the two familiar crimsons. Stars.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep blue sweeping the sea of ​​Sonia, an ancient The sailboats went down the wind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger Wilson locked himself in the captain's room, giving the ghost ship the highest level of protection.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pocket watch in front of him spread out, beside the brass sextant, walking slyly, not happy, nervous.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hour, minute and second hands just point to the correct position, and Alger Wilson’s eyes burst into a deep red, ignoring the layers of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哎... His sigh echoes in the captain's room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Queens.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey Hall is leaning against a velvet pillow and looking again The yellow-brown paper in my hand, the jewel-like eyelids seem to hide two slowly rotating soul whirlpools.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes are calm and cold, like Waiting for a drama to be staged.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep red explosion broke out, and she looked at herself with a overlooking attitude.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, in the grand palace, the bronze long table is mottled and ancient.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey Hall’s figure just appeared, and Klein, who had opened the vision early, looked at the past and did not accidentally see the color of the other’s gas field. Mixed into one, pure, quiet as a lake that clearly reflects things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She really became an extraordinary person... Klein was waiting to look away and suddenly found that the high back chair belonging to Miss Justice was changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars on the back of the chair fly fast, forming an unreal constellation that is not a reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Kline’s eyes, this constellation is so familiar, because it is a symbol in occult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A symbol that symbolizes the "Dragon"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience...The dragon...Klein controlled himself without shaking his head and explored the high-back seat of the "downside down man". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, from the perspective of his line of sight, the situation of the back of the chair must not be seen, but this is his home, and everything is presented according to his will. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constellation behind the seat has not changed, but Klein, whose occult has been introduced, is no longer as ignorant as before, recognizing the symbol of "storm." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailor...The sea otter...the storm...This is no problem... The color of the depth of the "downside down man" is purely a lot... ...he was promoted? By the way, what is the symbol behind my seat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein endured the urge, as before, tapping the edge of the long table three times, smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, Miss 'Justice', you are an extraordinary person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can he see it directly? Audrey took a moment and smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, thank you Mr. Fool, thank you Mr. Hangman."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s faster than I thought.” Alger Wilson said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t continue this topic, knocked on his eyebrows, and smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
