			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resurrection is a miracle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein suddenly thought of what happened to him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who shot himself committed a miraculous recovery of the head wound, and the extraordinary person who was crushed by the heart died out of the grave in the middle of the night. Isn't that just resurrected? Isn't this the "miracle" in the mouth of the leader of the seminar? The sequence of the "Divination" route 2 potion name is called "miracle"! At this moment, Klein vaguely felt that he had grasped the key things, but he couldn't piece together the clues that were not comprehensive enough to make the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have guessed before, I chose "Divination" as the beginning of the sequence and there are other factors at work... my biggest snuggle, fog This mysterious space on top just eliminates the interference and gives the divination family the most coveted environment... The characteristics of my "resurrection" seem to also originate from the fog...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When I came to Beckland, the involvement of the "Sister Master" Rosago was naturally attracted to me, in line with the extraordinary characteristics of the same way, the "quality", the suction The stronger, the intermittent function... The Antignus family notes suddenly changed the style, passing the key messages of the hidden treasures of the main peak of the Hornakis Mountains through the doomsday puppets, and perhaps there are also factors in this regard...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with other fragmentation phenomena, does it mean that this mysterious space has a very close relationship with the extraordinary way of "divination", and the corresponding sequence leaves "0" Level seal? Or, or the country of the legacy of the route sequence 0? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a possibility that the "divination" approach is called "uniqueness"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein took his eyes off Russell's diary and looked forward to seeing himself as a high-sequence strongman, and after discovering the glorious ladder deep in the fog, he could find something in the hidden place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the reason for my crossing and the way home can be found there...He suppresses the excitement of the heart, letting Russell’s diary from his own hands It disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he is increasingly alert to the leader of the Secret Society, Charato. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a powerful place for the "Divination" approach that has been a "miracle" for many years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, there are things that may hide his shadow behind them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thought is boiling in my mind, but Klein seems to have nothing to do as it happens:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"You start trading."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Foers immediately turned to look at the "Justice" lady on the same side, full of expectations :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have received a reply, my teacher has a pair of mirror dragon eyes, the price is 1,000 pounds."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following here, Fols is a bit embarrassed, because Dorian Gray Abraham’s psychological bottom line is 800 pounds, which is already a premium over the normal situation of five or six hundred pounds, and she On this basis, a total of two hundred pounds was added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After attending so many Tarot gatherings and various extraordinary circles, I finally understood a truth, as Russell said. In that way, money is not omnipotent, there is no money, nothing can be done...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the new book’s guarantee payment has already arrived, my deposit has 350 Pound, but there are also stomach bags of the spirits, as well as the various expenses of sequence 7, sequence 6, sequence 5, and even sequence 4... Mr. Fool’s vaguely revealed that the high sequence can completely get rid of the full moon. Curse... Even if there is a part to find a teacher, you can't rely solely on him and the Abraham family...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this respect, saving alone is not enough, you must work hard Make money...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The price of 1000 pounds is really expensive. If Miss Justice wants to pay the price, I will tell her later, after I have repeatedly tried, The teacher agreed to lower the price by 100 pounds..." Waiting for a reply, Fols comforted himself <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "1000 pounds? "Justice" Audrey did not expect to have the news of the "psychologist" potion material so soon, and subconsciously asked in a confirmed tone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for Firth to answer, she is pleased to add:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, deal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although she still owes a glimpse of the priest of Glylint, it is still 2,000 pounds for the "fool", but at the New Year's dance, she will officially declare her adulthood. Not only will the autonomy of property be much bigger than before, but also Received a lot of valuable gifts, for example, her father, Count Earl, promised a few days ago, and then dear daughter worth 50,000 pounds of Beckland Bank shares and more than 2,000 pounds of cash, so, 1000 The pound is not a number worthy of attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey was asked by Mr. "fool" at the beginning, hoping to extend the period of payment of 2,000 pounds to February and March, on the one hand, ready to pay off first The debt of the Viscount of Glylint, and the concealment of cash as much as possible, is unsuspecting, and on the other hand, extra budget for the material of the "psychologist" potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it’s time to use the budget! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At most, it’s like saving money for a few months, and after March, there’s nothing wrong with it! Audrey thought without thinking annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agree? Promise... "Magic" Firth is happy and awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requesting Mr. "Footer" to witness the transaction, agreeing that Miss "Justice" will pay first, and after delivering the extraordinary materials on Wednesday, Fols decided to get cash. Go straight to Port Pritz, without wasting time in the middle, while looking at the three men: "Sun", "Put Hang" and "World":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a stomach bag for the spirited?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After feeling calm, she found herself with the experience of playing the law, and there was no excessive amount of extraordinary characteristics. Next, the progress of digestion is much faster than expected, and the week is almost equal to the past two weeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For another ten days, she will be able to completely digest the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When collecting materials and promoting them to "Master of Juggling", she felt that she should be able to get the perfect test through the first test given by teacher Dorian. The emphasis is no longer just on the students who are accepted because of gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am trying to tell you this During the exploration process, we have harvested some stomach bags from the spirits. I can exchange them at a low price after returning to Silver City, provided that I am no longer monitored."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, but you don't seem to be able to use the Golden Pound?" Fols asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After saving the little "Sun" action, she already had a preliminary understanding of Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the "sun" opening, "downside down" Alger interjected:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can give me the corresponding banknote or gold coin, 300 pounds. This is a very reasonable price, and I will show the 'Sun God Official''s potion formula to the 'Sun'."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. inverted man, do you have the formula of 'Sun God Official'?" Dairik surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In previous patrols and recent explorations, he increasingly felt that the ability of the "sun" approach was well suited to dealing with the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the "Giant" route sequence 6 "Dawn Knight" has been able to make a morning light, but in the sacred and bright field, it is still not as good as "Prayer!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&#;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had previously found the potion formula of the "Sun God Officer" in the secret treasure of the Rhodes Islands parish, but until recently, he had found a good opportunity, with enough justification and enough The permission to meet the condition was reviewed once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that there is a guy on the sea of ​​Sunia who is suspected of being a pastor of the eternal blazing sun. He seems to be temporarily unable to return to the Republic of Intis, only here. Looking for the potion material corresponding to the "Sun God Official", and the hatred of the eternal sun, can only make the news of the rumor into the action basis of the storm church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
