			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too fast...Is it already a few laps around the planet...or it’s always in place, just too fast, my sight is completely Not... Klein’s mouth is slightly pumped, and it’s decided to wait a few seconds to see if the “imaginary quick guy” will still appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not worried that the spiritual creature summoned will harm the innocent, because one of the descriptions is a friendly creature, and as long as he forces the end of the summoning, the suspension ceremony Anyway, no matter where the "imaginary fast" goes, it will be sent back to the spiritual world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, Klein, who hadn’t waited for anything, took a breath and said in ancient Hermes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I ended this summoning in my name! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding Mori cold disappeared instantly, the swirling smog gradually subsided, and the candle's flare returned to normal color.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stepped forward and extinguished the candlelight, intending to modify the last sentence description and make a second attempt.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for The spirit in the illusory, the friendly creature that can be driven," he does not intend to change, the first sentence points to the spiritual world, can only be synonymous replacement, change or not change, the second sentence is Klein The premise of ensuring your own safety, otherwise it is not a funny accident, but a horror story.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well...do not "beyond imagination" to modify "rapid people" But others don't necessarily meet my needs. Maybe... you can change your mind. The messenger doesn't have to run so fast. Normally, there are other ways to protect security. Just let those who are malicious always ignore it. It’s okay to pay attention to it... This time, try to have a spiritual creature that doesn’t feel strong... Klein has considered two Minutes, the ceremony was held again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the pre-work, he missed a new mantra:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I call in my name:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spirit that lingers in vain, A friendly creature driven by, a weak being that is easily overlooked. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warehouse suddenly became very quiet, there was no wind in the wall of the spirituality, no cold, and even the color of the candle did not change.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein waited patiently, watching, hoping to get a good messenger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten seconds He sighed and looked around: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, this description doesn't work." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer waits, ends the call according to the process, extinguishes the candle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him Slightly puzzling, the flame of the candle finally swayed a few times.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t ignore anything... Klein’s brow wrinkled, and immediately stretched, This matter has been left behind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He re-thinks how to modify the description of the problem, still for the third sentence.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More ideas, if the messenger is particularly capable and survivable, it is okay. Anyway, the letter that can send the letter to the target is a good messenger... Klein has been indulging for a while. The third time, the summoning ceremony was held.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scent of herbs and essential oils, under the faint yellow candlelight, the shadows on his face floated, his mouth was indefinite: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I call in my name:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spirit that lingers in vain, A friendly creature driven by, a superb survivor with great survivability. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Kline's vision, a white bone was drilled from the ground and stacked together to form a safe-type creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally summoned what you can see, and it’s the kind of survivability... It’s like a safe, it’s very good at first glance. ... Klein breathed a sigh of relief, using the ancient Hermes language: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to be my messenger?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone-like creature of the same box quickly gave a willingness to be willing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, it squirmed the white bone below and climbed over to Klein, slowly and slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It climbed a centimeter in ten seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......This is too slow... Kline’s smile is stiff on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although messengers accomplish their mission by shuttle through the spirit world, it does not mean that they do not need speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spiritual world, distance and direction are chaotic, and the most important thing is positioning and finding positioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as accurate, clear, and immediate positioning is provided, such as the summoning ceremony just now, for example, a copper whistle equivalent to a simplified ritual, regardless of the messenger Which position in the spiritual world can appear in the altar immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the positioning is not so immediate, only the contract link or the previous anchor point, the messenger needs to spend time to distinguish the positioning, travel the spirit world, find the target, this must have A certain speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it sends a letter, the recipient may not be able to wait until this time... Klein looks at the safe-type white bone creature that climbed slowly, and he wants to feel helpless. Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let the smile just reappear on the face:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After careful thinking, I I think I can't bother you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your will. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature of the illusory bones stopped, just like it was just before.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quickly lifted the call and smashed the forehead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a bit frustrated at the moment, decided to give up on himself, looking for a messenger in a less troublesome way, that It’s “open recruitment, interview selection”!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a breath, Klein calmed his mind and held the ceremony seriously.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the burning candle, he stepped back:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I call in my name:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spirit that lingers in vain, Friendly creatures driven by, willing to be the unique existence of my messenger. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wall of spirituality, the wind is fierce, Klein's half-high silk The hat was almost vacated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candle swayed and swelled to the size of the human head, pale to the point of losing temperature.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A translucent head is as slow as a breakthrough film, with light gold and smooth hair, and the eyes are scarlet and bloody, and the appearance is bright and beautiful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;It’s a bit familiar... Klein whispered silently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head was completely drilled, but the back was not the neck, but the pinch of her The illusory palm of the tail.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the palm, it is a cuff that is complex but dark in color.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;This is really a familiar "person", the headless woman who stood on the top of the castle when Klein went to the bottom of the Kavitua. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is no longer as big as before, comparable to the castle, she is now just a tall, "ordinary" lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, her neck is still only incision, with four identical heads in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." "You..." "Summoning..." "I?" The headless woman in a dark, complex black dress stood there quietly. The four heads that hang down are opened in turn, using the ancient Fossack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can communicate directly in language...The level of this spiritual creature is not low...I remember you have a castle...there are industries, how come?" Apply for a messenger? Klein first felt, then spit, and then looked at the candlelight behind the headless woman, disappointed to find that no other souls came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally thought that there would be a lot of spiritual creatures who are willing to be their messengers, rushing into rows, waiting for an interview. As a result, there is only one responder. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be a question of the ceremony itself, which is a simpler and junior summoning ritual. It is impossible to summon multiple targets at once... Klein looks at that person. Ms. Wutou, Zheng focuses on the head: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't wait for the other person to speak, He added two more questions:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you swim in the spirit world faster? How is your ability to survive?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the headless woman replied in turn: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." "Alright..." "Good "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she spoke, she floated up and quickly fell down and showed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein decided not to try to know what would happen, seriously asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to sign a contract and become my messenger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headless woman's skirt is fretting, and the four heads of blonde red eyes nod at the same time: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." "Every time..." "One..." "Gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;what? Send a letter to a gold coin? Mr. Azke did not say that there are such hobbies in the spiritual world... Yes, he mentioned that when signing a contract, try to persuade and communicate as much as possible. Is this a form of persuasion and communication? Klein was surprised to want to lift the call immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, not necessarily by me... Who summoned the messenger who paid the money... Hey, maybe after the communication is better, there is still to pay this Option... Thoughts, the Kline agreed to the other party's request:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will sign the contract. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the dark red round pen and the yellow-brown parchment that had been prepared for a long time, and wrote it quickly with the ancient Hermes, which can shake the natural forces. The contract.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The format and terms are detailed in Azick’s letter, concise and powerful, including the messenger can not peek into the letter, discard the letter, Harm the life of the contractor, of course, if the contractor’s letter involves the messenger, he must explain it to the other party in advance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these contents, Klein also added The term of a letter of gold coin, and clearly stated that it can be borne by the contractor or by the other party.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure the validity of the contract, the last part is the domain of the gods The name of the name.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a necrotic contract. Normally, the name of the god of death must be used, but the god of death has been degraded for a long time, no longer has any response. So Azick mentioned that it can be replaced by the description of the high-ranking person in the field of the dead or the underworld itself, only about Forces are not so strong <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
