"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the notes and nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dickwellton relaxed a lot, just like the drowning man finally caught the lifebuoy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After more than half an hour, in the "Tiana" hotel, Dakwell looked at the powerful adventurer, German Sparrow, on the front of the night:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change to a deluxe suite. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Klein stepped back two steps and seemed to be giving the position to the fat pharmacist.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Dakwell swallowed his mouth and hesitated to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pay? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" During the mission, all expenses are borne by the employer, which is the rule of the adventurer. Klein responded without changing his color.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe you are stupid! Do you call a few "red theater" girls, I have to replace them. You pay? Dirkwell thought about it and squeezed his smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can use only one ordinary room, which is more convenient to protect. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you can live by yourself." "Klein effortlessly played by Gelman Sparrow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkwell haha ​​laughed twice and walked over to the counter, no expression Said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A deluxe suite. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the real stay, after entering the smaller bedroom, fat pharmacist Dakwell opened the window and left the "door" for Mr. Harry, while The ring box inside the pocket, check the condition of the strange dice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirm that the dice are the same as before, four points up, no change, Da Kewei Er quietly vomited.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, an ordinary Inside the house.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ins. Zangweier wakes up from a deep sleep, the first reaction is to confirm his condition.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what he repeats every day, because he has no way of knowing what story the "0-08" will weave and what kind of accident it will bring after she falls asleep.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that he was not injured, Inz Zangweier put on his bright leather boots and stood up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He did not expect to see 0—08” is quietly placed on the desk, as if it is the most common and most common feather pen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it was locked in a night last night. There are layers of symbolic symbols and magical signs in the metal tweezers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ins. Zangweier walked away with dignity and held "0-08" in one hand. I opened the notebook next to me and found that there was more than one page of text:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ince Zangweier did not think that he did last night. What happened, but he was keenly aware of some problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He looked down and saw obvious abnormalities in his nails, but he couldn't remember what he did last night..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading In this description, Ings Zangweier instinctively looked at the full-length mirror in the room, only to see that he still licked his eyes, the classical sculpture-like face did not have a trace of wrinkles, but his mouth position remained With a little smile, it is in stark contrast to the dignified gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Ins. Zangweier felt that his face was a little blue, and the bottom of his eyes was black, and he was matched with the smile that he did not know how to appear. The whole looks very gloomy, hot and strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hands, lowered his head, and saw a piece of black sludge that had dried up in his nails. It seemed to go to the garden in the middle of the night to plan the roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has been transferred from the "Death" route to the "Night" route, becoming a "night watchman", but Inns Zangweier has not lost The extraordinary ability of the past is still a powerful psychic, a mentor in the field of the dead, so he immediately intends to communicate the spirit inside and outside the house to understand what happened last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, his eyes were aimed at the last paragraph of the notebook:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ince Zangweier tried to psychic, but sadly found that he had no gains. It seems that the same professional has dealt with all the clues. He is worried that he does not know what he was involved in last night. Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ins. Zangweier’s expression became more and more condensed, trying to make a psychic, and unexpectedly did not get any surprises. result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday morning, the behind-the-scenes boss has replaced the Fragrant Leaf Bar outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein went to a secluded alley and saw U.Kent carrying a small suitcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your bounty." Us Kent threw the not-so-big suitcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually not a real bounty, it is a military advancement - the former involves the Governor's Office and the Kingdom's finances, there are many processes to go, at least three Days can be completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein caught the suitcase and opened it on the spot, seeing a stack of neat banknotes, mainly 1 pound and 5 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A total of 5,400 pounds, did not draw." Us Kent forcibly laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For another adventurer, he gave at most 4,000 pounds, and the rest is the income of a series of people on the link. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the opposite is a crazy guy, the strength is closer to the pirate general, afraid that he was forced to work on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military should not lie to me with fake money... Klein grabbed a stack of banknotes and shook it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5400 pounds... Dakwell hiding outside the alley heard the words of Usk Kent, sneaked at the suitcase and was filled with texture A stack of gold pounds squinted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the first time he saw so much money put together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The adventurer is really a profitable profession. Hunting a pirate has a few thousand pounds, protecting me three days of income of 1,000 pounds plus one request, and occasionally Find the shipwreck and the treasure... Why should I be a pharmacist, not an adventurer? I should know that I should choose the lucky way to get there..." Dirkwell thought enviously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he quickly remembered the reality that most of the adventurers are actually not so rich, even if they can make a fortune, there are three points. One of the incomes also has to contribute to the pharmacist, not to treat the injury, to eliminate the old problem, is to buy medicine to help, to deal with hidden diseases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still doing pharmacist safety... Dirkwell sighed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, did not carefully count the amount of Klein to close the suitcase, to Us. Kent said:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to leave Beyam?" Ust Kent slightly asked in a strange way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take a bodyguard mission."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Us. Kent first stunned, and immediately emerged an inexplicable sense of ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the madman looks forward to seeing in Yayam, one day it will cause a big deal, or go to the sea and fight the pirates better... S. Kent immediately smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can report it directly and attach my address, the telegraph office has our people."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Klein, wearing a black coat, didn't say much, put on the suitcase and turned away from the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went with Dirkwell and headed straight to the port area, preparing to take the first passenger liner to Olav Island, and the owl flew across the street trees Sneaky, sneaky - they bought black tickets last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half an hour before boarding the ship, Dakwell was quite tormented, and the person who was afraid of selling the teacher suddenly rushed and attacked himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentiment has been maintained until he enters his first class cabin - as long as the passenger liner enters the sea, it is difficult for the extraordinary person who does not have the ability to fly or his own vessel Intercepted halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get on the boat, get off the boat..." Dirkwell looked out the window and muttered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the owl had followed and stopped at his left shoulder, and Klein sat in the chair of the room, guarding for possible attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sky is becoming bleak and the wind is getting stronger and stronger, and the humidity in the air is obviously rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a storm?" Dakwell blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the vessel may not sail on time, maybe for a few hours! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that, Dirkwell will suffer a lot of unnecessary risks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to look at German Sparrow, smirking out: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing, for example, you immediately pray to "Poseidon" Cavitowa, and I immediately respond to the fog , to dispel the storm ... but no doubt, after a few minutes or even tens of seconds, "Sea King" Yann Courtman will come over, and his attack will be even earlier... Klein looked at the fat pharmacist Respond calmly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just an adventurer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell knows I really shouldn’t have unnecessary expectations. I sneak into the weather, turn back to my body, and let my head out of the window to study the specific situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver flashlight slammed down and hit Dirkwell straight before Klein responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dickwellton twitched and fell down, smoking, skin scorching, electric snakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was almost stunned, and this was the first time he saw someone being struck by lightning in a thunderstorm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too bad luck... He forgot to rescue Dakwell for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owl Mr. Harry also took a few seconds and then screamed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry, Fast! There is a bottle of medicine in the second pocket on his left, feed him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This owl can talk...Kline picks his eyebrows, In the first few steps, he bent down his body and found the bottle of blood red medicine, then forced it into Dakwell's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
