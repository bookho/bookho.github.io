			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, Klein sat down and took out the "Black Emperor" card that melted into the spirit, and instantly changed back to its original appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is called a one-button dressup... He spits on himself and remembers what happened just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is almost certain that the "giant" wearing the spire tower is the "King of the Five Seas" Nast, the hundred meters that can sail in the spiritual world The sailing ship is the ghost ship "Black Emperor" made by the ancient Solomon Empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I always thought that the ghost ship simply means that you can sail on your own, will not sink, closer to a strange creature, I did not expect, the most powerful and most The top ghost ship can also blur yourself and roam the spirit world...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is almost equivalent to a demigod? It is worthy of the most famous 'Black Emperor' on the five oceans, um... does not rule out the possibility of a traveller living in the manufacturing process...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" One of the most famous treasures, the ship's ghost empire, which carries the last legacy of the Trentino Empire, has similar capabilities, so it cannot be found?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's thoughts drifted a little bit, and did not have the first time to think about the sudden encounter with the "King of the Five Seas" Nast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very obvious thing: the extraordinary feature aggregation rule! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the "Black Emperor" card itself does not contain extraordinary characteristics, but Russell did not know what was added or inscribed during the production, resulting in the holder's promotion After the sequence, you can use this card to create subtle sensations with the extraordinary materials you need. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar inductions are undoubtedly mutual, and when they are sensed, they are naturally sensed by others, and before the holder crosses the demigod ladder It is manifested in the fate of unconsciously approaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point, Klein has a deep understanding, he always suspects that the existence of fog makes some extraordinary people or supernatural events gather around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roaming with the 'Black Emperor' brand is more likely to lead to similar situations than in reality, because the real world has to follow many rules, even if there is a fate The traction has to be logical, a little bit unfolding, not to say that I used the 'Black Emperor' card in Beckland, and the 'King of the Five Seas' Nast can immediately take the ghost ship and appear in front of me... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if he can detect the kind of traction, he has to go through the process of determining the position and moving through the spiritual world. It has been a few hours or even days. If you can't detect it, you will only naturally think about sailing to the Sea of ​​Sonia and approaching the border of the Kingdom of Ron. In this case, it may not be possible for months or years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the spirit world, 'things' is simple, there is no distinction between high and low, high and low, the location and distance are very chaotic, 'the king of the five seas 'Nast may just want to go to the spiritual world to take the wind, and as soon as I enter, I see that I pass by, this does not need to comply with the constraints and restrictions of the actual geographical location." Klein thoughtfully tapped the mottled long table the edge of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, he is very certain that he can’t control the “Black Emperor” and cast it to the “King of the Five Seas”. Nast is not because of the aggregation of extraordinary characteristics. The law, the effect of this aspect is reflected in fate, induction and craving, not so exaggerated, otherwise there will be no high sequence strong, and all of them will be involuntarily absorbed by the "uniqueness" of this route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein feels that it is an extraordinary force that distorts and reinforces its forward intentions, causing it to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very simple judgment. At that time, even if I throw out the "Black Emperor" card, I can’t stop it... This is a "lawyer", that is, "black." The extraordinary power of the emperor's approach? Klein leaned back against the back of the chair and decided not to use the "Black Emperor" card in the near future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that he can’t roam the spirits and look for messengers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If he does not carry the "Black Emperor" card, holding the "Poseidon Scepter" in the form of the body is full of various information and enlightenment in the spiritual world. The presence of a place will inevitably leave a lot of clues, and there is always the possibility of being divined. On the anti-Divination anti-prophecy, the Aziz copper whistle is incomparable to the "Black Emperor" card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really want to do that, maybe I go to the bar to buy a beer, I will meet ten people who know that I took the "Poseidon Scepter"... Of course, What does Klein Moretti have to do with my German Sparrow? Klein ridiculed his head and decided to use a ritual method to get a messenger emergency and find a more suitable one in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He covered the "Black Emperor" card and the figure disappeared into the mysterious space above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Byam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger is ready to take the carriage out of the city and detour to the private port behind the cliff - his "Blue Avenger" is docked there, waiting for the flight . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a pirate captain in disguise, he could not park the boat directly to the main port of the "generous city", which would fully explain that he is close to the official Contact, the same is true for other pirates. Before coming to Baiam to sell or enjoy, you must consider the location of the parking in advance, either to the small port in the surrounding waters or to the private port controlled by the background or the rebel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no task, you can leave the port...get a magical item first, you can strengthen your strength, you can make a flat account, then go to the original The island, the hunting blue shadow, as soon as possible to the sequence 6 ... Alger just went to a rental carriage, but unexpectedly saw a familiar figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former pirate trader, Ralph, ruthlessly walked down the carriage and looked at the Governor’s Office not far away, the whole person was irritating . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to him? Alger was puzzled for a moment and took the initiative to say hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, in a sense, Ralph is also his own peer, and is a subordinate of Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one is a core member and one is a peripheral organization... Alger calmly determines the identity and position of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to be happy?" After the cold weather, Alger took the initiative to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relph Haha laughed and squeezed his eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said to me Feel the care of the gods, do you believe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe... Alger did not hesitate to answer a question in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suppressed curiosity and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing here?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relph is about to answer, his eyes suddenly brighten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks around and confirms that there are no ones around, and he is quiet.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not saying Believe in God?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger originally tried to deal with him and lied that he also had a certain belief in Poseidon. Anyway, this is quite normal between pirates. It won't be suspicious—on the sea, the horrible weather is often more terrible than the enemy, so most pirates, adventurers, crews, and sailors have a great fear of controlling the gods in similar fields. Letter a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Alger answered this time more than ever before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he knows that the other god’s belief in "Poseidon" is the embodiment of "Folly". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relph nodded with satisfaction, smiled and whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I got the god yesterday Oh, God asked me to help his young lambs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I intend to establish a charity fund for this purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the will of God. As a believer, I think you will be happy to provide some help."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He explores his right hand and waits for a donation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger’s expression was stiff and he didn’t know how to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His current wealth has reached 3,245 pounds, but it is prepared to buy a magical item, the overall situation is not at all plentiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the provincial province can still donate a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
