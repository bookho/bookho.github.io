			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are extraordinary factors..." Klein's twilight returned to normal, looking sideways at Leonard and Frye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard suddenly laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Professional, it is a divination. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You seem to imply what... Klein snorted without a voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frye opened the suitcase and took out the silver knife and other things for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The body told me that she did die from a sudden heart disease... Do you have a way to divinate in more detail?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean seriously nodded :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can try the combination of the 'Psychic' ritual and the 'dream divination', hoping to get something from Mrs. Lavis's remaining spirituality. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frye keeps the cold and restrained state and retreats two steps:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You try it first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Klein with a slight look, and suddenly he sighed without undulating: "You are getting used to such an occasion." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to... Klein has the urge to cry, take out the pure dew, essential oils and herbal powders that I need to use, and quickly complete the " The arrangement of the psychic ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He silently recites the name of the goddess of the night in the center of the wall of spirituality, and prays in Hemyth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, there was a wind swirling around him, and the light became more and more bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already a black Klein seize the opportunity to repeat the divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mrs. Lawless’s death.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mrs. Lauvis’s cause of death.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the dream, "seeing" seeing the ambiguity in the blur, the transparent spirit around the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he stretched out his illusory right hand and touched the spirituality left to Mrs. Lawless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, there was light and shadow in front of him, and there was a picture flashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a woman with a thin face and a tattered dress who is busy with a matchbox;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That was when she suddenly paused and grabbed her chest;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is she is talking to two children;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is her body swaying, gasping; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was when she went to buy brown bread, she was suddenly taken a shot; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the symptom of her heart problem again and again;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is what she feels Very tired, lying on the bed, but never woke up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein carefully observed every detail and tried to find traces of the existence of extraordinary factors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when it is over, he still hasn’t got enough clear clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuzzy and broken, Klein withdraws from dreams and returns to reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted the wall of spirituality, waiting for Frye and Leonard to watch the show:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There is no direct symbol. Most of the pictures reveal that Mrs. Lawless has suffered from heart disease. Only one person is different from the others. Mrs. Lauves was photographed from behind, and the hand was white and slender. It seems that Belongs to women."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For such a family, when it is not the worst, it will not be easy to see a doctor, even if it is only queued at a free charity medical organization, time can not afford to lose, they do not work one day, maybe the next day There is no food." Leonard sighed with a poet's sentimental tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frye looked at the corpse on the bed and gave a soft breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Klein spoke, Leonard quickly switched state, as if thinking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What do you mean, the extraordinary factor exists in Mrs. Lavis's photograph, from the lady or woman with a slender hand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Klein nodded and answered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but this is only my interpretation, divination is often ambiguous."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Leonard did not discuss again, each retreated to the other side of the floor, allowing Frye to remove the auxiliary equipment and materials from the luggage without any interference, for further inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They waited for a moment, Frye packed all sorts of things, cleaned up and covered them, and turned around and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cause of death is a natural heart disease, there is no doubt about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this conclusion, Leonard took a few steps back and forth, even I walked to the door and talked for a long time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First come here, we go to the Western District Almshouse to see if we can find other clues and see two deaths. Can you connect in tandem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, only this way." Klein, who was full of doubts, agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fleet on the suitcase, half-bounce through two grounds, did not step on the quilt of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard opened the door and took the lead to go to Lawrence and the tenant:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You can go home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought, added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The body should not be rushed to bury, wait another day, maybe there will be a thorough inspection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, good, police officer." Lauvi Si Wei bowed his body and replied in a hurry. Then he was half numb and said awkwardly. "Actually, I have no money to bury her for a while. I have to wait a few days, a few days, but fortunately, the weather is cool recently. the "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Klein surprised blurting out: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;". you intend to stay in the room well corpse A few days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lewis squeezed a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, okay Fortunately, the weather is cool recently. You can put the body on the table at night, when you eat. , To hold her to bed ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; he would not finish, Fry suddenly interrupted: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cost of my burial is next to your wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he left such a plain words, did not pay attention to it. Weis’s horrified expression and the gratitude that followed, quickly walked to the door of the apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is following closely, thinking about a problem:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the weather remains How will Lawrence treat his wife's body in the heat of June and July? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking for a very dark night, secretly throwing the body into the Tasok River, Hoy River? Or just find a place to dig a pit and bury it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein knows that "it must be buried in the cemetery" is more than a thousand years ago, in the end of the last era, the seven churches and the royal rooms in order to reduce And eliminate the laws specifically formulated by water ghosts, zombies and grievances. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific implementation method is to provide free land by countries, each church is responsible for guarding or patrolling, and only charge a small fee in the cremation and funeral to pay the necessary labor Pay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even so, the real poor are still somewhat unaffordable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the 134th Street of Iron Cross Street, the three nights were separated from Beech-Mount Barton and silently turned to the West District Almshouse in the nearby streets. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After approaching there, Klein saw a long queue lined up, just like the situation in the big red goods shop on the earth. People, people crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are more than one hundred, no, close to two hundred people." He whispered awkwardly, seeing the queues were worn out, numb, and occasionally anxiously Looking at the door of the poor house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frye slowed down, temperament cold and gloomy said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every poor house The number of homeless poor people who can be accepted every day is limited and can only be selected in the order of queuing. Of course, the almshouse will do the identification to prevent people who do not meet the conditions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This also has factors that have been sluggish in recent months..." Leonard exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "People who are not ranked can only find their own way?" Klein asked subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They can also go to other poor houses to try their luck. The time for opening different gates is different. However, there will be the same long team, some people, It was waiting at two in the afternoon." Freyton said, "The rest of the people will be hungry for a day, so they will lose the ability to find a job, and fall into a vicious circle of death, unable to withstand. People will give up their insistence on kindness..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein silently spoke for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The newspaper never publishes these...Mr. Frye, I rarely hear you say so much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to be poor in the goddess The hospital has been a pastor." Frye is still in that cold state. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well-dressed three people arrived at the gate of the Western District Apocalypse, and presented the documents to the janitor who was arrogantly lining up the queue, and was introduced into the almshouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This almshouse was transformed from an old church, with a cushion in the hall and a hammock hanging from it. The foot odor stuffed every corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many homeless people outside the hall, some of them are wielding hammers, breaking stones, and some are picking up thin lines from the old ropes. One person is free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to prevent the poor from relying on relief, it became a rogue. The 1336 "Poverty Alleviation Law" stipulates that each poor can only stay in the poor house for up to five days. If they are over, they will be driven out. In the past five days, they also have to work, knocking stones or picking up ropes. This is also an inevitable item for the criminals in the prison." Frye did not bring Klein and Renner with any emotion. Germany introduced two sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard opened his mouth and eventually said it was ridiculous or stated: "If you leave this almshouse, you can go to another one. Of course, you may not be able to I lived in it... Oh, maybe in some people’s eyes, the poor are equal to the criminals.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“...take the ropes?” Klein was silent for a while. I don't know what to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fibers in the old rope are a good material to fill the gaps in the ship." Frye stopped and found traces of blackened ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They waited for a few minutes, and the dean and pastor of the almshouse came over, all men in their 40s. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Saws is arson here, and only burned himself?" Leonard pointed to the trace of the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dean of the almshouse is a man with a wide forehead and a slight convexity. He used a blue eyelid to follow the direction of Mitchell’s inspector, sure Nod: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before this, what did Sols have? Abnormal performance?" Klein added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dean of the Poor Institute thought for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the person sleeping next to him Sols has been chanting 'The Lord abandoned me', 'The world is too filthy and too dirty', 'I have nothing,' and other words, full of resentment and despair, but no one thought that he actually I plan to let everyone fall asleep, break all the kerosene lamps, set fire to it, thank the Lord, and someone discovers and stops his evil deeds in time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
