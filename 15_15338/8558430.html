			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, Klein leaned back on the high back chair and held "squirming hunger" for a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he released the soul of the "psychologist" according to the predetermined steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of the bronze long table quickly showed a tall figure. This is a lady, her face is rather vague, and the feeling of pain and distortion is beyond words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at her and asked like a chat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember who you are? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this mysterious space, he can directly psychic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "psychologist" has a lot of grievances, and smiles bitterly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I remember.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a member of a secret organization, I am going to see a friend in Tosta, and I met a pirate on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I used my ability to solve the disaster, the pirates who escaped told the situation to Zillingus, in order to get my Ability, deliberately changed the sailing plan, blocked our vessel, and you should be able to imagine the following things.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By benefiting from his caution, I was directly Killing, not like other female passengers, is more terrible than death. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein silently for a few seconds, tapped his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know Is this ancient book of Russell's Travels? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks that since "Grossel's Travels" comes from the dragon family, the "psychologists" may have heard of its name and specific circumstances.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female "psychologist" seriously thought about it and shook her head and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I I have never heard of this name. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't entangle this topic any more and instead asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are about to dissipate , to get peace, what is the last wish? "The doctor" lowered his head and chuckled: "<br /><br /> . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I know that this wish cannot be satisfied, and the other is not necessary. I have been dead for many years. My family and my friends should have already received it. When it comes to bad news, passing on the death message will only remind them of the pain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That, thank you, just like this..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She’s figure is bleak and faint, disappearing, leaving only a huge golden pupil, reflecting the golden pupils of everyone’s thoughts.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an extraordinary feature left by the “psychologist.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sighed and pondered the words of the “psychologist” Some details: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She visited friends in Toskat Island, alone, without relatives...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Toscat Island is located in the easternmost part of the Sea of ​​Sonia, and south and north of the Gargas Islands.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is Lun Easternmost country colony, while Gargas Islands belong Fu Sake Empire ...... what friends will be there? What friends are worth visiting for so long? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although she only said that it is a secret organization, but the probability is a 'psychological alchemy', is this a task?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein respects the deceased and is unwilling to dig into the secrets of the other party, so there is no question, and naturally there is no clue. He quickly stopped thinking about this and considered another thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hunting the "smartwriter" Misole Kim, I have to leave Baiam in a short period of time for whatever reason... During this time, I really did not do this "generous city". Less things... Well, to participate in two or three extraordinary gatherings, to confirm whether there is a master material of the "Master of Secrets" and then leave... Klein quickly made a decision, and then there was a scene of "world" prayer, giving It was covered in fog and thrown into the deep red star symbolizing Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey is looking out at the nearby village on the balcony on the third floor. The roof there is dominated by brick red, depicting a realistic or abstract dragon pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a familiar, flawless fog emerged from her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fog, a vague figure is praying to the god above the stilts:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. 'Folly Fool', please tell Miss 'Justice', you can prepare for the transaction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I prepare for the transaction? Did he get the extraordinary characteristics of a "psychologist"? Yesterday, there was no... The efficiency of the "world" was scared to Audrey, and I almost forgot to thank Mr. "Folly". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, she was not the young girl in the past, she has seen a lot of big things, quickly calmed down, sincerely thanked and told the world "Sir, I have to wait two to three days because she is going to pay the money that owes Mr. "The Fool" to her. The cash on her is enough, but it must be kept at a certain bottom line, otherwise it will be easy to be discovered. wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the illusory fog dissipated, Audrey looked down at Su Shi, who was quietly admiring the garden on the first floor, and took a few steps back and forth, secretly swearing. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. 'World' is really terrible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, "Seaweed Bar". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue-eyed Mies, who just squandered the money from the casino, sat in front of the bar and asked for a cup of violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is about to raise a glass of wine, and suddenly he hears that the bartender is low: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The speaker 'Missor is dead.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...who did it?" "Blue Eyes" Mises was shocked and immediately asked excitedly. Tao, "Someone is challenging the disease?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An adventurer named German Sparo, who had no previous reputation, who Knowing that I can get rid of Misor!” The bartender did not hide his vibrations and horror. “He killed Ozl, the real boss of the fragrant leaf bar, 'Gilez' Ozl.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blue Eyes" Mies was about to express his feelings and suddenly frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, Ozl’s people came to ask him about the “flame” Daniz, and he told the other party that the “Golden Dream” sailor Mixed with an unfamiliar adventurer and with the help of rituals, the corresponding portraits are provided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ozil is dead, Misor. Kim is dead, a strange adventurer named German Sparo..."Blue Eyes "Mis's hand trembled a little, and the picture that made him impressed to the extreme instantly appeared in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man who looks like a gentleman stands At the entrance to the bar, the black-brown, black-faced, thin-faced, angular, and eagerly looking at the alcoholic people coming and going, it seems to be looking for prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blue Eyes" Mises shuddered, refused to drink, straight up and strode out of the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s terrible, that guy is terrible! Even the "smart speaker" died in his hands, definitely the strongman of the general level! He must be looking for me, to kill me together, no, can't stay in Baiam, must return to the boat immediately, stay away from here! "Blue Eye" Mies went straight to the "Red Theater", forcibly pulled away several companions, went to the jungle outside the city, and detoured to rebel against the private port controlled by the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Red Theatre" diagonally opposite the alley in the alley is still open, fat pharmacist Dirkwell sitting at the counter, calm appearance, inner anxiety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has contacted the known "life school" members in various ways to seek the necessary help, but he can't know who will come, when he will come, can only endure fear and anxious to continue to open the store, pretending that nothing happened. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dakwell, you are very upset." The chubby owl didn't know where to fly back and landed on the counter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't need your reminder, I know my status very well." Dirkwell waved his hand impatiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still remembers that when he followed the teacher, he was always warned by the other party to be careful of the official organization to be careful about the real blood. For this reason, Roy Kim gave a lot of For example, what is permanently held in the ground, neither seeing the sun nor women, what is a researcher, using the body to test the harm of certain seals, what is going through various experiments, mutating into a monster with only instinct, what? Was taken by the blood family, turned into a mole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These examples are deeply imprinted in the mind of the fat man, so that the courage he lacked has disappeared directly. After leaving the teacher, he always stays in a city for a while. , leave immediately after exposure to risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell strives to converge on fear and shift his attention to the question of how to save the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The old man has been arrested for some time. Why is it still in the Governor’s Office? With the military’s ability, the intelligence to be clarified should have been made early. It is clear that whether it is a direct execution, harvesting materials, or being placed in a researcher, the old man must have been transferred... Is the old man using any means to conceal the secret, or do they want the old man to become a spy? Hey, agree directly!" Dakwell scratched his hair and his thoughts spread out infinitely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, he thought of his last communication with teacher Roy Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old man always likes to give hints in places that look ordinary and ordinary. Will there be similar information in the letter? The letter is not What to say, I agreed to meet near the Red Theater and show off his gambling skills. Hey, obviously by luck, he also asked me to go to the Marpel grocery store on Enmat Street to buy a donkey and accept it. Preparation for education... I thought about waiting to meet and buy again. I haven’t been there. Maybe there is a secret there?” Dirkwell was like a drowning man who had the last straw to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Baiyam Many streets are named after the city of the Kingdom of Lun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell took courage in a few minutes, took the owl, closed the store door, and walked out of the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While waiting for the rental of the carriage, he bought a newly published "News" from the newsboy and boringly looked at the international and domestic news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw a familiar face, and that was the adventurer who told him the whereabouts of Roy Kim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German Sparo, at noon, killed the 'smartwriter' Missour Gold, who has a reward of up to 5,400 pounds... I turned out to be Entrusted such a powerful adventurer!" Dirkwell snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly threw the matter behind his head, got on the rental carriage, went straight to Enmat Street and found the Mapel grocery store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner is a well-behaved elderly lady who looks up and down Dakwell a few times:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The dice you need is worth £1."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are robbing! Dirkwell snorted in his heart, but it made him more certain that the scorpion might have hidden clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay money, he took a small ring box, opened the lid and saw a milky white six-faced scorpion, the number of points facing up was red 4 o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is doubtful that this scorpion is very common, and the ring box is full, there is almost no gap, but Dirkwell is cautiously not on the spot to study, will It broke into the pocket and went to the other side of the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came to the secluded place, he couldn’t help but take a look and didn’t think there was any problem with the blind man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a carriage drove past, scared him, and his wrist shook, dropping the scorpion to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dice continued to scroll and eventually stopped, with the red 1 point up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
