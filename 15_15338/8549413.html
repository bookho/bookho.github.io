			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the stairs, back to the reception hall, Klein just said goodbye to Roshan, I heard the brown-haired girl said softly:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The captain asked you to come over again on Monday to deal with the chores at home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...OK." Klein didn't expect the management of the night squad to be so human, and he was a little grateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was going to get up early tomorrow, and he was going to do the job of "sloshing" this morning, go to the University of Tingen and find the instructor responsible for the interview. After saying that he did not participate in the follow-up session, after all, the original owner took the recommendation letter of the instructor before entering the interview. No matter what, there is a basic courtesy from the beginning to the end. Even if you don't consider it yourself, you must respect the mentor's feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is no telephone, the telegram is charged by a single letter, and the mail is obviously too late, it is the most economical and most appropriate way to take the public carriage directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now with the special approval of the captain, Klein does not need to be so tired, can sleep and get up, leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is waiting to take off his hat and say goodbye, suddenly think of something, look around, and press down the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Roshan, do you know what the beginning of the complete sequence that the church has mastered?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what he just forgot to ask Old Neil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosanna's eyes wide open, looking at Klein in amazement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to be Extraordinary?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so obvious? Klein touched his mouth and replied abruptly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After knowing that there is indeed extraordinary, mysterious power in the world, it will inevitably be a little yearning." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My goddess, do you know how dangerous it is? The captain did not tell you? The enemy of the extraordinary is not only a cult, a black wizard, but also Almost! Every year, someone loses control and someone sacrifices! Don’t you think about your family’s feelings?” Roshan used gestures to strengthen his tone and reacted a little too much. “Klein, I think it’s better to be a clerical person. There is almost no danger. The annual salary has also increased. When you have a few years, you can rent a single-family house in the North District or on the outskirts of the city, and you will be happy with a charming lady. Family, with cute, naughty little angels..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roshan, stop! Stop!" Klein saw the brown-haired girl say farther and farther, I quickly saw my forehead seeing the sweat and stopped. "I just want to think, think, Yes, understand the basic common sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." Luo Shan silently for a few seconds, looked down, not too embarrassed to say, "Because my father Things, I will always be on similar issues, um, you understand, a little excited, but, frankly, I admire every gentleman and woman who voluntarily become a night actor."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, I understand." Klein quickly agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosanna licked his eyes with light brown pupils and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My father I once said that don't think that it will become more powerful and become a higher sequence of extraordinary people, you can solve hidden dangers and fight dangers. In fact, on the contrary, you will encounter more and more terrible things when you encounter some unknown When horror exists, madness and death are the only two endings. Oh, he sacrificed the second week of this sentence... Klein, don’t look at me with sympathetic eyes, I live very much now. Ok, it’s really good! You should feel scared for these things!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I just want to understand basic common sense...” Klein didn’t know whether to cry or The smile repeated the answer just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Captain speaks more clearly and understands than you, and I have encountered something that is not possible even if I have not become an extraordinary person...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Roshan thought about it. "I heard both the captain and the old Neil, because of the reduction and extinction of super-species, the high-sequence strong Nowadays, this era is almost gone. It is very powerful to be an extraordinary person! We have hundreds of thousands of people in the suburbs of Tingen City. Probably, maybe more, more than 30 extraordinary people, hey, I Guess... Hey, I don't count the cult black wizards who live in the dark corner..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And in these more than 30 extraordinary people, the sequence 9 is the majority! Oh, I seem to be biased..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, these are also what I want to know. Common sense." Klein hopes that Rosanne can be like her, and it will reveal more situations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, being an extraordinary person, already very powerful, very powerful!" Rosanne repeated again, "the beginning of the complete sequence belonging to our church." It’s a 'sleepless person', the sequence 9' sleepless person!!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough... Klein can’t see the dagger, and Miss Rosanne can’t control her mouth. Describe below:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should guess when you listen to the name. 'The sleepless person' is a person who does not need to sleep at night, and only takes three to four hours during the day. Rest is enough, call, really envious... No, I am not envious, sleep is the gift of the goddess, the happiest thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Where is it? Ah, 'sleepers' can see through the dark without light, the deeper the night, the stronger, I mean all aspects of strength, including their power, their inspiration, their thinking, however, Although they can discover the unknown danger hidden in the dark, they can still use hunting when they encounter monsters that cannot be solved by normal methods. My son used to be a 'sleeper'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for Klein to ask, Roshan is self-satisfied:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the sequence of 'Midnight Poets', and then up is the sequence of 7 'nightmare'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nightmare? Klein remembered what Dunn Smith had to guide his dreams, and asked: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know?" Miss Rosanne's mouth was almost O-shaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The captain has been in my dreams..." Klein looked at each other and lowered the voice again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understanding..." Rosanne suddenly realized and responded with a whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked up the coffee cup next to me and took a sip, and turned to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The sequence of the church in our city of Tingen is only two. It should be that the captain is one of them. Even if he goes to the big parish of Beckland, he is a very powerful person. Some deacons are not necessarily better than him!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The captain was so great." Klein smiled and reconciled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Dunn Smith’s appearance in the middle of the night was very impressive, and he almost instinctively believed that he was a very extraordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course!" Rosanne proudly straightened his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, her expression jumped and said with distress: "I don't know what it is above the sequence 7, maybe the entire night team is only captain." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which other sequences start? Incomplete ones." Klein satisfactorily shifted the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that the "insomblower" described by Luo Shan does meet some of his imaginations and expectations for the extraordinary, but not the kind he wants to be, he The perfect "sequence 9" in my heart should be able to learn and master a lot of mysterious knowledge, to find out the reasons for its own crossing and to go back and lay the foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roshan thought for a moment, sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not too interested in this aspect I only know more than other churches. After all, the goddess is also the secret mother... Well, there should be two or three, because some players are always cold, scary, and the taste of the body is strange, some players Hey, I mean old Neil, he knows a lot, there are a lot of interesting magic rituals, I think, I think again, he once said his serial 9 title, which is the name of the potion recipe... ... ah, sneak peek!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of interesting magic rituals? Peeking at the secret? It sounds very close to what I want... Klein’s heart is slightly happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
