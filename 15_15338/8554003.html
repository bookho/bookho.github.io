			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein poses leisurely sitting in the position of "fool" and looks around in a circle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is Miss 'Magician', our new member."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he looked at Forth, one by one:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Miss 'Justice', this is the 'inverted man'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Folls responded to the code and nodded his head, while observing the members:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss justice" is a blonde lady, seems very young The sitting posture is quite elegant; the "downside down" Mr. hair is dark blue, the seaweed is messy, and the figure is not very strong. Although he does not like to talk, when he is watching, there will be a feeling of uneasiness. He should be a certain force. The leader... "Sun" seems to be just a teenager, very silent, very restrained. Besides, no other things can be seen. Maybe he is as weak as me; Mr. "World" looks very cold. Quite gloomy, a look at Miss writers write best-selling novel would not mess ...... enjoy plays to their strengths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she looked at several other members, several other members were also watching. Among them, "Justice" Audrey was the most careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the figure, you can exclude Miss Hugh, brown hair, slightly curled, this is Ms. Fols? For the time being, I can't rule out Mr. Fool's another pull. Others' possibilities, um, the pronunciation is consistent with the mouth shape, the details of Beckland's cavity, gas field and emotional color are also very consistent... Can Mr. Fool's not be able to forge the image for the members? He doesn't have to hide anything... In just a few seconds of observation, Audrey almost overlapped the vague figure with the image of Fols in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finding another fulcrum from other aspects, it is basically certain... She is very interested in verifying her extraordinary ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, she felt that she did not need to expose her identity to Fols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s better to leave a little secret, um... see when she can find it! "Justice" Audrey regained her gaze, squinting and quietly watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, because there is no new Russell diary, Klein manipulates the "world" to open: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to know the two sequences of 'Devil' and 'Guardian'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is sure that "Sun" classmates know the sequence 6 "Devil The details of the situation, because the other party mentioned "demonics" last time, and in order not to expose themselves in the investigation of serial killings, he deliberately added the sequence of "God of War" route 5 "guardian" - this route is also called As the "giant" approach, it is the mainstream road of the extraordinary people of Silver City. The "sun" cannot be unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequence 9 "warrior", sequence 8 "fighter" and sequence 7 "weapon master", Klein has long been mastered from the internal data of the night The detailed features, and the information of the sequence 6 "Dawn Knight", he just knew from the Utravsky priest, so, can ask, can afford the price, will not be wasted, only the sequence 5 "Guardian". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, he did not directly ask "the sun", but issued this commission to everyone, because according to "setting", joining Tarot will not take long The "world" cannot know that Silver City has the "giant" approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just a ‘devil’ sequence, I understand some things.” Alger, who has a certain position in the storm church, interjected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik Berger glanced at him, no longer thinking, straightening his back:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very clear about these two sequences."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reward I want is, the information about the 'fallen creator'." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether the two pieces of information are equivalent, determined by Mr. 'fool'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, he remembered that he had not consulted Mr. Fool’s consent and turned his head to look up and asked with respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the understanding of the "real creator", the ladies and gentlemen present are not as good as me... he is confidently adding a sentence to his heart. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they exchanged this matter, the "magician" Firth heard a glimpse of it:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""The 'devil' sequence is the 'demon' route? What is the sequence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which way is the 'guardian'? ?Sequences?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never heard of..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God Ah, they have to exchange the information of the 'real creator'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The one is the oldest and most powerful being in the gods."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the organization I joined?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "world" that got the "fool" affirmative answer Without hesitation, he said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I apply for a separate exchange."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to hear it...can save recently, from the New Year More than a month, hold back, Audrey! "Justice" Audrey squinted and reluctantly regained sight from the "sun." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They immediately blocked the visual, auditory, and spiritual intuitions of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "World" quickly immersed itself in "writing" on the paper of its own, understanding of the "real creator", including "the hanging giant" and " The orthodox image of the eyes behind the shadows, including the members of the Aurora Club, believes that this evil spirit is the master who created everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, Klein added a visual impression of his contact with the evil spirits, sensing the spirit of the gods, and listening to the voice of the "real creator":<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Degraded, distorted, bloody, crazy, evil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as the "fool" Mr. The judgement is given: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The value of this intelligence is slightly higher than the two sequences of 'Devil' and 'Guardian', but the difference is not big." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Mr. 'fool'." "Sun" Dairik took the piece of parchment sincerely, from beginning to end, carefully watching Several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one thing that he is most concerned about is that the "real creator" is the master who created everything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distorted, Fallen, Crazy...Dairick silently recited these words, and the looming sight seemed to have been seen in the silver city for more than two thousand years. Black tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Lord not abandon us? However, he is insane... "The Sun" Dairik found that he could use the embarrassing thoughts to examine the "creator of all things, the omnipotent God" worshipped by the Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should answer my question." "World" hoarsely urged one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric converges on boiling and sad thoughts, silent for two seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After the different demonic creatures take the 'devil' potion, the variations are not the same. Each has its own characteristics. Which kind of demon do you want to know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; There is still such a difference? Klein was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately discovered one thing, that is, his previous thoughts existed in the blind spot of thinking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, if the murderer of the serial killings is not a human being, but an animal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
