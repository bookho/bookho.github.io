			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going out, Klein took the time to clean up the dress and hat with a small brush and a handkerchief, then changed the white shirt and put it on the linen With the original decent cheap jacket, I quickly came to the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Melissa’s skirt, then Benson’s formal dress, and finally I can consider my second set. Money is not enough. The pieces are used to entertain the guests' glazed porcelain tableware... and they have to save money for the purchase of various occult materials... Klein sat on the public carriage, thinking about the financial situation at home, and the more he shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He estimates that it will take at least a year for him to let his brother and sister live like the so-called middle class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is not a case of promotion and salary increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public carriage drove across a street and parked opposite the "Divination Club" on Howth Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein held down the black non-silk half-high hat, half-jumped and walked underground, along the familiar road, into the club door on the second floor, saw Beautiful lady Angelique with brown hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eye has a residual redness, but the whole person is very relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein raised his hand and tapped his eyebrows twice, scrutinizing it and discovering that the deep color of An Jielika’s emotions was dissipated. Many, and added a few sunny white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading, Klein went over and took off his hat and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An Jie Ms. Lika, it’s a sunny day, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika raised her head and exclaimed in a short burst of time, and immediately smiled. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very similar to Mr. Fansent’s cat. There is no sound when you walk. Well, can you see it? Oh, I forgot, you It’s a diviner who is good at seeing faces...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused and licked her lips for a ceremony:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, thank you for your advice yesterday, I feel much better. I have never been relaxed, happy, and satisfied like this."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the sincere thanks of the other party, Klein was also infected with the joy and happiness, and the corners of his mouth were swayed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can help You are my honor."<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he only felt that his spirituality was easy and lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "divination" that the "potions" want? Can you really help the inquirer's "divination"? Klein seemed to pinch his eyebrows as he thought, and quietly clicked twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that he has found in practice that the current action to open and close "Lingshi" is not concealed, but the problem is that he can’t think of it for a short time. A better alternative, because he did not become a "divination" for a long time, the spirituality has not yet grown to the current limit, and the same is true of its own, so it must be a medium that can effectively stimulate spiritual position to act as a "switch". And there are not many such parts, and the eyebrows are a relatively superior choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thoroughly digesting the "potions" and becoming a true "divination", you should be able to design a more subtle "switch" action... Klein Micro Invisible nodding, go to the conference room halfway open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coffee, or black tea?" An Jieli quickly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dixi Coffee." Klein replied with a taste of all kinds of drinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw six or seven members in the conference room, but did not include Hainas Vansente, who had been here before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Vincent did not come?" Klein stopped and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Vincent does not come every day. He accepts the invitation and goes to a divination organization in the port of Enmat. You have something to look for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, just curious, after all, I can see him every time I come." Klein shook his head with a smile. At the same time, he found that the seven members had familiar faces:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glazis who has divined himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glassis was wearing a monocle to look at the information on the table, and suddenly noticed that someone was watching himself, so he raised his head and looked at the origin of the line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a clear joy in his face, standing with his hands, standing up, and rushing to Klein a few steps:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Mr. Moretti, I have been thinking about it, will you come today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listening to An Jie Lika said, you are not a doctor, but a diviner who is good at looking at the face?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not only good at this, Mr. Glacis, you seem to have completely got rid of the disease?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pinched his forehead With a slight eyebrow, I found that the healthy colors of Glacis returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I really regretted it, regretting that I didn't listen to your suggestion, but fortunately, there is a very powerful pharmacist near my house, he I gave my wife a pretty magical potion, which kept me away from death." Glacis said with emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an associate member of the Night Squad, Klein asked professionally sensitively:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "A very powerful pharmacist? A pretty magical pharmacy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fantastic? How amazing? Is it an extraordinary category? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said that it is a folk agent on the side of Lenburg. In short, it is very helpful for my illness." Glacis did not feel abnormally answered. Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folk Herbalist? Klein seemed to knock on his eyebrows like thinking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is his name? Where do you live? You know, the diviner can't guarantee that he won't get sick. Maybe I will go to him to buy pharmacy in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein knows through the mentor and classmates that the modern medical system of this world has just formed, many There is almost no way to cure the disease. Therefore, the magical pharmacy and the powerful pharmacist still have a lot of market. It is not wrong to know if there is a need. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glassian replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His name is Rosen Duckway, There is a small shop at No. 18 Vlad Street in the Eastern District, called 'Rossen's Folk Herbal Shop'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Klein silently wrote down. Sincerely open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glassis turned his body and led him to sit next to him. At this time, Angelica also made a good coffee and brought it over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dixi coffee is more fragrant than Nanwei coffee, but the taste is relatively poor... Kline sipped and tasted for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grasses saw him put down the white glazed cup and was busy thinking about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Moretti, can I ask you to help me with my divination? I will pay according to the price you have determined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"8 pence is enough, I There will be no temporary price hikes.” Klein is hoping someone will find himself divination. “Need to go to the divination room?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Okay, citrine room.” Glacis was more familiar than he was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Gracies, what do you want to divination?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an investment opportunity, but the amount involved is too much, if it fails, me and me The family will be hit hard, I want to divination whether it can be smooth." Glacis took the initiative to mention, "I used the Tarot card to divination once, um, is the divination after the pure heart, the results are not bad, is It’s my own interpretation, but I didn’t violate those symbolic principles.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it, curiously said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you will describe the matter in detail, and then give your own information. If you can have the other party, it will be better. We will do astronomical divination."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Glacis sorted out the language. "When Mr. Lalhous visited the Hornachs, he found a rich and good-looking Large iron ore, he spent a lot of money to buy the land, and asked a professional company to do a survey, and it was encouraging. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He lacked follow-up development funds, so he set up a steel company, intending to use this project to apply for loans from banks, and simultaneously issue a certain percentage of stocks. To raise the initial funds, this plan is still in the private preparation stage, and the rewards are very rich."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last reading newspapers, "historical experts" Klein knows that the world has stocks, and that the concept of stocks is derived from Russell the Great, and, um, it is him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of colonizing the South Continent, he established the West Byron Company, and raised funds through the issuance of stocks to solve the financial problems successfully. The first bucket of gold for colonial interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the rewards are generous, since then, similar things have happened one after another, such as railway stocks, mine stocks, steam development and utilization of stocks, etc. Wait a minute, there are successes and failures, so the organization such as the Beckland Stock Exchange was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Russell also made national bonds, trust funds and other things. The former has been the most stable investment method, and it is the most stable investment every year. There are four to six percent returns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein remembers that his brother Benson once said that if he can inherit the property of 3,000 pounds, then there is no need to work hard, because there are hundreds of stable annuity income. About five points, about 150 pounds, slightly equal to Kline's current annual salary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the so-called food class... Klein sighs and asks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Are you sure there is no problem with this matter? Lalhous is trustworthy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen his real estate documents and exploration reports, which have The seal of the West Vilas County Government and the endorsement of the professional company, and Mr. Laurus’s office also has him and Sir Deville, and the mayor’s photo.” Glacis nodded and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photos? A group photo can't represent anything... Klein, who was born in the era of knowledge explosion, saw too many similar things and was not convinced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he believes that it is useless to believe that he can only pick up the pen and draw the corresponding chart based on the key time information provided by Glacis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Klein pointed to the "Astrolabe" road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should also It can be seen that this thing will be very unsatisfactory. Under the prosperity of the surface is the cliff, the abyss. My divination opinion is to bypass it and avoid it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Glacis fell into silence, his mouth opened several times, and he re-closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, he smiled bitterly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After going home, I will be serious Considered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing such an answer, Klein could only shake his head and sigh, and realized the helplessness of a "divination":<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Divination" can only give advice and cannot be decided for others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
