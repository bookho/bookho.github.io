			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going out, Klein took the time to clean up the dress and hat with a small brush and a handkerchief, then changed the white shirt and put it on the linen With the original decent cheap jacket, I quickly came to the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Melissa’s skirt, then Benson’s formal dress, and finally I can consider my second set. Money is not enough. The pieces are used to entertain the guests' glazed porcelain tableware... and they have to save money for the purchase of various occult materials... Klein sat on the public carriage, thinking about the financial situation at home, and the more he shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He estimates that it will take at least a year for him to let his brother and sister live like the so-called middle class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is not a case of promotion and salary increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public carriage drove across a street and parked opposite the "Divination Club" on Howth Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein held down the black non-silk half-high hat, half-jumped and walked underground, along the familiar road, into the club door on the second floor, saw Beautiful lady Angelique with brown hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eye has a residual redness, but the whole person is very relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein raised his hand and tapped his eyebrows twice, scrutinizing it and discovering that the deep color of An Jielika’s emotions was dissipated. Many, and added a few sunny white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading, Klein went over and took off his hat and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An Jie Ms. Lika, it’s a sunny day, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika raised her head and exclaimed in a short burst of time, and immediately smiled. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very similar to Mr. Fansent’s cat. There is no sound when you walk. Well, can you see it? Oh, I forgot, you It’s a diviner who is good at seeing faces...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused and licked her lips for a ceremony:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, thank you for your advice yesterday, I feel much better. I have never been relaxed, happy, and satisfied like this."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the sincere thanks of the other party, Klein was also infected with the joy and happiness, and the corners of his mouth were swayed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can help You are my honor."<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he only felt that his spirituality was easy and lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "divination" that the "potions" want? Can you really help the inquirer's "divination"? Klein seemed to pinch his eyebrows as he thought, and quietly clicked twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that he has found in practice that the current action to open and close "Lingshi" is not concealed, but the problem is that he can’t think of it for a short time. A better alternative, because he did not become a "divination" for a long time, the spirituality has not yet grown to the current limit, and the same is true of its own, so it must be a medium that can effectively stimulate spiritual position to act as a "switch". And there are not many such parts, and the eyebrows are a relatively superior choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thoroughly digesting the "potions" and becoming a true "divination", you should be able to design a more subtle "switch" action... Klein Micro Invisible nodding, go to the conference room halfway open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coffee, or black tea?" An Jieli quickly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dixi Coffee." Klein replied with a taste of all kinds of drinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw six or seven members in the conference room, but did not include Hainas Vansente, who had been here before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Vincent did not come?" Klein stopped and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika wrote a slogan:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Vincent does not have a daily All come, he accepts the invitation to go to a divination organization in the port of Enmat, and you have something to look for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, just curious, after all, I can see him every time I come." Klein shook his head with a smile. At the same time, he found that the seven members had familiar faces:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glazis who has divined himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glassis was wearing a monocle to look at the information on the table, and suddenly noticed that someone was watching himself, so he raised his head and looked at the origin of the line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a clear joy in his face, standing with his hands, standing up, and rushing to Klein a few steps:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Mr. Moretti, I have been thinking about it, will you come today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listening to An Jie Lika said, you are not a doctor, but a diviner who is good at looking at the face?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not only good at this, Mr. Glacis, you seem to have completely got rid of the disease?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pinched his forehead With a slight eyebrow, I found that the healthy colors of Glacis returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I really regretted it, regretting that I didn't listen to your suggestion, but fortunately, there is a very powerful pharmacist near my house, he I gave my wife a pretty magical potion, which kept me away from death." Glacis said with emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an associate member of the Night Squad, Klein asked professionally sensitively:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "A very powerful pharmacist? A pretty magical pharmacy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fantastic? How amazing? Is it an extraordinary category? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said that it is a folk agent on the side of Lenburg. In short, it is very helpful for my illness." Glacis did not feel abnormally answered. Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folk Herbalist? Klein seemed to knock on his eyebrows like thinking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is his name? Where do you live? You know, the diviner can't guarantee that he won't get sick. Maybe I will go to him to buy pharmacy in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein knows through the mentor and classmates that the modern medical system of this world has just formed, many There is almost no way to cure the disease. Therefore, the magical pharmacy and the powerful pharmacist still have a lot of market. It is not wrong to know if there is a need. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glassian replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His name is Rosen Duckway, There is a small shop at No. 18 Vlad Street in the Eastern District, called 'Rossen's Folk Herbal Shop'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Klein silently wrote down. Sincerely open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glassis turned his body and led him to sit next to him. At this time, Angelica also made a good coffee and brought it over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dixi coffee is more fragrant than Nanwei coffee, but the taste is relatively poor... Kline sipped and tasted for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grasses saw him put down the white glazed cup and was busy thinking about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Moretti, can I ask you to help me with my divination? I will pay according to the price you have determined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"8 pence is enough, I There will be no temporary price hikes.” Klein is hoping someone will find himself divination. “Need to go to the divination room?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Okay, citrine room.” Glacis was more familiar than he was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the divination room, locked the wooden door, Klein sat down after the long table, and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Gracies, what do you want to divination?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an investment opportunity, but the amount involved is too much, if it fails I and my family will be hit hard, I want to divination whether it can be smooth." Glacis took the initiative to mention, "I used the Tarot card to divination once, um, is the divination after the pure heart, the result Not bad, yes, it is my own interpretation, but I did not violate those symbolic principles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
