			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the glass window, the garden is full of branches and gloom, the river is dark and flowing, reflecting a little starlight, and the nearby houses are revealing warm and warm glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is quiet to the extreme, as if welcoming the coming of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five senses are not exquisite, but the combination of the beautiful Terry takes back the line of sight, walks quickly to the coat rack, removes one A hooded black robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly put on this item, fastened the button, fastened the belt, turned over the hood, and turned herself into an assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry raised her right hand and wiped it in front of her face, suddenly making the face covered by the hood obscure and blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, she reached out and took a glittering powder from her pocket in her waist and sprinkled it on her body with a spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry's figure began to disappear in an inch, the outline lines were like pencils, and were completely erased by the eraser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete the invisibility, she left the bedroom silently, came to the opposite room, and pushed open the window without the guardrail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a light leap, Terry stood on the window sill, looking down at the lawn behind the small building, overlooking the iron fence almost integrated into the night, overlooking the positive The "collector" Frye quietly turned over the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a breath, fell like a feather, and stepped on the lawn without any sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wearing a black trench coat, carrying a special revolver, Frye with high nose and thin lips carefully looked around and looked for possible evil spirits or evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see these things directly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry is quietly approaching Frye and wandering around his back, not knowing when he has a dagger with a "black paint". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shot like a swift wind, and then dipped the dagger into Frye’s midfielder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the horror that she saw before her eyes was broken and the illusion was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry found herself standing on the window sill, still looking down at the lawn and looking down at the iron fence fence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the fence, there is no longer just a "corpse" Frye, but Leonard Mitchell, who is aiming at the window sill, and closed Dunn Smith, who is holding his eyes and holding his eyebrows and half-bow body, the invisible ripples around the night captain seem to be circling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry tweeted and understood that it was just a dream, I didn’t know when I slept! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! Pong! Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard and Frye fired three shots and accurately hit an invisible goal that seemed to have not been awake from the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silhouette of Terry's figure emerged, first cracked, and immediately became a fragment, turning into a rough silver mirror fragment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the house, she used a avatar spell to turn around and walk along the corridor and the stairs until she reached the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! In this layer, the coldness is so cold that the frozen wind will never stop, and the invisible, transparent figure lingers in every place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry who lost her stealth effect will have a lower body temperature every time she passes through this ghost-like existence, when she finally arrives at the altar, I couldn’t help but shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The altar is a round table with a statue of a white bone carved in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statue has the size of a normal adult man's head, and the eyebrows have only a vague outline, which seems to be a beautiful woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hair stretched from her head to her ankles, and her roots were clear and thick, like a snake and a tentacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of each hair has one more eye, or it is closed or shackled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of puppets piled up in a mess around this sinister idol, with rough working puppets with names and corresponding information, for example, Joyce Mayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three candles on the round table, swaying in the cold and whistling winds of the faint yellow green flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry greeted the gods with a sigh of relief in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, she pushed the puppet, pressed the candle, and picked up the idol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind screamed and the window that was tightly closed violently shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! Click! One side of the glass is broken, and the wind that is cold and lifeless has blown in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just wandered to the other side, did not dare to smash into the altar range of Freyton when he shuddered, only the blood was getting cold, in the frost I only feel that my movements are obviously slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, his ankles were tight, as if he had been firmly grasped by something invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More cold feelings spread from the contact position, for other sequences 9 extraordinary, must be paralyzed and stiff, but Fry as a "collector" "It is no stranger to a similar state." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned the left-wheel muzzle and pulled the trigger against the side of the ankle. It seemed to be able to see who the enemy was and see where he was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver hunter bullet hit the wind in exchange for a sorrowful sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible shadows dissipated, and Frye regained the ability to act freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Dunn Smith, who wants to climb to the second floor and avoid the front of the altar, was also frozen by the cold wind of the expansion. Broken outside the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! The dark curtain behind the window suddenly rose and shrouded Dunn, just as the monster opened his mouth and swallowed the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn’s head was immediately wrapped in a life-like curtain, and the tighter the wrap, the more the nose and mouth were outlined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the state of suffocation, Dunn stepped on his feet, his knees straight, and his back turned, and he broke the curtain by brute force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed the corner of the curtain wrapped in his head with his left hand, pulled it down and threw it to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand as a shot, and shot at the back of the window and wanted to cover the half curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtain immediately stopped, and a deep red rose quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the lawn, Leonard Mitchell, who is singing poetry, is also smashed by the cold wind that has a strong sense of death. It sounds loud and it is difficult to make a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the ruined vines suddenly spread, entangled in his ankles, and a black shadow also smashed through the raging wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lennard, who had a slightly stiff body, had no time to shoot, so he had to rush his shoulders and lift his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! The black shadow reached his arm position and let his sharp spikes get into the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a delicate, bright red flower, I don’t know where to come from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard took a sigh of relief and took this flower, which had been stained with his own blood, aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
