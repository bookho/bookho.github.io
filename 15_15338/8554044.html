			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The belief in the night country of the main peak of the Hornachs Mountains "The rule of the night, the mother of the sky"... This and the "night wolf" Fregra exist relationship? So, the illusory proverb I heard was "Honakis... Fregra"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Night Wolf" Fregra, what is the relationship between the ancient god and the goddess? According to Russell, the sequence 0 is equal to the true god, and each sequence has only one sequence 0... The goddess inherits the authority of the "night wolf"? Not the oldest god, not the self-proclaimed creator of one eye? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, there is a side clue that is not proven, the life school people worship the moon, worship the creator of one eye, and the red moon, but But don't believe in the goddess of the night...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thinks about a lot of things, manipulates the "world" and considers the opening:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, the thing of the king of the devil, Fregra, is also a myth and legend in Silver City. "The Sun" Dairik thinks that he is almost unanswered, and is quite embarrassed to propose, "Mr. World, you can change a question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Change a question? Little "sun", you are too straight... then I am welcome! Klein made the "world" hoarse and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your honesty and trustworthiness are impressive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I have met an extraordinary person before, he is free to switch between the body and the spirit, and can make a living corpse, do you know which route belongs to which route?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the "sun" is in the land of God, in the city of silver, it is impossible to contact Beckland, the capital of the Kingdom of Lun, but Klein is cautious and will refer to it. Miss Sharon’s “her” was changed to “he”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, he is not a high-ranking strong." "World" is a low-filled sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik seriously recalled the contents of the textbook:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If not If the high sequence is strong, then the 'immortal bird' route can be ruled out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The way of the dead bird?" Klein deliberately made the "world" show a certain Surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After participating in so many gatherings, "Sun" Dairik is very clear, in the sequence of ways, the customary name of Silver City and Miss "Justice", etc. There is a certain discrepancy between the descriptions of people, so it is not surprising to explain: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is the extraordinary way to dominate death and to control the spiritual world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's sequence 9 is 'the corpse'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original is the "Death" route... In this way, the ancestor of the immortal bird, Gary Carrie, is an ancient god of death... Kline’s posture is constantly sitting at the top of the bronze long table, manipulating the “world” nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, you continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik immediately replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The only thing I can think of is two possibilities. One is the special 'devil'. As I said before, the demons that are derived from different races are different, and there are flesh and spirit. The type of free energy conversion, but this is quite rare, and may not be able to make a living corpse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Humans can?" "World" asks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, at least I don't know there are similar examples." "The Sun" Dairik said honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the second possibility?" Klein recalled the performance of Miss Sharon in peacetime and in combat, and the "world" changed her sitting posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derrick replied solemnly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Different species? Doesn't this mean a monster?" "World" hoarsely asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein clearly remembers that Mr. Azick once mentioned that “heterogeneous” refers to the collective name of the cursed human being, because of the difference in curses, the formation of aliens Different races. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are usually the same as humans, but there is always a twisted and repressed desire in their hearts. When a particular scene appears or is stimulated by a specific thing, it will erupt. It will become a monster, satisfying the desire to kill and bloodthirsty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time they erupt, they become a bit cold and eventually lose their positive feelings as human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most representative of these is the "wolf man." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik nodded calmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, heterogeneity is because of The negative effects of these extraordinary features, and the various monsters that are differentiated from humans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a curse, but a negative caused by some extraordinary characteristics influences? The "fool" Klein, who sat in the thick fog, found that this was different from Mr. Azick's description. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the understanding of heterogeneity before the Cataclysm? The common sense that everyone in Baiyincheng knows is quite valuable to the extraordinary people of the North and the South.... Klein has become more aware of the speciality of the land of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Dairik continued: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The characteristics of 'heterogeneous' are just right An extraordinary way has been formed, so normal humans can become alienated by taking potions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Different pathways? Which one does this mean? What is the corresponding sequence 9?” Klein asked curiously to the “world”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik did not care that this was the other question of the other party, and regarded it as a necessary supplement:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Silver City, the corresponding sequence 9 is called 'Prisoner'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The heart is a prisoner, the world Prisoners, this generation refers to the madness and suppressed desires that are bound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prisoners"? This route is in the hands of the "Rose School". They are known for their bloody sacrifices and worship the so-called "Bounded God"... Miss Sharon does not look like such a cold and indiscriminate person... and so on, Maric seems to be being pursued by a certain force. Is he and Miss Sharon a defector of the "Rose School"? Defeating in order not to become a crazy cultist? Klein made the guess that the "world" said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am satisfied with your answer, the transaction is completed."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, several members shared their insights and news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein ended this Tarot party in time before the spiritual consumption was exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fog, return to calm, not even a dummy, he began to travel to and from this mysterious space and the real world, bringing the "master key" In the ancient palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I infer from the Russell’s diary that the “apprentice” route has a high probability of not having a sequence of 0, it cannot be smashed, and sequence 1 and sequence 2 may be Can effectively counterattack in the air... And, in case there is a sequence 0? Can't take life to gamble... Klein eased for a while, writing the divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The source of it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he took the "master key", lest the "it" name point to the wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaning against the back of the chair, Klein silently recited the divination statement and gradually entered the sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the illusory world, he saw a bronze lamp stand swaying with many candlelights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light frame seems to be a secret room. There is no outside light, and there are long tables, black iron pots, glass jars, brown notes and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ancestors, I have to embark on the path of extraordinary, I will be able to reproduce the glory of the Abraham family!" He muttered, drinking the bottle of medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muscles of his face were twisted and twisted, showing a painful expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, he screamed, fell to the ground, constantly struggling, constantly licking his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, he shredded his clothes, faded his skin and turned into a bloody monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood and blood exploded, each piece seems to have vitality, constantly climbing around, leaving traces of corrosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, they failed to leave the Chamber of Secrets and slowly returned to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly gathered together, combined with a broken finger, turned into a simple brass color key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Klein saw a silver pocket watch with diamonds in the pieces of clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream ended, he blinked and looked forward, sighing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Really, to restore the glory of the Abraham family, the first step is to fail... There is also a certain risk in becoming a sequence of 9..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Abraham The family is a great aristocrat of the Quaternary Tudor dynasty. It is said to have the extraordinary path of "apprentice", but it may not be complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein recalls the picture he just saw, his fingers tapping the edge of the long table and talking to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s Ruan, you can't hear the accent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Popularly set a pure diamond on a pocket watch It’s the last ten years without attaching other gems.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ahead to go to the harvest church and ask where Utravsky is from The master key you get... maybe you can find some clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Klein was ready to leave the fog, the illusory stars that symbolize "magicians" have The expansion and contraction, this is the request for a sacrifice ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falth would not have brought so much cash on her body, but she was preparing to attend the extraordinary party before, so I specially reserved 500 pounds to see if When I bought the item I wanted, who knows, the corresponding party was cancelled because of the situation. Now it is used to pay for the "pharmacist" formula and "playing the law" for a total of 430 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the light curtain appearing and seeing the banknotes that were put in disappeared, Folss took a few seconds to react, and sincerely thanked Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "pharmacist" formula sold to Viscount Glylint is 300 pounds, not too greedy, which will undermine the long-term relationship... Miss Audrey There, for the time being, I don’t want to take care of it. She hopes to get in touch with the psychological alchemy club and get the corresponding formula directly. It really doesn’t work. I will go to the Tarot party to buy it... oh, I have to observe whether the “playing the law” has any effect, if any, Just consider how to ask the "fool" Mr., oh ... this idiot, usually "arbitrator", unwittingly meets the requirements of "playing the law"... Foer thinks of the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While receiving a reward of 430 pounds, Klein also received the prayer of Miss Justice. She said that if the "fool" is no longer needed In cash, she can use the promise of collecting Russell's diary to change the 200-pound banknote, and be sure to satisfy Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very satisfied, only a few dozen pounds, I have 1,000 pounds! Klein declined the kindness of Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he was busy helping the "Sun" classmates "wake up" the memory of the Seven Gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, Klein tiredly returned to the real world, opened the curtains, and looked back at the file of the serial killings, looking for the possible existence. animal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
