			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a task that I want to delegate...you are afraid to find the wrong place...The brand of this security company is really just a brand...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the words of the person coming, Klein suddenly smashed a full mouth, only hate that there is no forum and barrage to communicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he quickly thought that he had asked similar things. The captain’s answer was, if there is free time, why not pick it up? The money earned can be used as a small vault for the team and the welfare of the participants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosanna’s eyes turn and think for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Our security staff are out of the task The fastest one will take at least an hour to come back. If your business is not urgent, you can consider it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six-member official member of the night, captain Dunn Smith was invited by the bishop to go to the church. I don't know what to discuss. Leonard Mitchell is guarding him for the Chanis Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The corpse" Frye and the "sleepless" Luo Yao. Lai Ting has traveled to the Jintongtong District to cooperate with the police to investigate a theft of a sectarian element. Another "sleepless" Cohenriw White took a break, and another "midnight poet", Siga Thorn, went to the "Rafael Cemetery" on the outskirts of the North District for daily inspections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two remaining extraordinary people, the old Neil grew up, the body was weak, and had not been out of the task for a long time, and Klein was still a beginner. Every aspect is a half-bone in the true sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not in..." The white-skinned man with a portable umbrella is dark, removes the hat, and walks into the court. "Excuse me, leave." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his body and walked out the door. In the sound of the rain and the whistling wind, he left the Zoutelan Street 36 along the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not a coincidence." Roshan watched the gentleman leave and sighed with regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the commission won won't have her share, there is definitely no share of a big meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No way, Chanis must be guarded at all times." Klein satisfactorily put down the knife and fork and the spoon, even if he didn't like the turnips and vegetables. The mixed soup is also clean. "Don't you want Brett to go out for a mission? Or, yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosanna's eyes turn , laughing and talking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bright can't, but you can, our 'Diviner'..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the words are not finished, she suddenly wakes up and quickly shuts up, because the door has not been closed at this time. If someone passing by or visiting people hears the extraordinary things, it is leaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, the captain is not..." Roshan looked at the door and secretly spit out his tongue. "Or else you have to regret it!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright and Klein laughed at the same time, and began to clean up the tableware after a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do all this, see the rain does not stop, Klein without an umbrella choose to stay in the "Black Thorns Security Company." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a newspaper, sat down on a soft, flexible sofa, and leisurely started a "noon break." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The airship route from Beckland to Desi Bay was opened..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ""Detective Munson" is organized into a book, about to be published..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Advertising at the Lauglas Weapons Store? 1 standard revolver with 6 rounds Bullets, 3 pounds 10 sule, 2 double shotguns..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Klein looked at the "Tingen City Honest Man" and suddenly found a news:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... killing Mr. Welch and Ms. Naya The criminals have all been arrested. It is believed that the panic atmosphere spreading in the North District, the Golden Indus District and the Eastern District will be greatly alleviated... Welch’s father, the banker Mr. McGwan, escorted the body of his younger son and returned. In Conston, a grand funeral is about to take place..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading it over and over again, Klein suddenly sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Welch’s father had already believed in the police’s rhetoric and did not ask another private detective to investigate. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lost the mood of his younger son, certainly not my dad and my mother lost their only child...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Emotions are low, Klein is sitting there, there is no movement for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the funeral of Welch and Naya, they did not invite themselves. He was not surprised at all, nor was he depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything subsides, look for an opportunity to go to the graves of both of them to offer a bunch of flowers... Klein is waiting for a nap in the lounge, the entrance to the reception hall Suddenly it was ringing again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please come in." The head of Rosanne was a little bit awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hidden door was pushed open, and the tall, thin man who was wearing a formal dress and a white horn was once again coming in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I wait here for a while? Your mercenary, no, security guards should come back soon?" He tried to hide his anxious expression, sincerely Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you should sit there for a while." Rosanne pointed to the sofa next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein asked curiously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where did you hear about us? Who is the security company? Who introduced you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is going back and forth at noon in the heavy rain, and willing to wait? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it must be that the members of the night team have solved the difficult tasks in the eyes of others very easily, and accumulated enough prestige in this line...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall, thin man leaned his umbrella against the door and walked toward the sofa, smiling with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I have visited all the mercenaries, squatters, security companies and private detectives in the nearby streets. Only you have hopes here. They have no human task at all. Frankly speaking, if it is not met A waiter who gave the meal, I really can't think of a security company here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... is totally different from what I thought... Klein stayed stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roshan is interjecting: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are busy? So many tasks?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall, thin-skinned man sat down and sighed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Mercenary squad, no, security company, should I have heard of the burglary and murder of the Hows block?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horse block... burglary Case... Well, unfortunately, I am one of the parties... Klein nodded slightly and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of the murder and cruelty of the criminals, the neighborhoods, and even the rich people of the whole city of Tingen, are afraid. They add a lot of security in addition to their own escorts. Personnel and private detectives have made obvious vacancies in this line." The tall and thin man replied clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard chain reaction... Klein and Rosanne looked at each other and saw the self-deprecating on the other's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security industry entered the "golden period", and the black thorns did not have any feelings. It shows how unsuccessful this company has been. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in a sense, it also proves the hidden success of the night team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for more than 20 minutes, seeing the rainstorm will stop, Klein is ready to pack and leave, go to the "shooting club" to practice the revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the black-haired green Leonard Mitchell came out of the partition and wondered about the sofa position:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Delegator, the captain is back?" Luo Shanxin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Return?" The tall, thin man listened at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was sitting here, staring at the door, why didn't I find someone coming back? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosanna’s expression suddenly froze, busy laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As a security company, We don't have only the front door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." The tall and thin man nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the title of the captain, he does not feel strange at all. The security company is the former mercenary squad or the small mercenary guild. The appearance of the "captain" is quite normal. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard’s white shirt was not tied, the black vest was casually draped, and he looked at the tall, thin man, and suddenly he screamed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the security guard of the Black Thorns, what do you call it? Is there anything you want to commission?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Perhaps I have heard that the "mercenaries" are not arrogant, and the high-skinned men are not insulted by anger, but they are relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Leonard and sat down to organize the language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Kelly It is the steward of Mr. Wickrol, the tobacco company. His only son, Elliott, was kidnapped this morning. We have already reported the police and received enough attention, but Mr. Wickrol is not at ease. Through your mercenaries, defamation, security personnel channels, and your knowledge of Tingen, investigate from another direction to ensure that Elliott is safely rescued."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can find a place where the kidnappers are hiding, Mr. Wickrol is willing to pay 100 pounds. If you have the means and successfully rescue the young Master Elliot, he is willing to double the reward, one time. Give 200 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Mitchell smiled leisurely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Kroll seems to only want us to find a place where the kidnappers hide. Otherwise, it would not think that his only son is worth only £100, and is close to the southern plantations. The tobacco merchants of the relationship will not only get 200 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Mr. Wickrol is just an ordinary businessman, not a rich man, and, The rescued thing, he believes that the police department is more professional." The old butler replied calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, no problem." Leonard snapped another finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His green eyes look to Rosanne:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful lady, trouble you To draw up a contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't always be a poet, in fact, you will only slap others' works." Roshan is used to Helen Nader ridiculed each other and forgot that there were guests present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Blackthorn Security Company will not care about what the commissioner is, there is good, no, it doesn't matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosanna left the reception desk and entered the clerical office, and the slamming sound of the slamming sounded immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein twitched at the corner of his mouth and felt that they were too unprofessional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no standard, ready-made contract! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really a sad thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And more sad Yes, I am in such a non-professional company..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a lot of thoughts, and Rona has prepared a short contract with only a few terms to let the housekeeper engrave Lee and Leonard Mitchell signed the words respectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the engraving of the chapter, she took the contract and entered the accounting room, looking for Mrs. Oliana to get the chapter of "Black Thorns Security Company" - This seal has little effect. Dunn usually handed it to Oliana for safekeeping. On Sunday, he gave Rosanne and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
