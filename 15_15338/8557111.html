			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the shock, another doubt floated on the heart of the "hanging man" Alger:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Since Mr. "The Fool" had long foreseen, why should he also openly point out that the things in Banxi are related to "Redemption Rose" and "King of Angels" Medici? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately told us? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that we can promote this through us? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal is directed at the "king of angels" Medici? No, the bigger possibility is the "real creator"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Footer" has repeatedly destroyed the "real creator" plot, this time should be no exception... The term "redemption rose" appears in "real creator" In the abandoned temple, founded by the "King of Angels" Medici and Uluos, apparently has a deep connection with the "real creator"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Banxi Port is only our storm church. What does Mr. Fool really tell me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger vaguely understood something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he was keenly aware of a problem:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"World" last mentioned Baker Rand will have a big event, which was immediately confirmed by Mr. Fool, and then involved the awakening of the "original witch" and the advent of the "real creator." This time, the Banxi port change he said also received the response of Mr. Fool. Unveil the hidden secrets of the ancient Binxi, let the "redemption rose" and "king of angels" Medici appear in front of the members of the Tarot Society... Is this too coincidental? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the news before the "world" was related to Beckland, this is the first time involving the sea, and Mr. "fool" mentioned last week, His leader had to leave Beckland because of the foggy and horrific case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the "world" is actually the leader of Mr. "fool"? No, it should be the representative of all the prostitutes in the Tarot Society. He will do some things that He is inconvenient to do for Mr. Fool. Of course, the deaf will also use this gathering to trade goods and knowledge and improve themselves. Purpose, this is considered to be the cultivation of Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think carefully, this guess is probably right, at least the "world" has never collected Russell's diary, from the "fool" In exchange for knowledge or intelligence... As a leader, this is his duty, and it has been submitted privately! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this conclusion, some deliberate problems and contradictions in the "world" are concealing the identity of their own, which is in line with his experienced experience. specialty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. "The Fool" organizes the Tarot gathering, in addition to concealing the secret recovery, attempting to unravel the seal step by step, and still using our purpose of interfering with certain events. This can be seen from the composition of the members, the upper aristocrats, the extraordinary members of the church bishops, the survivors of the abandoned land, the students of the Abraham family, the adult vampires, each representing a force or a circle, a channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many ideas flashed, "downside down" Alger not only was not suppressed by his own guess, but was a little excited, for him, "fool" The unknown purpose is the most horrible thing. If you understand what He wants to do, he can effectively avoid risks and use it to improve himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the "fool" wants to use us to do things, it will definitely give some benefits. This is exactly what I expected... otherwise I don't know when I can see it. Half-god and half-man hope... Oh, "world", you must have thought that I have seen your disguise... Alger’s fear is relieved and he begins to think about how to use the information of Banxi Port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t report the news directly, it will cause suspicion, he must patiently wait for an opportunity to let the high-level appreciation, reward, and not Will be subject to monitoring opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey can see that Mr. "Hanging Man" has a psychological journey, but he can't think that the other party can emerge in a short period of time. More thoughts and more speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the words of Mr. Fool, she is pleased to know that "Redemption Rose" is a secret organization, established by some "king of angels", and "Real Creator" has a certain relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, she also vaguely perceives the eccentricity of the "world" and finds that the most difficult member of the organization who is always reading emotions is always involved in major events, always able to find out Very important information, and constantly on the recipe, materials and characteristics, it seems that one or two weeks can hunt an extraordinary person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left Beckland and went to the sea? Or, is it still heard in Beckland? Should I tell this church about this information? Hey, Mr. "Inverted Man" has a close relationship with the Storm Church. He will do it better, and there will be no problem... Audrey oppresses the idea of ​​prying, and asks curiosity:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear "Footer", "The King of Angels" Medici's title, or which way does He belong?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned back on the chair and smiled low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red priest."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Priest? Which way is this? It sounds very close to the "Black Emperor", is it a serial 0 title? "Justice" Audrey thought excitedly and happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Priest... "The Sun" Dairik silently recited the term and found that there is no corresponding record in the history of Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s also possible that I’ve read enough information and only accepted general education... he thought with a little regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic" Firth and "Moon" Emlin listened as if they were listening to stories, and were equally interested in similar information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is that you can't brag about others and can't write into the novel! Fols regrets for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upside down" Mr. should report to it, hoping that he will not delay for too long... With his savvy, perhaps some have seen the "world" The problem, grasping the relationship between "he" and "fool", fortunately, from a long time ago, I deliberately set the "world" people to overlap with Sherlock Moriatti, giving the identity of the prostitute At the very least, Mr. "upside down" can detect this layer. I can't imagine that "the world" is actually a dummy... "Foolish" Klein raised his hand and touched his chin. He said with a smile:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See "The Fool" no longer mentions the topic just now, free from the Savior's emotions "Moon" Emlin began to face the reality of the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the lack of money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, he never considered selling those dolls, just told himself that in the future, he would save, half a year, or even a year to reward himself. Occasionally, I can buy a new set of clothes for those who have already. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the way he can think of making money is to sell some potions with magical effects, but it’s easy to bring to the people hidden in Beckland. Hidden dangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the arrangement of the ancestor. According to the truth, it is up to Mr. Nibes to provide corresponding help, but Mr. "fool" asks me to keep secret and do darkness. The Savior, who is carrying heavy weight, can't take the initiative to reveal it... After thinking for a few seconds, Emlin is two times, clearing his throat: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a question.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things are like this, suppose that there is a strong person who arranges you to investigate something, although you have successfully obtained intelligence, But for some reason, can't report to the strong, then how to continue to get support from the strong? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Emlin suddenly felt that this behavior was a bit shameful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, This is very similar to a traitor and a traitor... No, I did this for the continuation of the entire blood race. To do this, I must abandon my reputation and be puzzled. When the matter is over, the truth will be presented, and they will be moved by me..." The moon "Emlin quickly eased the feelings just now.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "Justice" Audrey, "Magic" Firth and "Sun" wear Rick and others have turned their eyes to Alger. In their minds, Mr. "Inverted Man" has a wealth of experience in this area and is the best teacher.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The Fool" Klein thinks so too.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted man" Alger swept the "moon" and snorted:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's simple, but you have to take certain risks. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin subconsciously denied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
