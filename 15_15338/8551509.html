At this time, Audrey asked quite a bit of confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just thought about it for a while and felt that she had a good ability to find people in Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, her father is the top rich man in the nobility, has a good reputation and contacts, and she herself is also very popular in the younger generation, so There are many resources in the upper middle of the society that can be used inadvertently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the two extraordinary friends she knows now also have their own circles. The "apprentice" Foers is the original clinic doctor, now a new writer, In the literary world, in the publishing industry, many people are known among doctors in the middle class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arbitrator" Hugh Dilcha, long-term assistance to the middle and lower classes to coordinate and arbitrate events, in the eastern part of Bakerland, in the labor class, in many gangs In the organization, there are many famous and secret channels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus the other extraordinary people they are exposed to, as well as other extraordinary people to expand out of the circle, the energy of finding people can not be underestimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the problem of "justice", Alger has almost no hesitation, and he replies directly without thinking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The real name of the magical item is not known, but some people know it as 'squirming hunger', and Zilingers must use a living every other day. The human soul and flesh and blood satisfy it, otherwise it will be replaced by its own master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is an important clue that can be used to find Qilingers. Audrey frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the evil items that are craving for the blood and soul of the living, she feels discomfort from the heart and is very disgusted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but in a metropolis with at least five million people, the disappearance of several homeless people will not be noticed." Alger reminded One sentence, instead, "Since getting 'squirming hunger', Zilingers has become very difficult to deal with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was originally just a 'Wind', has a good ability in the field of water, wind and weather, but later, people found that he can make the target become frenzied, can enter other people's dreams, can summon the light to purify the dead, can enhance themselves with songs It can become a different person's appearance... almost omnipotent." Alger described in considerable detail, "We suspect that these are the magical items of 'squirming hunger'..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not finish talking, quietly listening to the "sun" Dairik Berger stunned: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shepherd!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shepherd"? Sequence 5 of the "secret person" and "listener" approach? Well, there is a new elder in the "six-member parliamentary group" of the Silver City, which is "the shepherd". It is said to be strong enough to resist the strong of the sequence 4, oh, it is the evil spirit of the equivalent grade... Klein's The facial expressions changed slightly, but they were all covered in gray fog, and at this time, the audience did not pay attention to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shepherd?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shepherd?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" and "downside down" simultaneously voiced, a complete doubt, one was slightly surprised, it seems that where to hear the name "Shepherd", know some things, but But do not understand the specific details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing everyone’s eyes cast on themselves, Dairik was a little bit flustered. He was silent and restrained, sad and sullen, and he was just a teenager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was stuttering and explained:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean, 'downside people' The enumerated features are very similar to the extraordinary ability of the 'Shepherd' sequence profession. Every 'Shepherd' can swallow other people's souls, including grievances and evil spirits, and drive them in a unique way. Using their certain abilities is like grazing a lamb for the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, no one knows how much the 'Shepherd' has, this one It depends on how many extraordinary souls they have swallowed, and this makes them look terrible, almost equal to the high sequence of strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But some people suspect that there is a limit to the number of souls that the 'shepherd' can swallow and graze, but they can be replaced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original "shepherd" means This ah... The sequence of the "Aurora" masters is as strange as ever... No wonder they believe in the object of "real creator", no, "fallen creator"... Klein is stunned, but no nod, it has long been known Look like that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he sighed in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun", you really It’s just a child. This is a very important news. The important information can be exchanged for valuable things. You just said it! Say it out...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the ability to show off the magical item "squirming hunger" and the sequence 5 "Shepherd" is very similar... Will many seals be similar to a sequence of occupations, the kind of out of control... I don’t know which seal series "2-049" the Antignus family puppet will look like... Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the explanation of "the sun", "downside down" Alger seems to have solved a certain mystery and nodded, momentarily silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey asked more curiously: "Which sequence is the shepherd? What is the sequence?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The secret praying person' approach, 5." Klein seized the opportunity and said no words to indicate that he knew everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Secret people'... Aurora..." Audrey suddenly thought of Mr. A, who was suspected of "Aurora" Suddenly a bit heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She began to think seriously, thinking about what price she could use in exchange for Mr. Fool’s shot, and easily solved the disgusting guy, but I thought about it and didn’t expect it. How to impress Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the big people close to the gods are not so easy to move...the items and things they are interested in are not much... Audrey sighs in her heart . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being, she gave up the urge to "Sun" and thanked him for letting everyone make new speculations about "squirming hunger" so that they can make A more reasonable and effective response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., I am willing to accept this commission, but I am not guaranteed to find 'Hurricane Lieutenant' Qilingus." Audrey turned Looking at the opposite side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no better answer than this. Regardless of whether you are successful or not, as long as you try, I will pay you a certain amount of money, such as some secrets. Knowledge and intelligence, and if successful, perhaps I can directly provide the main material of your 'reader', of course, if we have to know what it is.” Alger promised with a rare generosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete." Audrey snorted and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, with the permission and help of Klein, Alger has a portrait of Kiringus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the seven major pirate generals has a distinctive wide chin, brown hair behind the head of the ancient warrior's hair, dark green eyes It seems as if you are smiling, but it is very cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discussing the discussion and sharing the shared information, the sorrower of the sorghum, Klein, smiled and announced that it is ending today, and then saw "justice." "And "hanging people" Ma Li got up and saluted, saw the "sun" slowly mimicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed his right hand and interrupted the contact, but he did not leave immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of Silver, Berg Home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick looked at the familiar arrangement around him and looked at the dark sky outside the lightning, and it was a bit stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he quickly woke up, looking for parchment and quill, brushed the "singer" formula that was forcibly memorized . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repeatedly read it several times and finally confirmed that there was no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric is not worried that he has a "singer" formula and becomes an alternative to the extraordinary, will be suspected by the upper class of Silver City, because in the previous In the sub-exploration, members of the elite team are more or less from the monsters, from the abandoned and destroyed cities to get some recipes, materials and strange items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
