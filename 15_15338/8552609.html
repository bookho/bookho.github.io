			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the "fool" simply mentions some simple common sense in the Russell diary, "downside down" Alger may not be determined to pay " Remuneration, the answer, is because the simple description destroys curiosity, and on the other hand, because he always guards the exchange with the "fool", which reminds him of the examples of dealing with the evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, he knows the content of the so-called simple common sense, which has a strong interest in it, but can not understand some of the descriptions, let alone the actual, Deeply grasped, so it is difficult to contain but absolutely respectfully ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool's, what kind of reward do you want?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm! "Justice" Audrey is a small but high-frequency nod, saying that this is what she wants to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik still remains silent, without extra body language, but unconsciously looks at the "fool" look but explains everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who is waiting for a similar response, smiles: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The secret meeting..." "The hanging man" Alger whispered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is no stranger to this term, he has received remuneration, and explained to the "Justice" many hidden organizations, including the secret meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey and Dairik are both subconsciously frowning, one because the understanding of the secret seminar is limited to those that have been told by the "downside down" One is because I have never heard of this organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of "the sun", Klein has long anticipated, not surprising, in his speculation, the area where Silver City is located has become "abandoned by God." The ground should be at a certain stage of the Third Age after the birth of the first slate to the second slate, and may even be the direct cause or performance of the Cataclysm, while the Charato family is in the fourth Ji Cai was on the stage of history, and the creation of the secret seminar was the second half of the Quaternary. There was no possibility of coincidence between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the "Sun" knows the secret society, Klein will be scared, and will have to overthrow some speculations, rebuild the city of silver, and abandon the gods. The place, the cognition of the Chalatu family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a dozen seconds, "downside down" Alger looked at the "fool" in the fog, discretion to speak:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will accept this commission to collect and explore matters related to the essay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can advance Is paying 'remuneration'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of a suspected god is not surprising to an ancient and secret organization, Alger There is no doubt about this. More importantly, after many gatherings, he gradually got a guess in his heart that the state of Mr. Fool is not perfect, He Perhaps in a certain dilemma, the various attempts he made and the actions of his deaf people on the North and South continents were to free him from bondage and not to be restricted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may even involve the big secret that the Seven Gods are no longer coming to the real world after the Quaternary... Alger’s thought flashed, and there was some trepidation, feeling that he entered The realm of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the request of "downside down", Klein leaned back on the back of the chair and slammed it first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the intelligence you collect exceeds the value of the answer, I will compensate you extra."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for what happens beyond the value of the answer, of course, by the respected "fool" Mr., he has the ability to pay extra compensation, even if he is incapable, it is not... Klein In the heart silently added a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey suddenly brightened her eyes and raised her hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I hope to join this deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, his main goal is actually Miss Justice, because the other is Beckland’s head snake, and it’s also mixed into several The circle of extraordinary people, in the "land of hope" is more informed than the first time to the capital, more than the long-term active in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Based on the revelation gained from previous divination, Klein believes that the clues of the Secret Society will appear in Beckland, not elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik listened silently and thought about the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing Use the compensation accumulated before to exchange the answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the previous tripartite transaction, he used the "reader" formula of sequence 8 to only switch to sequence 9. The "Singer" formula, Kline promised to compensate him, and his choice at the time was to accumulate and prepare for the subsequent potion formula and main materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded and said that he had prepared an explanation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The similar sequence refers to several ways in which high sequences can be replaced with each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I give an example, the sequence of the 'Death' route 5' gatekeeper ', not only can be promoted normally, but also can choose the 'giant' approach, which is the sequence of the 'God of War' route 4 'hunter"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It will not bring the risk of getting out of control, nor will it accumulate madness. It is not the same as taking the wrong medicine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, if it is not a similar sequence, half crazy It is the best result."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it interchangeable?" "Justice" Audrey blurted out, surprised and delighted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is surprised that the sequence approach is not completely fixed, not just going down the road, not having to pay for half-madness The price that can no longer be promoted from now on, there are special circumstances in the path of the twenty-two gods, and there are similar sequences! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she is pleased that she has a chance to pick in the future, just like picking interesting products at Phillips department store, it is a beautiful Experience! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out to be the case... Alger is silent and feels that he wants to understand a lot of things and solves many of the doubts accumulated in his personal experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This message is really worth it! It is worthy of Mr. "The Fool". The so-called simple common sense is enough to make most of the low- and medium-sequences of the extraordinary people shocked and lost their benefits! He secretly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik was a little disappointed because he didn't intend to change the sequence at all, he wanted to be the "sun" that illuminates the darkness and drives away the curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he quickly recalled a past in the Silver City:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The former chief, a strongest who is most likely to break through the limits of the "hunting monster", built a mausoleum for himself, went deep into the mausoleum, and then moved into it as a home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, he appeared less and less until the door to the mausoleum could no longer be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the people of the Silver City thought that the chief had a problem when he was promoted, became a madman, was close to losing control, and eventually solved himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now combined with the description of "fool", "the sun" suddenly thinks of another possibility:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chief may be trying to advance to a similar sequence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an experience exploring the depths of the darkness, he obtained the corresponding formula for the "Death" route, and the mausoleum may be a special requirement... but in the end he Still failed? But why didn't it become a monster? What happened to him in the dark mausoleum? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver City does not have a sequence of potions after the "Hunter"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the thoughts, Dairik was suddenly awakened by the pretending voice of Miss Justice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
