			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, outside the steam train station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falth wears a top-down fine black gauze, a hat with blue flowers, standing in the foyer of the subway entrance, waiting for the teacher Dorian Gray arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fine rain in the street, the cold wind blowing from the bottom, made the writer a little shivering, feeling that she underestimated the spring of Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know how Hugh is doing it all the time all year round. Hey, she said that before her father died, she was not willing to take a bed at home. In addition to going to the bathroom, both servants and servants were sent to the side. Now they can go out early every day and go home at night. No matter the rain or the fog, they have not changed. They have completed one commission after another and arrested one after another. An all-nighter." With this thought, Fols couldn't help but admire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week, the "Sheriff of the Sheriff" not only paid off the debt, but even saved 200 pounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to be said that the "Sheriff" is the most suitable career for bounty hunters. Of course, the scope of choice is limited to the low sequence...Folse's thoughts Just about to spread out indiscriminately, the eyes that looked out to the outside suddenly swept the familiar figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a medium-sized gentleman, wearing Lun’s most popular black dress, wearing a half-height silk hat, and his shoulders are rarely wide and almost exaggerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the teacher of Fols, one of the few remaining members of the Abraham family, Dorian Gray Abraham. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls a happy heart, immediately propped up the umbrella and greeted the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the streets with lots of pedestrians, she hasn’t really moved closer, but she has a line of sight with Dorian, and she sees the teacher raise her right hand and clenches her fist. The first button in the black dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is... dangerous! Fols's expression changed his eyes unchanged, his mouth smirked and turned his eyes to a young gentleman who was behind him. Then, nothing happened. The more Lean, Gray, went ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old family has unimaginable accumulations in all aspects, and Dorian Gray has already agreed with Fols in certain emergency situations. The cipher and the gesture, the meaning of the action just now is very simple, that is, stay away, don't get close! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man behind was looked at by the lazy mature girl, and then instinctively sorted out the clothes and pressed the hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just finished these actions, and Firth has crossed him and continues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain is still rolling, and Firth circled around and boarded a rental carriage and went straight to the hat-trick hotel located at 22 Hope Road, Jowood. This is the residence that Dorian Gray has booked in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mysterious circle for many years, Foss has had a lot of experience and calmly asked for a room facing the street, standing in front of the window and observing the hotel. Guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, she saw Dorian Gray walking off the carriage and entering the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falth quickly turned around and came to the corner of the stairs, obsessively observing which room the teacher was taken to by the waiter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait for a moment, she took off her hat, messed up her hair, and then walked to the door of Room 2016, screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her plan is very simple, if the teacher's response is no problem, then enter the room to communicate, if it is not normal, pretend that he is going to the wrong room or trying The girl standing on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the door slowly opened, and Dorian looked at the students in front of him and looked at the sides of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he raised his right arm, Zhang Wuzhi, press the second class button in the formal dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that it is uncontrolled and the exception has passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls breathed a sigh of relief and flashed into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher, what happened right now?" she asked with some concern and concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian closed the door and smiled bitterly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw an acquaintance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sighed and added one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was what he used to The student, who later followed the "traveler" Boutis rebellion, made the upper layer of the Abraham family almost extinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Dorian’s knowledge, his student should also join the “Aurora”, probably one of the 22 gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did he do? Is he very good?" asked Firth curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorion was silent for a few seconds, slightly revealing one point:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, Lawrence, Both Lauro, Anlisa, belong to the same organization, which suffered a serious blow from the betrayal of some people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the betrayers. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not mention the family, nor did he mention the contradiction between the blood members and the disciples, so that Fols has unnecessary emotional substitution.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's awful! "Firth suddenly remembered Mrs. Anlisa, who was very good to herself, and Mr. Lawrence, who was kind and friendly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, don't talk about this unpleasant thing. Dorian took a piece of paper that had been folded several times from the inner pocket of the garment and handed it to Folls. "The 'Astrology' potion formula, you have more digested the 'apprentice' than the 'apprentice'. I expected this to be my biggest surprise in the last decade. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I went to the circus. "Falth didn't hide it, and even thought it was something that could be shown off.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, she unfolded the paper and planned to browse the "Astrology" potion recipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Dorian was pleased to nod:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, because before Loss, I don't have the main material of the 'Astrology' potion here, you will be the final test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, I have prepared a gift for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said while A slap-sized note was taken from the left pocket, and the outer casing looked hard and copper-green, which was quite old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This note consists of three types of paper, one is browned, the amount is rare, one is yellow brown, like parchment, about ten, one is Jane A simple plain white paper, above the cover, there is a line of words written in ancient Fossack:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came, I saw, I Record."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folse's gaze removed from the "Astrology" potion formula, looking at the note, recognizing it is Mr. Lawrence The relic is the one that I sent to Port Pritz to the teacher! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian laughed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you should be familiar with it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Folly nodded, he sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is A very powerful magical item, in the kind of things I have seen, can rank in the top five. This is not to say that it is more powerful than the last few, but that its negative effects are easily resolved, and the two aspects are comprehensive and very Valuable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is it called? What is the negative effect?" Fuls was a little excited and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolrian strokes the notes and covers the road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's called 'Lemano's trip Note ', however, we prefer to call it 'Lemano's magic book'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This 'magic book' allows you to see something Record it at the same time as extraordinary ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will be fixed on one of the notes and saved for a long time. You can use it whenever you want, but you have to remember that after using it once, the corresponding page will be blank again, waiting for you to record again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It sounds great." Fols has a feeling of being dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as I see the extraordinary ability, I can record it and use it once? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, isn't this another "shepherd"? The shepherd in the mouth of the little "sun"... well, limited to a single battle prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if I can record the extraordinary ability of the demigod. If I can, the prepared single battle is even worse than the "Shepherd"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian seems to have heard her voice and explained in detail:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be said It corresponds to the sequence 6' record officer of our 'apprentice' pathway. The extraordinary ability higher than this sequence is not sure to record, there is a probability of failure, the higher the height, the greater the failure, and the effect is only half of the original "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the experience of the previous users, in the face of the extraordinary ability of the sequence 5, the success may not be low, but to the sequence 4, to the level of the demigod, It's quite difficult. It may not be successful once in ten times, and I don't think any demigod will show you again and again. If it is still an enemy, he has killed you ten times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you seen it? This burnt-yellow paper is dedicated to recording the extraordinary ability of divine influence, for a total of three, that is, even if you really Fortunately, only three semi-divine-level extraordinary abilities can be recorded and used once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it sounds like a lot of restrictions, let this "travel note" "The power can't be played, but for two people, there is no such obstacle. One is the lucky one. The other is the one that relies on a large organization. There is a kind of help from the gods... I thought of praying to Mr. Fool, asking him to show his ability, letting himself record, and immediately felt that it was too embarrassing, and he apologized in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, she sincerely hopes that the most intimate "invisible" lady in the Tarot will become a demigod as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian did not find that the idea of ​​Fulth deviated and continued: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The kind of parchment that can record the extraordinary ability of sequence 5 and sequence 6, a total of 10 pages, the effect is the majority of the original, 70 to 80%; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recording the extraordinary ability below sequence 6 for a total of 25 pages, the effect is close to the original, but still worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of some of the previous things, there are only five pages left in the magic book, you can study it yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian settled down and said with a serious expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before giving it to you, I must solemnly remind that it has a negative effect, every time After use, it will make you lost, you will encounter all kinds of dangerous and lost, you must extract your own blood and evenly spread it on the cover to eliminate this effect.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, don't underestimate the kind of get lost, be sure to deal with it as soon as possible. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, teacher. "Fuls seriously responded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dollyan is about to hand "Lemano's travel notes" to Firth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my gift. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher is so good...Fuls licked his lower lip and blurted out and debuted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What is your betrayal student? What does it look like? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is a chance, I want to avenge you and Mr. Lawrence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Don't think about this, you are much weaker than him. When he betrayed us, he is already a 'record officer' and may even become a 'traveler' now." Dorian said solemnly, "However, you really need to remember. Live him to avoid him, his name is Louis Wien, I will wait to draw his appearance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
