			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hai Wang...when I heard the serial name of Yann Courtman, Klein first thought of the complete name of "The Lord of the Storm" :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The King of the Air, the Emperor of the Sea, the Scourge of the Lord, the God of the Storm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sequence 3 is "Sea King"... Sequence 0 contains the elements of the Sea Emperor, is it quite corresponding... I don't know what the sequence of the "storm" route is called 0... Klein looks out the window again, only to see the weather is still a little It was sullen, but the morning sun had fallen, the tides had receded, and the rain had completely stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought back, analyzing the situation from the information disclosed by Daniz:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The name of the drug is “Sea King”, that is to say, the corresponding sequence 3 demigods and saints have to play the “sea king”, and all plays have a premise that they have all the necessary abilities...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a "sea king", even if there is a scope limit, it is definitely a strong dominator in the sea area controlled by itself. You can walk freely on the seabed and you can happily pick up the tsunami. The sea rises and can control marine life... In the "home" battle, they absolutely have the ability to press all the gods at the same level... "King of the Five Seas" and "Mysterious Queen" are also at this level, just because of the different degrees of digestion, Have different mastery of strength, and have a certain distinction between strength and weakness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter what, as long as they are at sea, they will have a hard time winning "Sea King"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp With the ability of "Sea King" to cooperate with the ocean environment, if you have not seen the true gods such as "eternal yang" and "real creator", worship him, believe him, pray to him, it is not too difficult to understand. Things...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the gods in the original worship may be this level, the probability is not even angels...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, "not looking directly at God" refers to the true god. Before the "Poseidon" Cavi Tuva did not give me this feeling, Amon's avatar did not, of course, not sure Whether the body of "King of Angels" also has attributes that cannot be directly viewed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is on the verge of collapse, and now it is also the sequence of 3 levels of "Poseidon" One is the "Sea King" in good condition and can use the seal at any time. The outcome can be imagined. Yann Courtman can always The madness of Kavitova does not allow seawater to inundate Bayam, and does not allow the entire Blue Mountains and the above cities to become lost seabed remnants...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Wait a few more days, the last madness of Cavitowan, completely disintegrated and dissipated, and the problem will be solved. This is the simplest and most effective treatment solution, and will not bring any panic atmosphere, even most people here. Nothing can be detected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are some problems. First of all, there can be no other accidents. The archaeologist of Latsia does not know what to do on the island of Symim. The demise of "Poseidon", the "Moss Assassination Society" or "Element Dawn" behind her may take the opportunity to seek something. This is the biggest hidden danger. The amount, the Governor's Office, the military side, there should also be there. The high sequence is strong, this is the kingdom's colonial fulcrum in the waters of Central Sonia... Things don't get too bad...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is those fanatical believers When Cavitowan became more and more mad and more and more dying, they would become a sacrifice with great probability, just like the straw at the harvest, and the fall of a cluster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is not too bad development for the storm church, the most devout pagans die with their gods, can save the follow-up screening The trouble of handling is not so pious, it will not be greatly affected, and there is the possibility of transformation in the future... The only shortcoming is that there will be a shortage of labor in the Rosde Islands for a long time. This kind of problem is troublesome, but as long as Biting your teeth can also be solved. Therefore, the storm church, "Sea King" Yann Courtman will sit down and ignore the situation... Huh, in the area where the locals gather, in the slums, I do not know how many people will die... ... Klein's thoughts were suddenly interrupted by the uniform footsteps and the high-altitude roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He instinctively looked up and saw several muzzles exposed. The dark blue painted airship that protruded from the machine gun passed over the front and flew to different areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the street, the Ron soldiers in red jackets, white trousers, and black leather boots squatted with rifles, dragged artillery, lined up neatly, one after another. through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the colony... Klein is inexplicably touched and sighs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how long the church can kill the sea snake, find the place hidden before it, there is definitely a treasure, there are countless valuables..." Daniz, who is a treasure hunter, suddenly spoke, some expectation, and some regrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His attitude has become very fast, has reduced the "Poseidon" into a sea snake, and used "it" to replace it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church does nothing, it is suppressed, waiting for a few days, you can see that Cavitowa has fallen... Of course, the people of the storm church may not have This patience, especially I heard that Yann Courtman’s job is a senior deacon of “the punitive person”, but the islands are solo overseas. In order to unify the power of affairs, they have become part-time cardinals, and the acting style may be closer to “criminal punishment”. "... where is the hidden place of Cavitowa? The ruins are almost integrated into the spiritual world, and you want to find something that is not that simple, otherwise it will not be able to survive until today... Thinking of it, Klein suddenly came up with an inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to find the remains of Cavitowa’s hiding, it’s difficult to start from the real world, even if the other party has fallen, it’s not a year and a half, unless you get More accurate intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you start with the spirit world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual world is even more difficult to locate, but it is not completely impossible. The "Silver Snake" Will. Anthony has performed once with his folded paper crane. ...... What to do, I still have no idea, but it doesn't matter. I can ask Mr. Azke. The field of death controls some of the authority of the spiritual world... The underworld or the hell is the ancestor of the dead bird, Gary Carrie. The ancient death god was opened up in the spiritual world... Klein’s thoughts flashed, and the old and exquisite copper whistle was taken out, and he sipped his mouth and took a sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that even if he returns to the bedroom or enters the bathroom, the messenger’s huge body will inevitably be discovered by Daniz, who is not inspirational, so Did not evade each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz is imagining the treasure of "Poseidon" Cavitowa, and suddenly feels that the neck is a bit cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels a sense of heart, busy turning on the vision, looking to the side and rear, I saw a white bone squirting from the floor, throwing up, forming A head illusion penetrates the huge ceiling of the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a slight bow, and the two dark flames could be seen faintly even across the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure of its huge body makes Deniz leaping sideways, half-bow body, gathering red flames in the palm of the right palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What monster? Daniz looked at Gelman Spalo, and saw him holding a copper whistle, his head lifted up, and quietly confronted the sly monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked up at the huge messenger, and the huge messenger looked down at him, and the two sides seemed to have solidified there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Hey, too urgent, haven’t written yet, just summoned the messenger... I’m waiting for it to be in the first place, or Go back, wait for me to come back... I am now Gelman Sparrow, yes, German Sparrow! Klein didn't say anything, indifference took back the line of sight, and the action didn't slow down to find the pen and paper, and the brush began to write. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He roughly described the "King of the Seas" Cavitowa, but hidden himself was almost possessed, must use the details of the fog to disperse the other The remains of hiding have broken into the dream of just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...may be able to find a way out of the spiritual world, but I lack the knowledge and hope to get your guidance."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein folded the paper and turned his head and found that the messenger’s palm was not ready to be held. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pretended not to find anything, and lost the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger was still for a second before he spread his hand and caught the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s body collapsed, the bones fell and fell into the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, what is this?" Daniz finally made a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
