			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 8, 'Teacher', is good at inducing the evil desires of everyone's heart, excels at intensifying contradictions, provoking conflicts, creating bloody cases..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The description is not detailed enough. It seems that the night-time person is not too familiar with the potion's ability...but it does match the characteristics of the nickname tragedy... Klein's visual shift , looking to the "teacher" corresponding sequence 9:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 9, 'Assassin', can change the body in a short time, get feather-like lightness, and Curing the eagle's vision and dark vision, every 'Assassin' is good at hiding in the shadows, with a dexterous pace and the ability to explode all power within a single blow..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the description, Klein once again fell into deep confusion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assassin"... "Assassin" advanced is " Instructor?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is as strange as the advancement of the "Divination" is a profession that is good at skillful fighting...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The sequence of the sequence is improved in order, very normal, such as "audience", why do some sequence paths violate the intuition and logic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, not necessarily, maybe some of the hidden commonalities I didn't find...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, "Assassin" and "Teacher" will bring disaster to others...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the "Divination", I can't figure out how! Hey, is it the pulse of Gandalfan’s father? After adding a little auxiliary magic, all other skill points are all piled up in strength and skill? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein silently shook his head and shook his head silently, turning the information to the part of the secret organization "Knowledge" involved in the "teacher." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Intellectual Society, the fifth era, the hidden organization that emerged in the early days of this epoch, they believed that the spirit is the essence of human beings, and the flesh is only a cage that binds the spirit. People will be evil, or they will be affected by the flesh. They must acquire spiritual knowledge, let the spirit gradually liberate from the flesh, and then pass through the layers of the stars to finally get rid of the material world and return to the purest and true self. Eternal redemption."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, many extreme members of the GIC have targeted many others to create a bloody case... It can be seen that there are two kinds of sequence pathways they have mastered. One is the 'apprentice', the 'master of tricks', and the rare ones are assassins and instigators. There is no evidence to show that there is no evidence. Will have the potions above sequence 7 and sequence 7."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How the knowledge is built is not known, only through two sequences Ways to analyze their possible sources First, 'apprentice', 'master of tricks', this is easily reminiscent of the Abraham family of the Quaternary Tudor dynasty, does not rule out the possibility of the long-marriage of the Tabala family with the Abraham family, second, 'Assassin' and 'Teacher', pointing to the witch sect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham, Tamara, Antigonus, Chalatu, Solomon Empire The Tujia dynasty blood emperor, the Terencer empire, and the Jacob family and the Amon family mentioned in the "downside down"... There are really many secrets hidden in the history of the Quaternary burial. There may be a lot of truth... Klein is amazed and deeply aware that the history of the Quaternary is covered with heavy fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just the outline seen through the fog, people can’t stop to be scared. It seems that you can imagine an extraordinary era, you can imagine a blood color and Amazingly dancing, horror and distortion of the era of singing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein breathed a sigh of relief, turned over and over, and did not find the corresponding description of "The Witch Sect." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his head and looked at the old Neil who was using the filter paper to toss the coffee, and sincerely requested:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Neil, what is the organization of the witch sect, I did not see their introduction in the information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil is not in a hurry Take care of him, toss a sneak sigh and laugh: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are not many things about the witch sect. I only know that they believe in the 'original witch' and believe that this hidden existence is the true successor of the creator. It is the original one born from chaos and born from the main body of creation. ', will also be the 'finalist' that ends everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their sequence is related to this, because to get the gift of 'the original witch', Approaching this secret existence, so the top is female, which is why they are called witch sects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More situations don't belong to me This kind of form that formal members can reach, I only heard that the witches have a mission to spread disasters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributing disasters...This is in line with the "Assassin" and The common point implied by the "teacher"...but the future of Mr. Tries is worrying. The follow-up potion seems to be more suitable for women... Klein's head is slightly, and the process of reading the materials continues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading, he found that the hidden organization is much more than he imagined, but after careful consideration for a while, I feel that this is very normal. After all, the world has been so many years. The history of the precipitation, once again appeared in an era of extraordinary power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the information provided, Klein divides those hidden organizations into three categories in the age method:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The first is the ancient organization that was born in the Quaternary, including but not limited to the "Moss accompaniment", "the secret society", and the "believing blood" of the followers, only one sentence of "worry" sect". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the Fifth Age, the secret organization that was born in the early days of this era. They are more or less related to the terrible families and sects of the Quaternary. For example, "smart associations", such as the "spiritual group" that believes in death, such as the "life school" based on the inheritance of masters and apprentices, and the "rose school" known as the bloody sacrifice in the circle of extraordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is the new organization that has appeared in the last one or two hundred years, including "Aurora", "Iron Blood Cross", "Element Dawn", and Klein's earliest I heard of the "mental alchemy club." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there are still some organizations that have not done anything big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Banson and Melissa certainly can't imagine how dangerous this world is, not just war..." Klein shook his head and laughed, stacking those secrets. Put it neatly and push it to the old Neil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he silently added a sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Tarot will thousand Don't "list on" ah...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil didn't even think of sitting in front of a secret organization leader, laughing and taking information, went to Chanis door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat there, thinking about whether he wanted to divination of the "teacher" Tries's whereabouts, but only for a few seconds, he gave up This plan, after all, only knows the appearance of the other party and a name that does not know whether it is true or false. If you can grasp the whereabouts, it will not be called "Divination", and it will be called "Prophet"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old Neil came back, Klein converges and continues his own occultal course to master more of the ritual magic "format." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day, he spent all his studies and exercises, did not participate in the search for the "teacher" Tries joint action, only heard from Beckland The seal "2-049" will be delayed due to some special factors, which is to be determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because yesterday’s divination earned nearly 2 Sule’s banknotes, Klein spent 10 pence on his way home to buy a bucket of 2 liters of Enma Special beer, gave Melissa a freshly baked lemon cake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein, I know that you value our attention, but it is not necessary, there is no need to always spend money on these things." Benson looked at the beer The small wooden barrel, considering the language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa stood by, nodding her head and nodding her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the difference in our spending habits... Klein sighs with a sigh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
