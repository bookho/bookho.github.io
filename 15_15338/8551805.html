			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are guardians and a group of poor people who are always fighting against danger and madness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Dunn's words echoed in the house of the old Neil, echoing between the floor, the walls and the ceiling, which showed signs of corrosion, echoing in Klein's mind and mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was never a moment before, which made him more impressive than the one he said now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that he may not be able to forget this feeling for the rest of his life, even if he returns to Earth in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the almost solid atmosphere, Dunn walked toward the "corpse" of the old Neil, half-squatted, and took a white from the upper pocket of the black trench coat. The handkerchief covered the pair of dark red, crystal, painful eyes. At this moment, Klein’s eyes saw the piano’s buttons stop jumping, and there was a nearly transparent figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... Klein, who opened the mind as early as the door, grabbed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not find this strange "spirit" at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it interfered by the spirit of the old Neil or was it affected by his ability to get out of control? Klein looked at the invisible figure and quickly evaporated, completely disappearing into his own eyes, vaguely understand something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the feeling of heavy repression, he heard the captain command: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You search carefully Seoul's home, looking for clues that may exist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." When Klein spoke, he was kept in his voice for a few seconds. It was so hoarse, so low, just like having a bad cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Luo Yao answered with a voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is almost the same as me... Both nostrils are blocked... Klein looks at the female teammate who has never had any expression, as if I met her for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the cane on the umbrella stand in the foyer, bypassed the seal "3-0611", walked into the living room with a heavy step, went up to the second floor Find a clue in one bedroom and one bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil will regularly hire short-term employees to clean the room, so there is not a lot of bachelor-specific mess here, everything is neat and orderly, there seems to be a real Hostess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, Klein found some manuscripts on the bedroom of the old Neil’s bedroom, which was cluttered with some strange and weird rituals: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life refining."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Required materials include: Spring of the Elf (Sunia Island Golden Spring) 100 ml of spring water, 50 grams of star crystal, half a pound of gold, 5 grams of phlogiston, 30 grams of hematite... and a lot of living blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Under the blood of the living, the old Neil commented: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can consider taking my own, once and for all, save with ritual magic. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can consider taking my own... Klein closed his eyes and his fingers crumpled the draft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday at 9 am, the moon, Rafael Cemetery . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wore a black dress and shirt, holding a silver cane, standing quietly in the corner of the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His chest pockets, a neatly folded white handkerchief, holding a quiet and quiet sleep in the palm of your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the yellow-brown soil covered with a shovel and a shovel, wearing a long black dress and wearing a white flower, Roshan whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Can anyone tell me, is this true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I get out of control, why should I take the potion, why should I become an extraordinary person, why should I have a complaint? Why do the souls have monsters, why can't they have a safer way, why, why, why..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened silently until the old Neil's coffin Covered by mud until the traces of his existence are buried deep in the tomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the goddess protect you." He drew a red moon on his chest, then stepped forward and bent over to put the bunch of deep sleep flowers in his hand. In front of the tombstone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the goddess bless you." Dunn and Frye and others circled clockwise at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked up and straightened up and saw the black and white photo on the tombstone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wearing his classic black bonnet, the exposed hair is mottled, the wrinkles in the corners of the eyes and mouth are deep, and the dark red eyes are slightly cloudy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is so calm, no more sad, no more pain, no more fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a line of epitaph inscribed below the photo, which comes from what Neil wrote in his recent diary:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can't save her, go with her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breeze of the morning blew through, the cold of the Raphael cemetery Quiet and silently infected everyone present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, Klein took the list signed by the captain and went to Armory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed open the half-covered door and saw Bright, who had a thick black beard, sitting behind the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein clearly stunned and then handed over the claim form:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten ordinary bullets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, he glanced over the silver tin can on the table, and the nose seemed to smell the hand-grinding coffee. The taste, the ear seems to have heard the words of implicit smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can you wait until you have extra money to go? You can write an application Dunn, let him approve the fee!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright looked at the eye Ryan’s expression, sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I can guess your feelings, I can’t believe that Neil left us like this, sometimes I even think that this may be a dream created by the captain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This may be the fate of many nights." Klein smiled back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this incident, he has a lot of disappointment and resentment against the top of the church who concealed the "playing the law." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that such tragedies are getting less and less, may the goddess bless you." Brett painted a red moon on his chest, took the claim form, got up Walked into the rear of the arsenal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of gunpowder pervades the surroundings, and Klein vents the target in front of him until the brass bullets are exhausted, he packs himself and rides the trackless public carriage. Came to the home of the fighting teacher Gao Wen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He practiced one group after another in a self-abuse manner until he was stopped by Gao Wen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
