			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless fog is quietly suspended, and the first time on the bronze long table is a slight rub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein changed his sitting position and became more and more solemnly scrutinizing the details of the evil spirits, and increasingly believed that he and Miss Sharon completely ignored Raft at that moment. The possibility of Pound's problem: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the extraordinary ability of the 'Red Priest' route 'conspiracy'?<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this is closer to the deception of the normal category, only the supernatural power in the subtleties, so even if I enter the mysterious space above the fog, I will not passively perceive it. Blind, must think and analyze actively, in order to find the problem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is not from Mr. Azick who knows that the evil spirits are suspected of falling red Angel Medici, I will not feel that there is a problem at all. It’s impossible to hire Miss 'Magician' to go to Williams Street to find unusual signs..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a few minutes, Klein has a paper pen ready Use divination to confirm your guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought for a while, he finally wrote the "Dream Divination" statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Rafft Pound from the Baron's current situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the crimson round pen, Klein holds the paper with the divination statement, backwards Rely on the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first recalled the information of Raft Pound, which he had mastered, and then closed his eyes, meditated on sentences, and entered meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s thoughts were quick and peaceful, and quickly fell into a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray world, the intermittent scene flashed over and eventually settled at the house at 29 West Vilas Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the warm living room, Raft Pound wore a cotton pyjama and a wine glass with a red liquid, standing quietly at the window, looking across the Baker Rand Police Headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plaque from the baron's two plaques is invented, the puffy eye bags are stained with black and black, and the wrinkles on the forehead and mouth are deeper than He is in his forties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His pupils are not serious but not normal spread, cheeks are red, look funny, and Klein has seen something slightly different before. Change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, he had a problem here... Klein left the dream and considered how to deal with the evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that he has a thinking inertia in this respect. In the case of Miss Sharon, his first reaction is to report! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but how do you report it? Klein pondered for a while, with the appearance of the "world" and asked him to pray: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Responsible way to deliver the following message to the goddess of the night Church and Church of the God of Steam and Machinery.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The message is: Fossack and Intis's senior spies gathered at Williams Street for unknown purposes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remuneration, £100."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Klein’s repeated deliberation, directly It is indeed more likely to attract the attention of the church and the military, such as the "King of the Angels", the "Red Priest", the Medici family and the remains of the Tudor dynasty, but it is also easy for the "Magic" Miss Fols, who is responsible for reporting, to be The official organization is eyeing, and it is extremely dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saying that "Fossack and Intis’s senior spies gather at Williams Street" is not only relatively soft, but also a matter of ordinary extraordinary people who have the opportunity to perceive. It is enough to alert the church and the military, send the corresponding strong, and take the most effective means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for what was detected in the follow-up, it is their contribution and has nothing to do with the reporter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looking for Mr. Azick’s option, Klein had considered it, but eventually decided to give up, because the evil spirit was suspected to be the king of angels, very dangerous. Mr. Azke, who is still in the recovery phase, may not be able to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly addicted, Klein turned the scenes that appeared out into streamers and invested in the deep red stars that symbolize Miss Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Jowood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls received a reply from Mr. "World" and heard it one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that a senior spy of Fossack and Intis?" She was shocked to say that she believed that the material she provided could not reason at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she quickly relieved that the reason why Mr. "World" suspected that Williams Street was abnormal was because he received the corresponding senior spy intelligence. After confirming that there were Fussac and Intis, it was very simple to draw conclusions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post the message to the Church of the Night and the Steam Church? Isn't this a euphemism for reporting? Unfortunately, I can't go on the sidelines, otherwise I can definitely see a good show... Fols is no stranger to reporting. After all, her roommate and friend is a bounty hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly got the idea and decided to hand over the report to the experienced Hugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the bedroom, she saw Hugh sitting on the sofa, leaning forward to look at the target document, and occasionally raising her hand to grab the messy yellow hair, it seems Extremely serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls took the decorative items and handed them over to the sofa:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Come on, eat a piece of cake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the eye-washed cake with cream, the thoughts are not scattered, and the palms are caught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Firth’s wrist was turned over and the cake in the palm had turned into a golden fabric flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surprise?" she asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happing can’t help but turn your eyes on it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Stop your performance, I am more Hope is food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I have something to entrust you, £70." Fols smiled and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary treatment of evil spirits, Klein returns to the real world, by the way A ceremony was held to bring the radio tickers, which had been placed on the fog for several days, back to the first-class master bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lay down on the bed and recovered his energy with meditation until he was awakened by the sound of swearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Klein opened his eyes, the red moonlight outside the window was already shining, and the tulle enveloped the dimly lit room, shrouded the desk and spit on the desk. Unreal white paper radio ticker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This really has the feeling of a ghost film horror film... Unfortunately, there is a magic mirror with no lower limit and no lower limit... Klein turns over and sits away. In the past, I saw a line of Lunwen on the illusory white paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great existence above the spiritual world, your loyal servant Arrods has Arrive and say hello to you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have something to test me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, hey, this is called talking! This is called professional! At this moment, Klein wants to bring fat pharmacist Dakwell into the knowledge. The art of talking under the mirror.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obvious that I have something to ask about it, and the result becomes that I am testing it, and it also comes with a question... Klein controlled the upturned corner of his mouth and replied in a low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that the ignorant shallow Arodes is ready. "In the voice of the sly, not only the Lun text appeared on the illusory white paper, but also a smiley face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already a text It’s a prototype... This guy has evolved so fast... Klein asked directly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
