			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayr Hassan echoes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, it's hard to imagine 'divination' The follow-up will be 'clowns', according to the normal logic, no one will tie them together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this strange? I remember a lot of ways The sequence of potions, there is no necessary correlation between before and after." The black lady Luo Luota yawned and yawned, can see that her injury is so serious that the "destination of the goddess" is difficult to keep her strong energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Loro Tower, this is completely different. Even if other serial potions are lacking in relevance, we can find some commonalities from other aspects. But 'Divination' and 'Clown' can't, I can't understand it at all." Al. Hassan shook his head and exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened to their comments and smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, still There is something in common."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?" Ayr asked curiously, and Dunn’s movements in his arms also slowed down noticeably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein replied in a serious manner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whether it is 'divination' or 'clown' They can all be found at the circus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Ayr, Dunn, and Lorotta were there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...a good answer, I like young people like you!" The lady, Loro, was the first to return to God and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayre followed with a smile and shook his head and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this era, with self-deprecating spirit The gentleman is getting less and less. Fortunately, we met another one today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think I like to laugh at myself...I didn’t expect What do you have in common? Klein whispered a few words, and the smile answered bitterly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only hope that the potions of this sequence will not appear again." Names such as the animal trainer', 'Acrobatic actor', 'Magician', and so on, form the circus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is still a group...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha." Dunn and others were immediately teased by his words, and the carriage was filled with a cheerful atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage went all the way to Zouteland Street, and Klein, who had not been injured, entered the Blackthorn Security Company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Goddess! What happened to you? How could it be like this?" Roshan looked at him with a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked down at his dirty and broken dress, still feeling distressed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "There is always such an accident in the task, but fortunately, the goddess blesses, the ending is wonderful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let beautiful god!" Luo Shan Devoted to draw a "Red Moon" on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for Klein to speak, she volunteered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Need us to go to the third floor again Do you hide? Is that seal so dangerous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Trust me, it is more dangerous than you think." Klein replied with a lingering heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t have a more mysterious “transportation ceremony,” you will be told today at “2-049”! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goddess..." Rosanne’s lips are moving, there seems to be a lot of words to say, there are still many questions to ask, but considering the captain is waiting below She finally endured the urge to greet Mrs. Oliana and others to the third floor - the left and right of the Blackthorn Security Company, upstairs and downstairs, either belonging to the church industry or living in a devout, veteran cleric . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the partition, Dunn pushed the door of the entertainment room and said to the two nights who are playing the Kwant brand: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frye, Luo Yao, you immediately Go to the Tyrrell warehouse in the dock area and assist Leonard to handle the follow-up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." The woman with dark hair and a cold expression got the first to get up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black-eyed, pale-skinned "collector" Frye stood up straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They put down the Quinter card and walked out of the recreation room. When they passed the partition, they obviously stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait." Dunn shouted without letting everyone expect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else?" "The sleepless" Luo Yao asked and turned his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember to inform the police, let them block the road, don't let anyone close before you handle the scene, don't let anyone close." Dunn patted Under the forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Luo Yao turned and walked two steps forward and stopped again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head and blinked, confirming coldly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain Is there anything else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Dunn replied categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Yaowei invisible nod, took the lead to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperament of the cold and dark "collector" Frye still maintains an unhappy speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Dunn spoke again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, remember to tell Rosanne And Mrs. Oliana, they can come down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Frye calmly replied with almost no emotional fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch the two-nighter out of the gate and climb to the third floor, Klein quietly sighed, followed the captain and Ayr and others into the ground, all the way straight, arrived The opposite of the Chanis Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You go to the arsenal, look for the old Neil, we need his ritual magic treatment." Dunn gestured to stay behind the "sleeper" Cohen Li opened Chanis Gate, while commanding Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the effect of the drug fades, his spirit gradually fades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein didn't wait for the captain to add it. He said, "I will replace the old Neil guardian arsenal and will apply for at least two." Ten hunting bullets, and waiting for the approval of the church, resisting the curiosity of the Antignus family notes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Dunn I can't find a language to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, is there anything else?" asked Klein, who had finished the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn shook his head and still couldn’t speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removing the cane, turning the body, and taking a walk, Klein turned to the arsenal and told the old Neil who was drinking the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Become a runaway monster... Did you kill an extraordinary person?" Old Neil quickly cleaned up the table. "I am like listening." A play script."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He muttered around the table, aiming at the corridor, not waiting for Klein's answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein asked quite curiously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Neil, the church did not Is the real therapeutic agent? It still needs the help of ritual magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way..." Klein nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a former "keyboard adventurer", that is, game enthusiasts, it is a matter of habit to look forward to therapeutic agents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old Neil left, he sat down and felt the peace of a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this tranquility, he recalled the tragic situation of the swallowtail clown when he died, recalling his cold-blooded shooting, recalling the sly wounds and moorings. Gushing blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s body gradually trembled, his heart filled with discomfort, he stood up first, then sat down, then slowly repeated the process, and mixed up and down Walk around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call..." He vomited and planned to find something for himself, lest he always remembered the bad pictures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took off his top hat, took off his formal attire, took out his handkerchief and brush, and carefully cleaned up the dirt and dust on his clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, he heard the familiar old Neil footsteps - that was made by the heel first landing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really exhausting..." Old Neil complained about going into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You tell others that you don't come here for an hour, I need some rest." His eyes swept over Klein and he ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's better to go upstairs and rest, I guard here?" Klein kindly proposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neal shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was too noisy, Rosanne was a stop "The girl who can't stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All right." Klein didn't insist, put on his coat, put on his hat, picked up his cane, and returned to the corridor. And pull the door of the arsenal to half a cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, hey, hey, he walked slowly in the empty aisle, and suddenly saw a room next to him that he had never seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a door to the door..." Klein stopped near the corner and looked at the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that the "collector" Frye had returned and was inspecting it in detail for a completely stripped body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body? Klein's heart moved, and he took the courage to get close to the room and tapped three times on the open door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚,咚,咚. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flay stopped the action, turned his body, and looked at it with a blue and cold eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I’m disturbing you, I just want to know if this is the body of the extraordinary person?" Klein asked in a discreet tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Frye's thin lips were flat, but only spit out a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s eyes crossed him and looked at the body, and he found the familiar wound on his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the tuxedo clown... Klein whispered: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you find? "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Frye replied succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere is awkward, Klein is thinking about leaving, Frye has taken the initiative:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you feel unwell, you can come in and see, you will find that this is just a body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afraid I have psychological barriers? Klein nodded thoughtfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
