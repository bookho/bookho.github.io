			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Storm Church finally started to work in Banxi? Klein clenched his fists to his mouth and coughed twice. He asked very calmly at all: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alanland did not find an abnormal reaction from German Sparrow, took his eyes and looked around:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what happened specifically. I only know the high-level forces that may involve the storm church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And some time before, all go to work The Westport route has been cancelled, which may be the so-called sign. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-level power involved in the storm church? No, it should be the top-level power. I suspect that the Pope Church, the angel on the ground, has personally shot it. Even the "0" seal was used. After all, there may be a king of angels on the opposite side. The king of angels older than the Quaternary, and his descendants... Klein nodded and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the result? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not surprised at the fact that the Church of the Storm did not do anything to Banxi in the last few days, even if the "offenders" were known for their violent and reckless manners. In similar matters, there are still some procedures, for example, to make initial confirmations, such as evacuating innocent people, for example, blocking the surrounding waters, and this takes time.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan can't tell the true emotions of German Sparrow, sigh and laugh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For a long time, no There will be Banxi Port. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......It’s a storm church... Klein is secretly curious and curious about a more detailed process.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to know if the "Red Angel" Medici has appeared, is it really sleeping near the Banxi Port, has it been cleared by the Storm Church, he wants to know what the indigenous people in Banxi are doing, want to know intermittently What does it mean to talk about it, and want to know what secrets are hidden in the restaurant and the telegraph office.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, with the destruction of Banxi, he It’s hard to get the exact answer anymore.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be some internal information about the Storm Church, but Klein has no way of inquiring about the “downside down” level. I don’t have access to this type of confidentiality file at all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a high sequence of strong people who have cultivated the "inverted man" into a half-god and half-man. Maybe you know the answer to those questions... Klein sighed silently, his expression unchanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is really danger there..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s not falling, his throat is itching again, Severely coughed a few times.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is I sick? Elleno asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally thought that Gilman Sparo, like himself, was an extraordinary person with a marked increase in physical fitness. Before aging, it is impossible to get sick under normal circumstances, but now it seems that my own guess may be wrong.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein "Well", did not do Too much explanation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question of value and meaning... After a fierce battle with the "disease girl", it is strange to be sick... Daniz is next to Muttered two words in a contemptuous manner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerland laughed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can give You recommend a pharmacist that is more useful than going to a hospital or clinic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His extraordinary profession is this, his herbal shop is in the alley opposite the Red Theater, oh, famous for selling aphrodisiac, but this is not him. The area that is best at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does every pharmacist develop a similar pharmacy? Also, this is definitely one of the most profitable pharmacy businesses. If you have the ability, it is strange to not do it... Klein gently daggers and signals that he knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He came to Baiam in recent months. When was the last time you went to the 'generous city'?" Elland chuckled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you took your broken ship...Daniz replied silently in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back carefully and found that in recent months, except during this time, he was only at the beginning of the holiday, passing by Baiam once, and the rest of the time. Drifting at sea, pursuing treasures, or drinking and having fun in other ports in other places, is not enough to understand the subtle changes in the "generous city". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been in Baiyam for a few days, went to the Red Theater several times, but I have never heard of the pharmacist! This can only explain His aphrodisiac effect is limited!" Danicz's mouth is hard to beat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan laughed and didn’t argue with a big pirate, but turned to Galman Sparo:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it's just a normal illness, the pharmacist's offer is at a higher level.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, for you, expensive It doesn't matter, it's important to get back to health as soon as possible. Every adventurer is reluctant to be in a state of illness, because it means danger, meaning that being a hunting target at any time means an increase in the risk of losing control. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, maintaining good condition is a very important part of the extraordinary, but the price is also very important, if the pharmacist offers 1,000 pounds, I might as well go to the hospital to buy medicine, or describe in detail the path of illness, find Emma Wright, a sincere vampire to get a few potions! Although I have more than 6,000 pounds of deposits now, I still have several extraordinary features, but Also consider the future, I also want to add a magical item with a deadly attack, and also have to follow the clues of the high-sequence potion recipe... Klein sighed a few words in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recipe for high-ranking potions is not measured by money in the mysterious world, so Klein only wants to buy the corresponding clues.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When Elland leaves, Klein took the 700-pound bounty and divided Deniz 200.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears a hat, Put a cane, sometimes cough and go out with a snot, ready to take the carriage to the vicinity of the Red Theater.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz is very curious about the pharmacist's pharmacy, put two beards, put on the cap, and follow - after Klein's guidance, he already understands the use of scarves to lick face Yam is very eye-catching, accepting advice and buying fake beards.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the alley opposite the Red Theater, when Klein entered, he saw a man shrinking from a herbal shop without a sign. When he found someone, he immediately lowered his head and hurried away.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't worry, we won't guess what medicine you bought... Klein coughed twice again, stepping up and entering the dim herbal shop.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked away, and suddenly he was stunned, because the boss turned out to be an acquaintance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss was wearing a rural witch doctor Black robes, in their thirties, dark brown hair, very round face, chubby body, is the old man of Beckland "eye of wisdom" At the gathering of the gathering, the fat pharmacist who likes to satirize others, Klein once met with the other party in a circus and recognized him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He no longer appears in the extraordinary party of the "eye of wisdom", because he left Beckland... Klein coughed and went up two steps:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me some medicine. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat pharmacist has a owl that is round and bulging on his shoulders. One person and one animal are looking up at the same time and looking at Klein.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief observation, the fat pharmacist showed a sly smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friends, the weather is so cold, don't do it outside Things are going, though that is really exciting. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this with?... Klein first stunned and immediately understood why the other party said this.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
