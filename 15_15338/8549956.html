			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anana with a pair of beautiful eyes hesitated for a dozen seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can choose You think that the most effective one, you are a diviner, and I am not, of course, except for cards, including Tarot, I have tried to study them at home, always feel that this is more like a toy, more like a game." Bryan<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought a little, his elbows were on the edge of the table, his palms were placed in the mouth and nose, his eyes were calm, his voice said quietly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then use the chart to divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the pen on the table and a pen Stacked white paper: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Write down the name of your fiancé, as well as the appearance, residence address, date of birth, if you can remember the specific time, then It’s even better.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of wearing, dressing and temperament, he believes that the other person is not illiterate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna did not answer, reached out and took out a piece of white paper, picked up the pen, dipped a little ink, brushed and wrote, and then paused thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two minutes passed, she pushed the white paper to the opposite side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein explores and presses, and turns the order to include the information on the paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Joyce Meyer, 2 pm, September 15, 1323, 8 Stephens Street, East End, Tingen City, short blonde hair, eagle-like nose..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a glance at this, Klein quickly calculated the other's birthday number:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1 plus 5 equals 6". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mysterious field of spiritual mathematics, the number of digits added to the birthday date is called the birthday number, affecting a person’s life before the age of 27, and the birth month The number of spirits (the number of birth months added to a single digit) affects 27 to 54 years old, and the number of births (the number of birth years added to each other) affects 54 years of age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is July 1349, Joyce is not yet 27 years old, so Klein directly calculated the number of birthdays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the number 6 indicates that life is balanced, coordinated, and has a love, a relatively good marriage, or a quasi-marriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he counted the other's number of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called number of years of age is to replace the year of birth with the year of the year, and then add the number of birthdays and the number of births to get the approximate fortune of the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1+3+4+9=17,1+7=8;8+ 生月灵数9+生日灵灵6=23;2+ 3=5; the number of the current year is 5, indicating that there will be changes and accidents, and it takes a certain risk..." Klein made a judgment in silence based on the actual situation, and determined that the information provided by Anna was more accurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took his eyes off the paper and looked at Anna Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Meyer is "Starting on June 3rd?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he didn't lie, that's it." Anna bit her lip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein took the pen and remembered it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Anna with a dark brown eyelid and said softly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to start Draw the corresponding chart, it takes a certain amount of time and absolute silence, can you go out and wait for a while? Angelica will give you a cup of coffee or black tea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Okay." Anna knew that some of the diviners would be quirky, didn't accidentally get up, took the gauze hat with the pink-blue ribbon, and left the citrine room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein locked the door and returned to the table, drawing the event chart according to the date, time, and time, including constellations, planets, and Elements such as the house position (the division of the sky position). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, he almost did not turn the "Astrology Handbook", and it was all done by memory.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In this occultal course of this time, Klein It is found that as long as it is related to divination, once you learn it, you can easily master it and quickly become instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the "Divination"... He painted the astrolabe, and he gave birth to a sense of satisfaction, only to feel that the body, mind, and spirit are relaxed. less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the results, according to the constellation, according to the house where the planet fell, according to other auxiliary symbols, roughly judge Joyce Mayer will encounter difficulties, But eventually I can come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, divination is actually completed, but Klein attaches great importance to the first single "business", hoping to accumulate word of mouth, to facilitate the subsequent play, so Pick up the pen and drop a line of Hermes on the piece of paper that Anna wrote:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joyce Meyer's current situation."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He meditated on this sentence, remembering the information on the date of birth on paper, over and over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven times, Klein grabbed the piece of paper and leaned back against the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He outlined the ball of light in his mind, and his eyes turned dark, and the whole person quickly entered the state of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding area suddenly became ethereal, and there seemed to be invisible things and illusory fog on the top, boundless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein recalled all the content on the paper, then indulged himself and fell asleep in this state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to use the "dream divination"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat the question, keep in mind, and then let your own star spirits roam the spirit world and gain inspiration in your dreams! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ordinary people, there are occasionally similar experiences, but the "symbol" in the dream is complicated and difficult to remember, and the "Divination" is There is no such problem, and some pictures can be visually seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything starts to blur, Klein is half awake and half awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a distorted, illusory world, he saw a blond young man with a hooked nose, who was swimming in fear in a bloody sea, almost several times Was swallowed, but eventually fortunately fled to the shore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture was broken and converted. Klein saw a gray-blue house with a toy windmill at the door. The blond young man with a hooked nose was slowly entering. I am happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the picture turned again, and Klein found himself in a palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls are collapsed and ruined, and some places are even covered with moss and weeds. Through the holes around you can see the outer peaks and almost close The white clouds here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the palace, there is a huge seat carved into a stone, it is inlaid with faint gems and gold, it seems not for humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This huge seat is empty and mottled, as if it has been baptized for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wondered and wondered why he dreamed of such a scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His cockroaches began to decrease, and the subconscious went outside the palace to find out where it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he felt the gaze of his eyes, from behind his eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned sharply and looked at the huge stone seat, only to see that there were countless transparent locusts huddled together, slowly creeping, comfortable Growing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his eyes and woke up from his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crystal ball, tarot card, paper drawing the astrolabe into his voice, the reality quickly defeated the illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dream of the beginning is the result of divination. What is the latter? It seems to be against me?" Klein put down the paper, rubbed his temples and frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he can confirm is that this is not the hidden fear in the heart expressed through the dream, because it is doing divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The non-human palace on a mountain...the silent look at me...the twisted and weird worm image..." Klein recalled before, silently guessing "The one who is the 'transportation ceremony' communication, or the Antignus family notes... Yes, that note mentioned the night country of the Hornachs! Just in the dream The palace is on the mountain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slightly interpreted and thanked himself for choosing the "Divination". According to the old Neil, "The voyeur "You can also do "dream divination," but certainly not as good as yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, the ghost is not scattered... I can only hope to catch Riel Bieber earlier... Klein converges on emotions and takes paper with an astrolabe , slowly walked to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the door and went to the reception hall, and saw Anna staring out the window, completely ignoring the black tea in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, Mr. Moretti, have you divined the results?" The corner of the eye swept over Klein, and Anna hurriedly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not answer directly, but asked according to the revelation picture obtained in the dream:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is there a toy windmill in your home, or at the door of Mr. Meyer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna’s eyes are steep and wide, and for a long time, they are speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, she muttered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was the gift he sent me. Just at the door of my house, you, how do you know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, this, can this be divination? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiles and speaks softly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, Miss Anna, Joey Mr. Mayer is at your home. If you rush back immediately, you should still meet him. He experienced a disaster, an unimaginable painful journey. What he needs is not asking, but comfort, but warmth. "Husband."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, really?" Anna asked in disbelief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diviner she knows never says such certain words and gives such certain conclusions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know when you go home immediately." Kline smiled softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, steam master, is this true? My poor Joyce is back? Are you sure? No, I can't believe it. ......" Anna snorted, almost incoherently said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took out a 1 Sule banknote from the bag, and waited for Klein to change to zero, she left the Divination Club in a small step. Hastily rushed home in a carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does this include a tip?" Kline took the banknote and shook his head and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-wheeled carriage drove across the street and entered the Eastern District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna was stunned and looking forward and looking at the street outside the window and fluttering quickly. Not long after, the toy windmill jumped into her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the carriage, she did not care about her own manner, almost rushed to the door and rang the doorbell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slammed open, Anna saw a blond young man in a black formal suit, his face was stunned, his eyes were happy, and he had a eagle-like nose. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought I would miss you today." Joyce said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the steam is on, you are really back!" Anna licked her eyes and shouted in surprise and joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
