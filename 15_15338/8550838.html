			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Family live in Halls Street 19?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When remembering data, Klein is keen Grasped a message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Welch’s residence in the Howles neighborhood, the Divination Club in the Howles neighborhood, the fabric called Sirius Aripis The merchant is also in the Halls block... It seems that Welch knows that Heinz Vansente is not a strange thing, even he knows through Sirius Aripis..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, Klein felt that the clues were connected and the thoughts became smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a question about why Welch knew Henas. Vincent, because the banker’s son was not a hobbyist. For him, money is more useful than divination. Now, Klein feels that he can initially infer the process of getting acquainted with each other:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" According to various magazine descriptions The middle class and the wealthy are happy to visit neighbors at the same level to form a social circle that will help them. Welch and the cloth merchant Sirius, who are also in the Halls neighborhood, are fully motivated to have the opportunity to be friends..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sirius knows that Heinz Vansente, who often goes to the Diels Club Diocese Club, is not particularly difficult to understand, maybe an encounter, maybe a Help, you can familiarize people who have been in the same area for a long time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hainas Vansente wants to sell the ancient books in his hand, so Through the introduction of Sirius, I found the history department student Welch..."< Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The image of the suspected evil god 'real creator' appeared in the Henas dream, and he also holds the correct spell format, which shows that he is in the field of occult Going deeper, does not rule out the possibility of being a member of a hidden organization..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is not excluded that he joins the secret organization is guided by Sirius. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the surging of ideas, Klein did not use divination means, It is almost certain that the information left by the other party has a lot of credibility:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if it is not called Sirius Aripis, not a cloth merchant, can’t live On the 19th, he must also belong to the Howth district, or the nearby area!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about re-examining the other party's borrowing record:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last time I went to the Devils Library was last Saturday, the day before Selena’s birthday dinner, that is, Henas Vansente died One day, until now, several days have passed, he still has not returned the journals that he borrowed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the previous record, only two journals were borrowed. In the case, he will usually come again the next day. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does this mean that Sirius knows the death of Heines, is frightened, and dare not come to the Devils Library again?" "Well, he first borrowed a lot of unrelated historical books and periodicals, and later gradually became clear about the goals, and the large-scale coincidence with those I borrowed... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This shows that he has no mentoring, no senior associate professor of the Department of History, and he relies on his own groping. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What will happen if the target is frightened? Two choices, one, when the information is basically complete, he will go straight to the main peak of the Hornachs Mountains. Second, when the main conditions are still lacking, he will hide first, look at the limelight, and confirm the death of Henas. After not being involved with it, it will appear again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of it, Klein folded the borrowing record, pushed it back to several librarians, and took out portraits asking if they had seen the goal." Unfortunately, there are a lot of borrowers coming here every day, and administrators are hard to have an impression on people who have no obvious features.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, trouble you guys It is. Klein took away the documents and badges.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police officer, is there anything else?" An administrator sighed and asked earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, if there are new clues, I will Come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held the black and silver cane in his left hand and walked quickly to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he saw a man wearing a black double-breasted dress and letting the collar stand tall and head down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the two sides passed by, Kline sighted at the other side's thick and messy eyebrows, aiming at a pair of gray-blue eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the parts that the tall collar can't cover! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siris? Sirius Aripis? So clever? Klein stunned and didn't expect to meet the target directly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this luck! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too much fun? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He measured himself and felt the soreness of the muscles, so nothing happened and he continued to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you have to follow the wishes of your heart and be steady! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as Sirius has not left Tingen, this miss is irrelevant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the man in a black double-breasted dress walked to the front desk and handed the journal in his hand to one of the administrators. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Return." He lowered his voice and said vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The librarian took the journal at random and glanced at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously looked up to the opposite side, and the body began to tremble uncontrollably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a problem?" asked the man who cocked the collar high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sentence is like the Mars that ignited the dynamite barrel, let the administrator get out of control instantly, running sideways, shouting loudly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The criminal is here!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... At this moment, there is only one sentence in the heart of Klein who has not had time to go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He instinctively put his right hand under his arm and took out the revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the man first glimpsed, then turned and ran away,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he did not rush to the door, but fled to the side of the convex window, it seems to break the glass and jump outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein, who was flustered, turned to see this scene, and his heart suddenly settled down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he found that although he was afraid of the goal, the goal was even more afraid of himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In such a hasty encounter, the other party is certainly unable to judge my strength, and I don’t know what I am good at, so he will be consciously avoiding Open the frontal conflict and seek other ways to escape!" In the heart, Klein raised the revolver and slammed the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the man in a black double-breasted dress slammed and tried to avoid bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, with his right hand, the whole person vacated and rushed to the glass of the convex window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! Klein’s first shot was an empty bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver hunter bullet penetrates the air and steadily plunges into the back of Sirius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! The glass broke, and Sirius ran out, leaving a drop of red blood and a piece of crystal on the window sill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the other person's injury, Klein is no longer timid, he ran over, with a chair, jumped onto the window sill and leaped outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a green lawn on the first floor of the Deville Library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a shot of Sirius running towards the side, trying to enter the alleys between the two buildings, Klein had not yet practiced running The hit rate, do not dare to shoot blindly, can only hold a stick, hold the gun in one hand, and follow the back of the black dress to catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's blood drops along the ground, trying to shorten the distance between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the corner is in sight, seeing the injured Sirius slower and slower, Klein, who is about to seize the opportunity, suddenly has a heartbeat, only the front It seems that it is not a human being, but a wolf, a tiger, with terrible danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his instinct for being a diviner, this is the warning of his spirituality! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately slowed down, and the corners of his eyes swept the blood on the ground:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and initially In contrast, the blood that Sirius is now dripping has turned black! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a gust of wind blew, Klein’s eyes reflected the face of Sirius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a thick, messy eyebrow, it’s a gray-blue eyelid, it’s a raised sarcoma, it’s cracked. The corner of the mouth, that is the teeth of Bai Sensen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sirius turned out to be counterattack at this moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Klein's face more and more clear, so that he seems to smell a stench! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Sirius saved a distance of seven or eight meters, significantly exceeding the scope of normal people, but because Klein stopped chasing in time, the two sides were separated by nearly ten meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a distance of two meters, the mouth of the sticky saliva and the dense sarcoma of the nausea to the extreme constitute a clear and horrifying picture, let Klein's The spirit is highly tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t even think about it, he slammed the opponent’s short-lived stiffness, raised his right hand, and slammed the bullets, causing the bullets to pour toward the head of the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! Pong! Pong! Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very close shot made one after another silver hunting demon bullets into the head of Sirius, hitting each other's blood splashes, the face is blurred, hit The other side is stagnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one breath, the bullets in the revolver, Klein subconsciously want to back, confirm the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, Sirius, who was trying to stand up straight, gave him a great start, and let him suddenly sway the cane held by his left palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! The hard black silver cane draws the neck of Sirius and draws a deep red mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein instinctively smacked each other until Sirius wobbled to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call! call! call! Klein slammed his hand with his cane, gasping for a gasp, staring at the target, fearing that the other party suddenly swindled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Sirius’s head was almost a broken ripe watermelon, and the remaining dense sarcoma began to subside, and the body returned to calm after a few convulsions. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
