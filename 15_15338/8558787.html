			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ollavi Medical Care Foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman in charge of the volunteer registration staggered and groped for the pen that fell to the ground. At this time, Klein also noticed that she had just watched it for a few days. The former "News" had the period of his own portraits and deeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will also subscribe to newspapers in the Rothde Islands? Calculating the time when the ship came over, I really could only watch the old news three or four days ago... I knew this, I would re-squeeze my face and think of a pseudonym and come over again... Klein stood at the desk and thought helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 30-year-old woman finally picked up her pen and raised her face, shaking and screaming:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, do you want to volunteer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Klein gave a positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but you are an adventurer." The woman who was scared was stumped and found a reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She instinctively does not want to make this extremely dangerous guy a volunteer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becoming famous is not necessarily a good thing... forget it, I will change my face and change my clothes and change my name again... Klein’s heart is giving up, but the surface is Nothing emotionally asks: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is the ruler who can't do volunteers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsible Registering a woman's face that is about to cry, blurt out and debut:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The volunteer registration room suddenly became very quiet. Klein first glimpsed and immediately wanted to laugh, and finally managed to maintain the image of German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady was slightly calm and noticed that her answer had obvious problems, forcing a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I mean no one is stipulated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just that I’m impressed that adventurers are busy, need to go out to sea, and have very little time Do volunteer work. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's them." Klein responded succinctly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady stretched out her mouth and smiled again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, I will register for you right away. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said that she took out a form and handed it over:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You fill out, We will provide training and volunteer positions according to your requirements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will contact you on your own initiative, or you can come and ask for yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is already I made up my mind not to put the form filled out by German Sparrow into the file, but hand it over to the head of the foundation and hand it over to the police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goddess, how can such a dangerous guy run to volunteer? She quietly painted a red moon on her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded silently, took the form, sat down, picked up the pen, and brushed up the basics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, a man with a white robe of doctors came in and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Huanna, do you have new volunteers? We have to start training in the morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hua Anna, who is responsible for registration, has the heart to shake her head and can sit opposite her. Even if she didn't speak and didn't raise her head, Herman Sparrow gave her a strong sense of urgency, so she didn't dare to lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." She responded first to the man in white coat and then looked at Klein. "Mr. Sparo, you are going now. Accept basic training for volunteers, or wait for tomorrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intends to be familiar with it, and then volunteers to change his identity to be professional, so that he can quickly enter the hospital to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huanna obviously took a breath:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After you fill out the form, follow Mr. Graa used to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Klein calmly responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half an hour, calm and polite adventurer, Greman Spalo, looked at the unusually dirty toilet in front of him, holding his breath: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brush it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, you have just accepted simple patient training, but This is not the most common thing we do in the hospital. We are mainly responsible for cleaning up the patient's vomit, changing the items on the bed, and keeping the bathroom clean and hygienic. Oh, the wounding and the like are professionals. We only need to have Initial mastery.” Graa squeezed her nose and pointed at the toilets covered with yellow and black stains. “There have been volunteers just demonstrated, let's get started.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is different from what I imagined...not the same... Klein’s first reaction was to turn away, but in the end, he still picked up the cleaning tool with a blank expression, enduring strong disgust and getting close to the past. It’s down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he stretched his right hand slightly back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, Klein took off his white coat and put on his top hat, leaving the Olavy Medical Ambulance Foundation indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was strongly shaken after he was going to volunteer to find a chance to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the sweet lemon bar by horse-drawn carriage, and he made up his mind to continue to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must become a 'Master of Secrets' in 1350, and digest this potion and begin to seek clues to high sequences." Klein re-emphasized in his heart Got the goal again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He converges, enters the sweet lemon bar, spends 8 pence at the bar for a pork chop with apple cider and a piece of bread with butter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These together with a rye beer worth 1.5 pence constitutes Klein’s lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t hesitate to finish eating, took out his handkerchief and wiped his mouth, and said to the bartender:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What about your boss? I have something to look for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have verbally agreed to join the "Adventurer Mutual Aid Society", Klein will naturally let go. Taking advantage of this loose alliance, I am ready to ask Bilt Brando to contact the wild or willing to be a private “artisan” to create something like the Aziz copper whistle, so that every time the summoning messenger has to arrange a ceremony, mourn The mantra is complicated and troublesome and delays time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if Bilt Brando does not know "artisans", Klein will not force, after all, joining the "Adventurer Mutual Aid" does not need to pay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender refers to the stairway:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is on the second floor.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have promised to join his league and have seen those bodyguards, they will let you go." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded invisibly, slowly got up and walked up the stairs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, No guards blocked him until he went to the second floor, and a bodyguard came over to ask.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the success of German Sparrow, he went well I saw Bilt Brando again and found that there was a strange man beside him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My friend, Sotos Young, Mutual Aid Important member. Bilt pointed to the man wearing a dark red headscarf.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply greeted, Klein found a chair and sat down very directly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope to get help from the 'artisan', don't know if the mutual aid can Provide clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Artisan?" Bilt took a cigar and paused for a few seconds, saying, "I do know a 'artisan', but He does not want to meet unfamiliar people, which will bring him great danger. If you have any needs, I can help you to transfer. I think I should have this reputation."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the major churches, sometimes, the medium and low sequence extraordinary people who do not subjectively malicious can be ignored, but the "artisan" must be treated without discrimination, otherwise it will cause the proliferation of magical items to humans. The society brings great instability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Bilt’s “Adventurist Mutual Aid” is not simply a waste of money. At least it has gathered a lot of resources and channels... Klein has already prepared for it. Good fisherman shouts:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to make it into a ring that mainly provides underwater activity."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t talk about the messenger for the time being, he’s going to try the ability of the “artisan” and the credibility of the group. The curse of the summoning messenger will cause a lot of unnecessary if it spreads too much. Trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary features of Sequence 9 are not expensive, even if Bilt is greedy, it doesn’t matter if you make a magical item. Anyway, I still have a bunch of Poseidon. The spell of the field...and I can't go to the door to collect debts. It's better. He can organize the "Adventurer Mutual Aid Society". There must be a lot of money and materials... Klein thought about it and couldn't help but look at it. Bilt looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, Bilt Momo chilled, and the hair behind his neck was all up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only feels that Gelman Sparrow’s eyes are just like watching a treasure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as a treasure, this is not a good experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilte looked at Sotos next to his eyes and squeezed a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is it a fishman?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This level of material makes magical items basically no surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The craftsman fee is £150, and you can give it to me after the event is completed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very fair The price... Klein nodded silently and threw the fish in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he waited for Bilt, he added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me ask that person again 'Artisan', ask him if he has the ability to cure the ritual of summoning spiritual creatures on an item, and the requirement is to use at least one year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question." Bilt sighed and gave Sotos a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sotos licked the eye socket of the depression, stepping forward:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ger Mr. Man, have you been interested in going out to sea recently?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We already have a few good boats and we are going to call people to go hunting pirates in the east. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's very interesting...but my recent focus is on digesting the potion... Klein calmly shook his head.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on Sotos’s face stiffened and disappeared immediately.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t say anything because it was a pirate general The refusal of the adventurer - he and Bilt have collected the corresponding newspaper and confirmed the true and false of the German Sparrow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slowly got up Put the top hat on the chest and whisper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your help. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
