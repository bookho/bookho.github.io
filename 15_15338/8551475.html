			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are actually three pages, but those words are too complicated and too difficult to remember. My current limit is a little more than two pages...more will be confusing...other I can only wait for the next time... Audrey silently added a few words in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Russell Diary? Klein’s spirit rose and he smiled and asked with an answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Miss Justice, what do you need?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey's eyes are bright, but they pretend to answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, I am about to digest 'People' potion, I hope to get the formula of 'Reader' potion earlier, so that the materials can be prepared in advance, oh, I know that the contents of these two pages are not much, and may not match the 'Readers' formula. The value, I will give another page, um, I will pay you another extra money..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is not falling, suddenly she feels wrong, I couldn't help but lick myself in my heart: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Fool is at least a big man close to the gods, how can you see vulgar money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Audrey failed to maintain the "audience" status, and stumbled and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't mean that! Mr. Fool, I mean, you can specify the compensation you want, yes, that's it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like it Your previous proposal... I will answer this question: When you really digest the "audience" potion, you will get the follow-up recipe. I have a man, no, I have to use a more pressing '眷者', I am busy. Something, just need a certain amount of money, this is his unregistered account, the unregistered account at Beckland Bank... Well, this week I will disguise myself to the Bakerland Bank Tingen branch for an anonymous name. Account... Klein didn't answer immediately, and seemed to be serious and serious about his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland Bank is one of the seven largest banks in the Kingdom of Lun and holds the right to liquidate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The Kingdom of Lun handles the transfer business between banks in the same city by means of centralized bill clearing, but unlike the counterparts in the Intis Republic, here Not all banks can join the ranks. The seven largest banks hold this right firmly, so they are called clearing banks, so that other banks can only rely on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the account opening in different places can only be completed in the same bank through the clearing of different branches. After the steam train and cable telegraph, the efficiency is improved. A lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, "Sun" Dairik Berger suddenly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'Reader' potion formula? Behind the 'spiritual analyst' of the 'spiritual analyst'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey looked at him doubtfully : "Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Miss "Justice" had problems with the instincts of the audience:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party uses the ancient name "psychologist" of the corresponding sequence 7, rather than the more modern "psychologist"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s weird, this guy... Audrey once again examines the “sun” every move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derico didn’t feel that he had shown an unusual side and seriously replied: “I can help you get this formula!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he felt guilty because he couldn’t get it for a while, forcibly explained:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the sequence of the dragon family, and our silver city was under the rule of the giant Wang Ting, you know, the giant and the dragon are deadly enemies, so this sequence of 9, 8 and 7, the city of silver has, I have "Get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This child... I have been yelling at him before, don’t talk, don’t reveal his origins, and the result... Klein almost wants to reach out Live your face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he can easily prevent the "sun" from revealing these things - as long as he does not help "simultaneous translation", "justice" and "downside down" are also heard, because they simply do not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Klein turned to think, thinking that this can effectively consolidate his powerful and mysterious image in the hearts of the three members, so he laughed and listened, did not speak, did not do Extra try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant Wang Ting, the dragon family, the city of silver... Audrey heard a confusing first, first looked at the opposite side of the "hanging man", from The body movements judged that the gentleman was equally shocked and confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was busy looking up at the top of the bronze long table, only to see the "fool" sitting on the high back chair, covered in a thick gray mist The right elbow is in the position of the armrest, so that the palm rests leisurely against the head of the micro side. It is not surprising, not surprising, no thinking, no doubt, only looking at it with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows...he knows...Audrey and Alger made a positive judgment almost at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The City of Silver, I have never heard of this place... Where is it?" Audrey tempted and asked, "Panging people" Jay is focused on listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment the "sun" Dairiker Berg is also full of doubts, he can see that in addition to "fool" this may be the gods Existence, "justice" and "downside down" are obviously closer to the extraordinary, a certain sequence of extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the place abandoned by God, in addition to the people of the Silver City, Deric has never seen other living people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not a citizen of the Silver City, which is City-state?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哎...Klein couldn’t help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey’s lips were swaying, and I didn’t know what to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, what he hides is that if you don’t want to answer similar questions, don’t just inquire about the city where others are... Elegantly closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, "The hangman" Alger also misunderstood the purpose of the "Sun". He did not know that the other party was really and simply asking questions, so he kept it. Silence, don't say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derrick, who has never been answered, seems to understand what he is, no longer mentioning this matter, instead saying:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will get the recipe for the 'Reader' potion as soon as possible, I want to use it to exchange the initial sequence of the 'Sun' route."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"'Sun' route? Sequence 9 'singer'?" "Inverted man" Alger immediately asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be this, but I There is a lack of understanding of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein on the sidelines of everything decided to come out because he didn't want to risk being taken away by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think 'Justice' should have no 'singer' The formula."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the "upside down" Mr. has a high probability of getting it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing Audrey nodding, he chuckles again: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I give the 'Sun' a 'singer' formula, 'the sun' will read as soon as possible The heart of the 'potion recipe' to the 'justice' Miss, fight for two meetings, and the 'justice' Miss gave me the newly obtained Russell Diary, thus completing the transaction."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, from the principle of equivalence exchange, 'the sun' has suffered, but he is only promised that he will really come up with the 'reader' formula, 'justice' Miss, think about how to compensate him, or, let me compensate him, Miss 'Justice' provides money to give me a leader, he needs to do something recently, huh, this is because 'the sun' may not be able to receive 'justice' Miss Gold material or compensation "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
