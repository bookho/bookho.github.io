			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detective? Peer... However, he can help the police department to deal with such a serious case, indicating that it is a real well-known big detective, at least in the West Vilas field is very famous ... amount, serial killings involve demon worship, not should Was it handed over to the value of the night, the punitive or the mechanical heart? The police department will do some assistants. Why do you have to ask private detectives to help yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the 11 consecutive killings must have caused a sensation, and West Vilas is under a lot of pressure, not willing to wait like that? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein flashed a lot of thoughts and smiled on the surface:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He boarded the carriage hired by Essinger Stanton and saw a sturdy young brown man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my assistant." Essinger, who is thin and angular, said, "Please sit down."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not close the door of the carriage, nor did he let the driver drive the horse forward to show that he was not malicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein deliberately sat down and asked a little uneasily:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Stanton What do you want to talk to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger took out a dark pipe: "I want to know that you are tracking the harvest of Ms. Lopez. What did you hear or discover?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...I am also a detective, you should know that we have a confidentiality agreement." Klein As difficult to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am asking you on behalf of West Vilas, this has nothing to do with confidentiality." Essinger rubbed his pipe with his thumb, "1 pound, Hmm... How about 2 pounds?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the lessons of the previous Mersoe incident, plus the need for no secrets, Klein did not hesitate Answer: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Essinger smiles from the pocket I took out two 1 pound notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein made memories and said calmly: "We only heard a word, Ms. Lopez tried to send a subordinate to tell Kapin, let him recently Don't send someone over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kaping?" Essinger nodded slightly. "I know."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know Kapyeong?" Klein didn't hide his guilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger handed the banknotes over and said with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is A controversial tycoon in Jowood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Beckland, there are often naive girls missing in secluded streets, and very After a long period of time, they may be accidentally found in various or legal or illegal brothels. A large number of rumors point to Kapyeong, who thinks he is a dirty criminal head, but because there is not enough evidence, he still Still free, and met a lot of big people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is true, this guy will die 10,000 times... Klein nodded and sighed: < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is Lun, this is Beckland, Mr. Stanton, I should say goodbye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Thank you for your cooperation." Essinger politely half-lifted and sent, "Yes, your fighting level is quite good, maybe we will have cooperation opportunities in the future. How can I call you "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"?. Moriarty Sherlock "Klein simple answer, alight from the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he boarded the newly arrived railroad public carriage, Essinger Stanton let the assistant close the door and told the driver to go to the Hillston area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking out the window, the two-and-white middle-aged gentleman put a dark pipe and took out a brass ornament from his pocket. Slowly rubbing in your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brass jewelry is a pocket-sized book with a vertical eye in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Mr. Moriarty’s appearance and dress were a bit uncoordinated. He wore a very sleek Phnom Penh glasses, but deliberately kept his beard around his mouth. It seems vulgar and barbaric, which is not in line with normal thoughts. Nowadays, people who are willing to wear gold-rimmed glasses often care about their own image, have a knowledge and temperament image, and perhaps, he is deliberately concealing what... Of course, maybe he is a gentleman who is different from ordinary people..." Essinger seems to be talking to himself, as if he is teaching assistants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Klein on the public carriage leaned against the wall and silently said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The Detective Essinger Stanton has a problem. From the moment I open my mind, he has always maintained the blue and indifference of rational thinking. The spirituality dominates the purple position, and few other emotional colors emerge. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For normal people, unless you study the problem intently, it is difficult to maintain a similar state for too long, there must be other emotional colors. Appears, the difference is the question of how long to stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... or Essinger Stanton detective is such a wizard who is observing and reasoning at the moment, talent The strange guy, or, he, is the extraordinary?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper and lower floors, carrying a public carriage with more than 40 passengers to Baker In the Rand Bridge area, Klein gradually retracted his thoughts and turned his eyes to the window, admiring the two across the street. All kinds of building layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally he can see five- to six-storey brown houses, which demonstrates Beckland’s latest trends and state-of-the-art architectural techniques. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the transfer, Klein arrived at Iron Gate Street and walked down the carriage opposite the Brave Bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he hasn’t been to the bar at the busiest time, he just saw him and saw Casper, who was sitting at the bar and drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man of the rosacea had a cup of violent scent, tasted the aroma of malt and irritated the throat, and sat up with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned over and knocked at the bar, smiling and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maric in "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he single-handedly put a pocket, holding the Azick copper whistle, and shielding its negative effects with spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his voice did not fall, but suddenly felt his eyes swept over himself, full of scrutiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished asking, the line of sight moved again and seemed to look at Casper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man with a huge scar on his face saw Klein, and he said with no anger:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "He didn't come, didn't come yesterday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Didn't come... Kleinton sighed and no longer wrapped the Azick copper whistle with spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I mentioned Maric, someone was watching me... I heard that I was asking about the whereabouts of Maric, and that gaze shifted again... This is someone looking for Maric... Klein resisted the urge to look back and analyzed the previous anomaly in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combining with one of his original doubts, he felt that the problem seemed to have a rough answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very confused last week, there should be a sequence of 5 levels of bodyguards, why do I have to take 1,000 pounds for 3 days of protection tasks, this is not to say that the price is too low, and It is a level that can already be regarded as a strong person. In the goddess church, it is enough to be the deacon of the night or the bishop of the parish. If you can still get the favor of the “holy object”, you can even compete for the seat of the archbishop and senior deacon...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In each of the secret organizations and intelligence agencies, sequence 5 also means the identity of the head of the large area or the characters of the second and third places in the area, even if it is a wild, unorganized person, this is Strong people are also able to build their own small organization...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter from which point of view, the bodyguards can enjoy their dedication, there is no need to personally pick up Single "...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
