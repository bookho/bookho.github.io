			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part wrote about 850,000 words, which is a super long article in the architecture. I think it seems that there are only the third and fourth volumes of the world. Thinking every day, writing every day, although very happy, but really tired, especially after the addition of fitness this month, almost no time to read the novel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of this department is "no face", it is expected that there are three meanings, note, note, the following is the standard answer to reading comprehension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to promote to "no face", this is the easiest and easiest to think of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is to represent the survival status of Xiaoke in Beckland, with fake face, fake name, fake identity, and people to know, handle things, volume Into the storm, but back home, but still lonely, deserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third refers to those who have been crushed into powder in the big age, or rushed in. In the history books, they have no name, no appearance, no In the past, there was no life. It only existed in simple numbers or descriptions. In a sense, isn’t this a “faceless person”? The simplest dragons, the most unobtrusive cannon fodder, who cares what their faces look like? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the phrase "year-old hunger, people eat", the simple six words contain a lot of sadness, pain, cruelty, blood and despair, How many living people who have no face and no name are concentrated? Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I tried to give some descriptions of the old Kohler, Liv, Frya in the waves of the times, trying to restore these "faceless people" hopes, Difficulties and tragedies make them look like people rather than numbers. Although this second part of the fragmentation is a big reason, it is the hidden main line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they passed away, more people like them poured in, "No Face" always existed, they are the stepping stones of the times, but also the times The developer is a real and indispensable role in the whole story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, I have abandoned the more sorrowful and shocking finish. After all, this is called the no-face, the worst era of the worst era is reversed. After the echoes, I can express what I want very well and powerfully. The times advance, ruthless helplessness, but there are countless faceless people lying under the feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the third part will not have so much symbolic meaning, because the main line is very clear and direct, the amount of the third part is, "Traveller ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang Wensheng, everyone should be able to imagine something, but we will still focus on the second part, there are still many lines in Bay City, such as mercury Snake-related, such as underground evil spirits, such as the real plot of the royal family, such as 0-17, such as vampire-related, such as the psychological alchemy association, which is because of the need to give the city of Audrey, Fols, Hugh, Em Lin, they show their chances, because Bay City is the most important stage of the whole novel. Xiaoke will definitely come back and will definitely stay for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part said that it was scattered. In fact, after a lot of things were finally strung together, it was okay for me. It was not bad for me, but it was not bad. The real problem is actually another point, that is, the rhythm of the story has been relatively tight, not loose, in other words, constantly encountering events, constantly solving problems, lacking enough long enough in the middle to relax, read it will Some fatigue and irritability, although this has the cause of the aggregation effect of extraordinary characteristics, it does have some problems from the setting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that the Tarot will be held once a week, so the timeline is cut into a week-by-week state, it is easy to have a repeating sense of dullness, and must also be maintained There are certain things every week, so the rhythm of extraordinary events will be a little tight. The solution I am considering now is to skip some of the less important Tarot gatherings and be more free in time control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the Tarot Club itself is also the main body, certainly not less, like the first time after Emlin joined, I have not forgotten, there are many friends All kinds of things, such as the reaction of the church, such as another copper whistle, I remember, but deliberately pressed not to write, ready to stay at the beginning of the third. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because you don’t want to make the details of the overall picture and emotions of the last two ends dilute or destroy, so you can only do certain techniques. deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part is finished, I am very happy to erect a role, so that everyone still likes it, it is not impossible to use 0-17 to end the violence. On the one hand, it is still very arrogant to write out the church. It can be as long as the ruling class. There is no reason. On the other hand, this is not a finishing touch. It is just a continuation. One is to follow up and point to the follow-up. Not to mention, so as not to be spoiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
