			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Male voice? Mr. "Inverted man", is it still a small "sun"? Klein looked at the gloomy sky outside the window, got up and entered the bathroom next door, locked the door of the house, and took four steps back to the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mysterious space, the ancient palace stands quietly, and the imaginary male sounds are layered and reverberating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at it and confirmed that he prayed for a small "sun." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat in the position of the "fool" and extended his right hand to spread spirituality and touch the corresponding deep red star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, praying for clarity is clear enough, and the hierarchy is clear, Klein quickly figured out what the "sun" is telling:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time he saw Amon’s former exploration team captain, suddenly got out of control, and surprisedly penetrated the seal and came to his room, but fortunately, Silver City paid enough attention to it. Always guarded, otherwise it will lead to tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Sun" believes that the other party's loss of control will not be without reason, he guessed two possibilities, one is that its extraordinary path is in line with the needs of the ancient Sun God descendants, Second, the other party may have noticed the Tarot gathering and noticed the secretive pull of Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the former, it will not wait until today, until the end of the Tarot party is out of control... The big probability is the latter reason... Hey, this is my first time Meet the person who can detect the fog... The Amon is terrible! It is no wonder that their family was called "the god of the gods" in the Quaternary. Even the surname itself is a taboo... Klein subconsciously looks at the corresponding praying picture that appears to the deep red star, and carefully observes the small "sun" ", see if he is abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Klein believes that Amon will never be removed in such a simple way, even if the Silver City chief said that he is not an ontology. It is impossible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless he completely didn’t expect the strongman of Silver City to monitor him with magical items, is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he decided to let the former exploration team leader out of control and quietly penetrate the seal, there must be certain plans...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking between the thoughts, Klein looked at the eyes of the praying for the eyes to solidify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blurry and invisible "sun" is entwined with a transparent and illusory figure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has hands and feet, but like a python, twisting around the "sun", his head is behind the head of the "sun"! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the picture, he faintly wore a black classical robes, wearing a versatile bonnet with crystal-like monocles on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all this, the "sun" is unaware! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein almost took a sigh of relief and was scared by the other party’s strange means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He vaguely understands the purpose of the other party:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hosting" in the spirit of the "Sun" Waiting for the next Tarot party, God sneaked into the fog without knowing it, like a virus or a Trojan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, my control of this mysterious space may be deprived... It’s really a “god of the gods”! Fortunately, fortunately, the small "sun" is relatively straightforward, and I immediately reported this to me, and through the corresponding deep red stars, with the help of the power above the fog, I was able to discover his peculiar state... Klein Take a breath and try to calm yourself down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he must respond, or quickly find a way to remove the Amon in the "sun", or temporarily exclude the "sun" from the tower Luo party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examine yourself, from the extraordinary ability of "Magician", "Clown" and "Divination" to Aztec copper whistle, "Black Emperor" card, all black Klein failed to find a way to deal with the Amon, such as eyes, sun brooch, biotoxin bottles, etc.:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking for a moment, looking around, Klein found that only the fog, only this mysterious space, has the possibility to solve Amon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must find a way to incite its power... The previous sacrifices and rituals are examples... With such an idea, Klein turned his attention to that This "Book of Secrets." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is derived from the mysterious books of the ancient Witch King Karaman, which records many secret rituals that pray for help to the original moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And previously, Klein vaguely remembered that several of them were suitable for this scenario. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, after the point is changed to "fool", what changes will be made to the corresponding, will it be effective, all belong to the unknown, can only be used as a dead horse The mentality of the living horse doctor to try... Klein flipped the book and stared at a ceremony:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bloodmoon ritual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ritual magic is significantly different from the simple type that Klein used to learn, using the meta-element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process is to first write a subtle object on a piece of animal leather with a material that is rich in spirituality, preferably the blood of an extraordinary person. Name, draw the corresponding symbol and magic logo, if necessary, specific time-specific location-specific environment also needs to be considered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing this step, the ceremony host arranged the altar, picked up the leather, continued to mourn the name, and let his spirituality spread into the leather, gradually Divergence, a little bit fit with the corresponding great existence secret, get the corresponding spiritual experience or some help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final result of this ceremony is unknown, depending on what the great existence exists in the secret existence, or, according to its own characteristics, through the secret The knowledge and strength that can be obtained by the fit are also different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This relatively vague, more subjective ritual just gave Klein a space to manipulate, and if he had prepared for the beginning to remove Amon’s gesture, The other party will inevitably make a rebellion and create a dangerous accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the object of the confession is "real creator" and "hidden sage", it is normal for the ritual to end madness... Klein swears, has a present The paper-based pen began to change the "blood moon ritual" and turned it into a ritual of "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he wants to replace the name with the "three kings of yellow and black", followed by the symbol to the one behind the "fool" seat - A unique symbol consisting of a part of the "innocent eye" that symbolizes seclusion and the "distorted line" that symbolizes change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is again the design of the corresponding magic logo based on symbolic and occult knowledge. This is the most difficult step. Once an error occurs, the whole ceremony will undergo unpredictable changes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is to modify the layout of the altar, so that it is closer to the "fool" is closer to the "king of yellow and black." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a busy time, Klein had a new ceremony, and I don’t know if it would produce a close ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully examined it several times, and after confirming it, he spread spirituality and responded with a low "sun":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I know.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have something for you to do.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Test if the ceremony is effective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik Suddenly waking up from the sleepless dreams, there is no marginal fog in front of his eyes. He is a "fool" on the top, and his ears are echoed with a period of illusory and far-reaching words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that Mr. "The Fool" occasionally asks members of the Tarot party to make some small attempts. It seems to be verifying certain things. Strange, very mobile and turned up to find out monster leather, exotic herbs and other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the spiritual material described in the ceremony, Dairik did not waste time buying it in the minaret or the underground trading market, and directly picked up the "Hurricane Axe". Cut a hole in his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
