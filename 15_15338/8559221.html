			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window curtains are tightly closed, and the interior wall lights are dying. Audrey completed the corresponding preparations according to the requirements of "Magic Mirror Divination". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, she did not specifically choose the appropriate time period, because the request to Mr. "fool" does not need such trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the candle in front of the eyes and reflecting the candlelight, his own mirror, Audrey was both interested and a little uneasy to pick up a bottle of pure dew. Sprinkle a little liquid inside on a dimly lit flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quiet and elegant taste penetrated into the nose, and Audrey recalled the time when she was only a occultist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will also make all sorts of mistakes at the beginning, and will find that at the key points of the ceremony she has forgotten to prepare to please the gods’ essential oils and pure dew. Instead of using perfume, the result is undoubtedly a failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, according to the information revealed by Mr. Fool, even if I really replaced this bottle of pure dew with my own perfume, He would also respond to me... ... Audrey Xiaokou made a gentle breath, and with "meditation" he completely calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that the uncontrollable thinking divergence is not her normal performance, and her little expectation and nervousness are magnified by the "lie" necklace! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjusting the state, Audrey clasped his hands and prayed in front of the buried nose and began to whisper in sincerity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fool who does not belong to this era;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mysterious ruler above the fog;<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king of yellow and black who is in good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret spell reverberates gently. After seven times, Audrey finds that there is something more difficult to describe in the darkness around it. It is like an undercurrent hidden in the bottom of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his head, Audrey stretched out his right hand and passed by the candlelight that did not shake at all, and smirked the mirror from top to bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, "Magic Mirror Divination" has finished the process. If the mysterious, unknown existence has an interest in it, it will use the mirror to give certain Respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, in the ancient and magnificent palace, Klein saw that the deep red star representing Miss Justice was first inflated, then shrunk and swayed The illusory light, in the end, they all have a deep black secret, which condenses into a mirror-sized aperture that seems to lead to the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the same as the previous rituals, it’s a bit interesting... Klein leaned back on the back of the chair and spread out the spirituality, with the dark black circle that looks like a hole Shape contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, his vision changed. The bronze long table, the deep red star and the spacious room under the candlelight overlapped, but the boundaries distinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Klein feels that a mirror has become an extension of his own body's eyes, helping him to clearly see and interfere with the real world above the fog. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, clear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things in Kline’s sight are not in the gray blur, clearly in his eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His gaze suddenly solidified for two seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are a girl wearing a golden lace white dress, her blond long hair is casually held, soft and shiny. Her green eyes reflected a slightly pale fire, deep and deep like the sea, and like the purest gemstones. Her facial features and her face matched with thrilling beauty, her temperament is elegant and pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein inexplicably removed his gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I almost thought it was a witch with a low sequence, but I remembered in time that the "just" lady is the extraordinary person of the "audience" approach, and it is impossible to become a witch... The smell of pure dew is very good, very special... This subtle touch, the magical item made by the extraordinary features of “No Face Man”? Miss "Justice" turned it into a necklace... Kline's gaze fell on the magical item disguised as a diamond necklace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he heard Miss "Justice" speak with full expectation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic Mirror, Mirror, please tell me, the owner of this note." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey knows that he is asking "Mr. Fool", but the words of "Magic Mirror" have always been like this since she was a child. Read it out, and now I have finally had the opportunity to put it into practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failed before, no, um! Audrey nodded herself in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately looked at the black note between the candle and Miss Justice, and found that his spirituality could easily spread out through the mirror. Like the hand, "hold" the divination medium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, he quickly wrote the corresponding divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This book The note was originally the owner’s whereabouts.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand holds the note, holding the paper in one hand, and Klein leans back to the back of the chair, With the help of meditation, I quickly entered the sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey took a pair of green eyes, looked at the mirror seriously and focused, waiting for Mr. "fool" to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, she finally saw the water ripples on the mirror and swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful! "Magic Mirror Divination" is really useful! Audrey’s eyes widened, reflecting the flashing picture in the mirror:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a rural overlook! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene is getting closer and closer, and the dragon paintings on each building are becoming clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A church quickly occupied the main body of the mirror and was immediately replaced by its attached cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the picture is fixed in a tombstone in the corner. The inscription above is as early as the sun, the rain shower, the wind is blowing, and it is only vaguely visible. Know the name "Lindrilla". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the mirror suddenly darkened and immediately returned to normal, re-explaining Audrey and the candle in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn’t this the country that had the custom of worshipping dragons? The knight who wrote the notes was called Lindridge, one of them. After returning to his hometown after the failure of the 20-year war, he died. Or is he being transported back to his hometown in a corpse state? Uh... that village belongs to East Chester, and Stowe is also in East Cheshire. The notes that Associate Professor Michel has received are from normal. There is indeed a living in the collective subconscious sea. The soul dragon... Audrey was appreciative of the "fool", ending the "magic mirror divination." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the candlelight, she stared at the notes for a while, and finally decided to turn it in, see what the "mental alchemy club" can divinate, what to investigate . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least I don’t have the strength to touch the soul dragon now, I can only do this... and even if the “mental alchemy club” really found something, there is a certain The harvest, when I grow up step by step, the status within the organization rises, they will also belong to me in part ~ Audrey's mood soon became good again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, Kline fingers tap the edge of the bronze long table In combination with the statement made by Miss Justice, I made my own judgment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The note that country is related to a dragon, and the dragon often means Treasure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the strength of Miss "Justice" is not enough, otherwise I would like to marry her to explore, and pray for "Poseidon" when encountering the situation. I have given support from all sides. Well, this is too dangerous for her. I can only give up temporarily... If the "Psychological Alchemy Club" fails to find a problem, I might try it later... Klein suppresses the regret, and recalls the "magic" The experience of mirror divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This divination method is excellent for third parties and can connect to the real world at almost no cost. If I was willing, I could even The form of the spirit is drilled out of the mirror! But it is very dangerous for the user to be unprotected and presented under the gaze of the unknown and mysterious 'eyes', which are attached, manipulated, cursed, and Pollution...” Klein lamented sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
