			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, we don't..." Kline's rebuttal words are still in the future, and Banson interrupted with a smile: "Although Elizabeth's age is really small." A little, although her family situation is much better than us, I think you are quite suitable, but you may have to wait a few years, she is studying in public school, the goal is to enter the university, marriage is at least six seven After the year, of course, you can get engaged first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......You don’t want to think so long or not... Klein took a breath: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like Elizabeth, um, accurately, yes, I don't like girls who are much younger than me, I like to be mature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, within a reasonable range, I can accept it, but not now... He reluctantly added a sentence to his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you like maturity?” Melissa frowned. “Then you have to solve the marriage problem as soon as possible.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? Klein really couldn't understand the idea of ​​his sister's jumping, and he asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa explained very seriously: "When you have enough money for your future marriage, you are almost twenty-five years old. The girl who is a little older than you is either married or already engaged. Do you want to pursue a widow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this with?... Klein sullenly replies in Chinese with a sad face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson smiled and refuted his sister:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melissa, you don't understand, In today's middle class, it is not uncommon for a 30-year-old woman who is not married or engaged. They are mainly goddess believers. Most of them have the ability to make themselves a good life. They prefer to be single and do not want to accept a dissatisfaction. Marriage, amount, I saw in the "Family" magazine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Melissa is only a 16-year-old girl. I don’t know much about similar things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing your brother and sister are more interested, Klein coughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am more mature, it refers to the state of mind, not necessarily older than me, and it is Banson who is more worried about marriage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, Brother, I am also forced to do so... He silently apologized in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Melissa snorted and then focused on "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Originally, I wanted to talk about the marital problem of the middle class. Banson suddenly shuddered and looked at his sister's way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am In the turning point of my life, I must put all my energy into study. When I have a satisfactory job and a certain savings, I will have the confidence to pursue my favorite lady and give her a good life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and Melissa are the first to sneak out at the same time: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a favorite lady?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a casual perfunctory, Benson’s time was shocked and he shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just an example!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Hilston District, Building slightly drowsy dark inside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the fireplace without ignition, a middle-aged man with two white flowers took a dark pipe and sat in a rocking chair, looking at the sofa area with a deep gaze Visitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the owner here, Essinger Stanton, a very famous private detective in the small circle, but he did not open a firm, just invited a bit The assistant helped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger, wearing a white shirt and black vest, put the pipe to his mouth, took a sip of intoxication and slowly spit out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The half-hour consultation fee is 1 pound. If I were you, I would definitely not waste a second."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ladies in the sofa area are It was Foss Wall and Hugh Dilcha. They collected the information of the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qilingus, and planned to ask the big detectives who are good at deducting the law to help summarize the behavior of the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, they have hidden the name of the Kiringes and changed the description of the extraordinary content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the face is thin, angular, blue and dark Essinger, Hugh Dilcha handed the paper bag to the other's assistant A young man with golden spectacles and temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Detective, I hope that you can find out the behavior of the target in Beckland from the data."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is not tall, but when Hugh Dilcha sat straight and sat down, the majesty still made people want to obey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger took a deep look at her, took the file bag from the assistant, untied the entanglement, and pulled out the information inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put down the pipe, focused on reading, one by one, no omissions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, the two white gentlemen slowly tapped the handrail:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The goal is paranoid about the wind... Then, in the 'dust capital' Beckland, he certainly will not choose a long-term residence in a heavily polluted area, that is, he may live in Queens, West, Hexi Erston District, Jowood District, or the outskirts of the North District..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goal is a serial killer with mental illness, every other day, murder A living person... It’s reasonable to target the homeless tramp. In Beckland, even the police can’t figure out how many tramps...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The target area is not too close to the east of the tramp, Beckland Bridge, etc. It will not be too close, and it will not be too far... Frequently looking for victims around is an immature performance. Your description does not match... and if it takes a long time to find the object you want to murder, the target may not control Your own desires, commit crimes when they are easily exposed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goal is a senior sailor with a very good ability to perform underwater activities... a reasonable inference Yes, the place where he lives is not too far from the river. Once an accident occurs, it will be his best choice for safe escape..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In summary, we can outline the scope of the target. He lives in a location not far from the Beckland Bridge area, considering the West and Jowood areas. On both sides of the Tsock River..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The information you give can only be reasoned Out of this content."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I didn’t understand it very well, it seems to make sense... Hugh and Fols looked at each other, Zheng focused, and recovered the information. , got up and said goodbye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the assistant to send the two ladies out of the back, two white flowers Essinger pulled out a brass jewelry from the vest pocket, that is a This pocket-sized, open book has a vertical eye in the center of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger swayed the rocking chair and snorted while whispering:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Qilingers sneak into Beckland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plitz Hong Kong, a basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upside down man" Alger sat in a chair, coldly looking at the man who was struggling in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man is dressed as a sailor, his head is completely wrapped in a pale blue water film, and his face is red and purple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands are constantly clutching on his face, but only a drop of liquid can be pulled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he couldn’t stand it and gave a signal of yield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger’s mouth twitched and he patted his hand casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale blue water film immediately disintegrated, turned into a raindrop, and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailor dressed man sighed and gasped, panting and coughing, coughing to tear the heart and cracking the lungs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the other party calms down, Alger leans back and imitates the calm and indifferent tone of the fool:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me, the purpose of Qieringers to Beckland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He, he is to complete a commission, but specifically what I don't know." The pirate completely lost his will to resist, and replied honestly and frankly, "I only know the benefits he may have. Zilingers once proudly mentioned before us, if this time If things go well, he will get an item that he has dreamed for for a long time, and the 'four kings' in the pirates will also become 'five kings'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream is long article? Alger frowned and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday morning, Klein still couldn’t rest and continued to follow the plan. Check out the houses with red chimneys in Tingen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this time, he still could not find the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned home at noon, warming up the leftovers last night, licking oatmeal bread, and then making an hour of sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 2:40, Klein put down the books in his hands, sealed the bedroom with spirituality, and once again entered the mysterious space above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat freely on the bronze long table, did not control the frequency of the "sun" heartbeat, extended his right hand and gave a response in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek. Berg is sweating on the driving range, suddenly stunned in front of him, saw heavy fog, saw the depths of the fog sitting high The "fool" on the back chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was first stunned, and immediately stopped moving, lowering his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the "illusion" disappeared, he counted his own heartbeat, holding a silver-white straight sword and striding to the rest area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a thousand heartbeats, he has locked himself in a separate washroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaiting a dozen more hours of breathing, he saw the deep red light coming from the void, and drowning himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, Klein leaned back on the back of the chair, and the left tooth twitched twice, quietly turning on the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the depths of the etheric body of the "sun", the mottled color became pure, like the morning sun, so he smiled and said:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, Mr. Singer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he also found the other star behind the high back chair Flying fast, reorganized into a symbol of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without my mind, it naturally changes, just like conditioned reflexes... well, except for palaces, long tables and chairs, others come out Nothing can be saved after I left here... They are very special... There are so many secrets above the fog... Klein looked thoughtfully at everything in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick lowered his head again and replied in a restrained and humble way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From your help, this is just the beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not surprised that the fool can see that he has taken the potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein took out the silver pocket watch and glanced at it and chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Then we will start the party, remember, after that, it is probably this frequency, um, or interval."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
