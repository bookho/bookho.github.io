			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret was uploaded for two months, and it was time to go to the shelves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two months, I have hardly written any testimonials, and I haven’t communicated with you. This is mainly because I feel more and more, authors and The best communication for readers must also be in the novel. What I want to express, what I want to tell, are in the story I wrote, and I don’t need to say anything extra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, back to the book "The Lord of Secrets", I am probably such an idea, trying to find the kind of fun when I first came into contact with online novels. The kind of "Oh, there is such a world" "There is such a magical world" fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, each book gave me a different look, a strange, interesting world, so that I always open my eyes, always Indulge in self-improvement, always extended imagination, of course, this is also the reason that I have been exposed to too few similar novels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when I feel that I am ready to do everything in my own way to build a more novel world and an interesting and novel system, I Uneasy, and brave enough to start the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 22 channels with "playing the law" as the core, 220 kinds of potions, 220 different "professionals", this is what I most hope to make everyone interested. In addition, there is also a world that is mixed with the Cthulhu style, the elements of the SCP Foundation, the style of the first industrial revolution, and the feeling of steampunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read a lot of books and made a lot of settings, but I know that what I need most is to tell the story well, not in a hurry. Speaking out, this is why I have slowed down the first part of the rhythm and updated the free chapter of 410,000 words. I have to go through the plot honestly, to sketch the characters, to depict the world, not to pursue the so-called Climax, presenting the picture that I want to share with you in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the writing of Master Wu Dao, I also have an attractive level in daily stories, with the ability to write stories honestly and writing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I learned to express, or every writer and author, instinctively expressed, and now, I think I began to learn restraint, many times I will tell you whether you will use emotions, words and expressions to express emotions, not to do inner monologues, or even use actions, words and expressions. It is so cold and cold, just like a white woman. Chapter, this is also the level I can hope to maintain in the key paragraphs of the Secret Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various structures of this book are probably the most comprehensive ones in my book, and we will wait and see what we are looking forward to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is the idea and attempt of my book. I hope that everyone will like it. I hope that you can use the subscription to insist. After all, I still have to eat, still have to Buy a dress for a wife and buy a dress to buy a house to buy a house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always been a vulgar person. I never doubt this. At the same time, I am also a very lazy person with a very problematic personality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have thought about organizing my fans, just like other authors, but, oh, it’s so annoying, so tired, then there’s no more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once thought about opening a Weibo, gathering popularity, but, oh, it’s so annoying, so tired, then, no, then, I don’t. I know how long I have not updated Weibo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got the WeChat public account and tried to write something, but, oh, it’s so annoying, so tired, and then it’s only a long time to update it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried to ask people to help the public, but when I saw the content of others, I always felt embarrassed and always felt blushing, so I stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, I want to make a settlement with myself now, admit it, you are a lazy person, you are a person with flaws in interpersonal relationship, you are a You are a person who doesn't like to be disturbed by all kinds of chores. You are a person who can't help the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, what I can do well and are willing to do is to write a novel, which is a story about my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is the reconciliation between me and myself. I don’t want to stop working anymore. I don’t want to ask for anything that is popular. The public number is what I think. There is more content, I didn’t expect it, um, reconciliation is just a persuasion of literature and art. Accurate description should be self-defeating, here manually funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
