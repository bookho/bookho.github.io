			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief silence, Klein took a black tea and took a sip, laughing and saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is a choice, you can consider it, but Russell has said that you should never rush to make a decision. Only after repeated comparisons can you get the best answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is there any other option? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter's expression in white gloves is not unusually said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pesfi Street can also meet your requirements. I remember that the house on the 9th is looking for a tenant. It is a villa type, two floors, a dozen rooms, with a stable, a servant room and a small garden. The furniture and utensils are relative. Obsolete, but still decent, the annual rent is 220 pounds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This price is reasonable...reasonable...but Pesferfair 9 means no more than 100 meters from the Saint-Sauveur church, although this is very In line with the theory of black under the lamp, there must be a lot of night-timers in the passers-by. When I want to leave and return secretly, it is very inconvenient and easy to go wrong... The original rent budget is only one hundred and fifty-six. The pound's Klein was baptized by the price of the garden building in front, and suddenly felt that 220 pounds was not bad.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him doubt if the steward Walter deliberately said first Expensive.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are there? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter replied impatiently with impatientness:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Berclund Street 160 The number of houses is also rented. It is also a three-story building with a garden, a stable, and a servant room. There are more than a dozen rooms, but the location is not as good as that of the 32nd. The furnishings and furniture can only be called decent. The annual rent is 315 pounds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;315 pounds... Klein’s mind flashed the rent price slightly, numbly asking:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your suggestion? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he already has an answer in his heart, but as an employer, he can’t rush to express his position, because if there is any common sense in the decision, it is easy to be People look down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter seriously thought:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Berkelen Street 160 No. that building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In comparison, the neighbors here are more helpful for you to enter the upper class, and the house on the 32nd is too luxurious, and direct rental will make The neighbors around you think that you lack the necessary conservation and are not good enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, when you first arrive, you rent a house for 1,260 pounds per year, which is easily defined by neighbors. Upstarts who are eager to show off... For a rich man who is committed to entering the upper class, such a wind comment is very bad... Klein has a lipstick tea, and he asks: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why do you want to propose this option at 32 Burke Lund Street?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter did not hesitate to take a ritual: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Sir, I am just a butler. My responsibility is not to make decisions, but to show all the appropriate options and make some suggestions for your reference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know your specific preferences, I have to give as much as possible For target selection. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very professional...He should be worried about Dawn. Dontes is a nouveau riche, so the first to give Berkrend Street This choice of 32 contains some degree of temptation, in order to adjust the suggested direction and management style later... Klein smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exclude The house on the 32nd, we choose one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before making a decision, I used to go to the site to see, we set off after lunch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, sir." Walter was still serious and old-fashioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South Bridge, the harvest church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White was wiping the silver candlestick while thinking about the clues provided by Miss Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A hidden extraordinary party... This is equivalent to not providing clues. It is quite difficult to track down, and I can’t join that in a short time. Party..." Emlin looked at the surface of the silverware, examined himself, and raised his hand to comb his hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he put the rag on, put it back to the first row of chairs in the church, sat down, and looked at the Utrechtsky bishop in the sun without a focal length. Pray carefully in front of the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One idea after another jumped out, sometimes sparked, and Emlin suddenly grasped a detail:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Why would there be a puppet that would make the 'primitive moon' believers extremely interested?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon puppet, the moon puppet... it feels like Fishing bait, is it a trap designed by Russ Bartoli? Emlin's eyes lit up and Huo Di stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russ Bartoli is a blood clan who is involved in the hunting competition and is regarded by Emlin as the strongest competitor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin wants to think that this is possible, because he remembers Bartoli is an antiquities enthusiast, especially like to collect strange strange monsters from the Southland. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps back and forth, his mouth twitched a little and snorted, silently saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't enter the extraordinary person's party to Chawengsha's fall of the 'primitive moon' believers, but I can monitor Russ Bartoli and then grab the target before him!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, I am looking forward to what kind of expression he will have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Miss 'Magician' is worth £100."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Emlin was very excited, Father Uttraski ended his prayer, came over, looked down at him, and said softly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our piety It’s not in words, it’s in every detail, and you’re not focused enough today.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Re-wipe the candlestick. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, ok. Emlin suddenly responded with sorrow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the priest turned to the confession room, he woke up and whispered with a funny and sullen voice:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not pious at all, I don't need to reflect piety! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rows of straight Intis sycamore trees stand on On both sides, the street was quiet and quiet, and Klein stepped out of the house on the 160th with a gold-plated cane.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a breath , side to the butler Walter Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You tell the owner here, I am very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only for a year, we may move to a better place, such as Queens."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sentence implied his ambition to win the title, because Queens is where the nobility gathers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why not only rent for half a year, saving money, it is because such high-end houses only accept long-term contracts, one year is the shortest period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, if you don’t save money, Klein still likes this house very well, it has a clean lawn, beautiful gardens, well-prepared houses, exquisite utensils, bedroom Numerous, enough furniture, each floor contains multiple washrooms, the rear of the stables and the servant room did not cut corners, is the best place that Klein could have imagined before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter immediately responded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
