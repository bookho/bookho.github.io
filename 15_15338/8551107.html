			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christina did not notice the divination of Mr. Diviner, and looked at the location of the reception desk, Angelica, pressing the voice: <br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean the children of Lalhous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pointed her finger at the young man wearing a lotus cap Girl Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my niece, Meigaos, her mother is my long sister, I am sorry, I am sorry, I thought Llanus was a remarkable and outstanding young man, so he introduced Mecoos ​​to the unmarried man and watched them become lovers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mei Gaoou's parents were also very satisfied with Lalhous. They planned to invest all their savings in the steel company after they got engaged. Fortunately, before this incident, Lalus escaped, which made them The family did not suffer fatal losses. Unfortunately, my sister and brother-in-law must explain to relatives and friends why the engagement ceremony was cancelled. It must be for Mei Gao’s belly. "You are troubled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We all believe in the god of steam and machinery, not the believer of the storm, do not think that lovers must be guarded before marriage, we I don’t blame Mei Gao Osi, and even sympathize with her, but the survival of the child is really embarrassing, especially he has such a father.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a scam Deceived... Klein looked at Mecoos, who was standing next to the quiet, and found the girl to be a beautiful woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a bright forehead, long blond hair, and a pair of big eyes that resemble Christina. It is melancholy and calm, and is close to her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an insane swindler, and it’s ran away... Klein cursed Lalhous and thought:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it’s a child who has already been born, I do have a way to rely on his general whereabouts of Braunus, but unfortunately, it takes a few months, um, This may be the embodiment of the previous divination results, patience, waiting, persistence, no more greed, then welcoming the turn and seeing the sun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For months... Christina murmured and shook her head. "No, after so long, even if I found Llanus, I can't get back the money..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is on the side Looking at the blond Mei Gao Osi, the voice can't help but become apathy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have anything that Lalhous has carried with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Mei Gaoousi replied in a fine and soft manner. "Is the ring that he sent me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;& "It must be an item that has been carried for a long time." Klein shook his head and denied it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christina is silent for a few seconds, watching Mecoos::<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must do I decided that leaving this child will make your life difficult and full of thorns. Do you want to tell him that his father is a fraudster and deceives many people, including his mother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s time to go to the clinic to go to the hospital, and this will help us find Llanus and get back what we lost."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, will this divination be too heavy? Klein is not good at interfering with other people's family affairs. He can only wait patiently next to him, and he will whisper from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mego Oss lowered his head and looked down, not talking for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, she touched her lower abdomen and showed a gentle smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He Unlike his father, he is a very considerate and flattering child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will kick me gently every day and tell me his mood, He will sing, whistle, and use music to help me fall asleep..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened and suddenly felt a little wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this a big blow to her and a problem with her spirit? Klein raised his right hand and reached out to his eyebrows, trying to squeeze out to ease his tiredness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Megacoo slammed and turned to the door, leaving only one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe his father will secretly return for his birth, he will retain some of his fortune..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stunned, I didn't have time to open my eyes, and I watched Meco Oss leave the club and walked down the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christina took a breath and slowed down for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Moretti Sir, I am bothering you, we will try our best to find the belongings of Lalhus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein can't see the dagger, watch her go downstairs, sigh Shake his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Klein just entered the Black Thorns Security Company. Saying hello to Roshan, he asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about today's newspaper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The sweet brown-haired girl, Roshan, looked at him and wondered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein, you are very surprised."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Klein had long expected to smile and ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosanna turned his eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before you were taking a lunch break Newspaper, because there is a occult course in the morning, hey, Daniel has been waiting for you in the arsenal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know in advance that there will be a reward for the case. So I want to turn over the newspaper and remember the appearance of the criminal. Maybe one day I met?” Klein explained with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Roshan curiously picked up several newspapers today and began to flip quickly. "The wanted order...Lalhous right?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the odious swindler! Even scammed more than 10,000 pounds!" Rosanne looked at it for a dozen seconds and suddenly turned out indignation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has the same feelings as her, and condemns it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really awful I want to take the initiative to take over the case!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosanne looked at him for more than ten seconds, and shook his head:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This case does not seem to involve extraordinary factors, and even if it is involved, it will be handed over to the storm lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Klein didn't understand Roshan's meaning too much, but after taking over the newspaper, he regretted it: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, there are so many people Being deceived, the believers of the three churches must be included, and the location of Llanus Steel is the Southern District."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case related to the extraordinary factors, If a believer who is involved in a certain god alone will be handed over to the corresponding team, but if the goddess of the night god, the master of the storm, the steam and the god of the machinery are involved, then the division belongs to the jurisdiction - Jin Hao , North and West nightwatchman who owned the team, Eastern, Southern and Docklands penalty on behalf of those who owned the team, owned by the university district and the outskirts of mechanical heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview, Klein also remembered the appearance of Lalhous:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His forehead was full, his hair was dark brown, his glasses were nearly round, and his mouth was slightly upturned, seemingly laughing at everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Rosanne chilled a few words, Klein through the partition, ready to enter the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw the pale, temperamental "collector" Frye and the black-haired "Writer" Miss Siga Thorn walked out at the same time Entertainment room, turn to yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief greeting, Klein watched his two teammates leave and found Dunn Smith wearing a black trench coat to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there a case?" Klein asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point in time, the two nights will not go out together for no reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun ash swept away, dagger smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a suspected haunted place in the West End I asked Siekka and Frye to take a look, but you don't have to care about these things. Before I master the fighting skills, I don't plan to let you participate in any tasks. I have to be responsible for my team members. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, you are such a good person, except for the high hairline, poor memory, no shortcomings... Klein sighs and confirms: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, I only need to take a occult course, do fighting training, and receive a salary without any contribution?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is only temporary." Dunn gave a definitive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only need to "listen" plus "fitness", you can get a full, generous salary, think it's pretty cool... Klein is happy I thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope there is no coincidence! He silently prayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smooth and peaceful life without waves continues until Friday, Klein is After completing the fighting practice, I arrived at Besik Street by car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the Henry Private Detective Office, he glanced around and saw a gauze mask, cocked the windbreaker collar, and quickly entered after confirming that no one was paying attention to himself. The corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocking on the door, Klein once again saw the image of the middle-aged tough guy Henry detective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, sir, one of your commissions has a result." The dark blue detective Henry said with a tobacco and alcohol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein deliberately mute the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is the one who appeared in the Dragon Bar Mr.'s message?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman who purchased the audience potion aid...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Henry raised the pipe in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he said nothing, only smiled at Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein understood the meaning of the other party, distressedly took out four 1 pound notes and handed them over:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the second payment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Write a receipt to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His private money is less than £1...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem." Henry coughed twice and examined the anti-counterfeit mark of the banknote while telling the employee to bring the paper and pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he asked Klein to sit down in the sofa area and quickly wrote the receipt and stamped it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When done all this, Henry took a smog:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to your description, My assistant and I waited for three days at the Dragon Bar and finally met the gentleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
