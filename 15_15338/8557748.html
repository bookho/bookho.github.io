Daniz clears his throat: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can ask, but I may not answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, do you think I am the adventurer and archaeologist who killed myself because of curiosity? Daniz was alert and self-satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radio ticker was quiet for a few seconds before re-squeaking, the illusory white paper spit out, with reddish words: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you crushing your captain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......I didn't! Don't talk nonsense! Who? Who told you that! Daniz’s face turned red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret that has been hidden in my heart for many years has suddenly been uncovered, leaving him at a loss, shameful and shameful, and the subconscious will deny it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, he was shocked to wonder how this thing was known to outsiders. He never told anyone to hide this secret. it is good! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz opened his mouth and forced a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem of boredom , I refuse to answer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radio ticker squeaks and spits out more white paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Then we change a question.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't really like it, who can endure such a boring and boring course for a long time, this sentence is right. Still not right? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! Because the strength is not enough, can't beat! "Daniz blurted out and his expression was distorted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ticker of the radio ticker became more and more brisk, and the words on the illusory white paper gradually increased:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We change another question.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The image of your favorite female is beautiful, powerful , mysterious, intellectual, you can step on your feet, right? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Danizi's lips are swaying, only to feel the flames rising inside the body, and the illusory black smoke is coming out of his head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, his mentality exploded, like being stripped of clothes and nakedly thrown into the bustling streets.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, he looked around in confusion, looking for and avoiding those who might look at himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he saw the door of the bedroom, I don’t know when Already open, Galman Spalo wore a white shirt and loose black trousers that were not tied into the belt, and stood there quietly, not knowing how long it was.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You, when did you come out? "Daniz's expression is faint, and the words are stuttering.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me, you just opened the door! He cried in his heart and prayed.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stepped toward the fascinating radio ticker, calmly replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beginning. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a diviner, how can you not notice the strange movements outside? Even in my sleep, I have spiritual instinct... Klein is in my heart." He snorted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz’s face turned gray, slamming his body halfway, rushing to the radio ticker that was suspected of possession of evil spirits, trying Tearing off the illusory white paper with three problems.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his hand crossed the word and caught nothing.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His palm once again condensed a red fireball and wanted to blow up the damn radio ticker.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was at this time that he was swept by the icy cold eyes of German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Yes, this is his item...Daniz is stiff there, watching Gelman Sparrow over himself, stop there Before the abnormal radio ticker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arodes... How does it connect to this radio ticker? It says it senses a uniquely familiar and about to dissipate, which means fog The 'breath' of the mysterious space above?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This radio ticker was placed on the fog for several days, although there was no variation, but It is also contaminated with breath, and because of its own functional problems, it can receive information from the spiritual world for a short time, so it seems to be known by Arrods that many mirrors have been discovered? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, what's the problem behind...I am Gelman Sparo, I am a cold and crazy adventurer, I am a professional. ... I, I can't laugh out loud..." Klein pressed his mouth and quietly took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz peeked at his side face, like a prisoner waiting for a rope on a gallows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Greman. Sparo has no expression changes, he is a little relieved, thankfully just watching a madman, not a normal human, not for this kind of thing What will be of interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is another pirate, I will not have a face back to the "Golden Dream", no, no face adventure at sea! He hated and feared to look at the radio ticker and cast it on the devil who claimed to be Arrodes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the groaning sound again, and saw the radio ticker spit out new white paper with two lines of elegant and elegant Lunwen:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your loyal and humble servant, Arrods, is honored to follow your footsteps again and wait for you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......This is not an evil spirit just now. Arnolds is slightly smeared, and suddenly thinks that this is not true enough tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no easy to suppress the smile of Klein from the case just now, keenly noticed a problem, that is, Arodes itself is not here, it should It is through the "special function" of the spirit world and the radio ticker to send the information remotely. Therefore, when Daniz refuses to answer the first question, it is unable to give a punishment and can only change one question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is quite interesting. After putting the radio ticker on the fog for a long time, you can turn it into a message that receives ghost information. Unique items? Unfortunately, the extraordinary characteristics are conserved. Even if the radio receiver only has the addition of fog, the extraordinary function will dissipate a little bit and eventually return to normal...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well, according to my occult knowledge, without the extraordinary characteristics, in order to maintain the extraordinary nature of ordinary objects for a long time, there is another way, that is, to use the name and real name of angels and even gods." The language of nature is engraved on it... This is equivalent to borrowing 'mystery' from the other side, borrowing 'power', of course, if they agree... I can't do it myself, at least I used to write the password in ancient Hermes. 'The paper has not yet been mutated...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the real god, I know that there is one real name, 'The original witch' Chik... If I get him Name, plus real name, What happens when the ancient Hermes language is engraved on this radio ticker? Will it release the virus, will it become more industrial and aesthetic, will make the fetish obsessed...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"", the biggest possibility is that when I engraved the name and real name, I was reduced to the power of the 'original witch' and drained on the spot... This is a very very precise supernatural point..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein flashed some wonderful ideas in a flash, until Arrods greeted him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp That's right, this is the mirror that can answer the question... Kline's heart is moving, sideways to Daniz Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go outside the door . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...OK! Daniz rushed to the door without hesitation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was afraid that the devil called Arrods would ask a new question!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving in Nitz to enter the corridor and closing the door, Klein turned to the radio ticker connected to the Mirror Arrodes, said: <br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
