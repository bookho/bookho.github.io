			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the quiet bar where you can hear some people breathing, Klein took two seconds to step in, as if nothing had happened, directly Going to the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time I came over, I changed my mind... He thought in his heart, only to reach out and cover his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Oak Law did not know that Gilman Sparo had successfully hunted the "slayer" Gilshies, let Klein think that he is the latest The situation has not yet reached the "city of generosity", so I am confident that I came to the "seaweed bar". Who knows, the problem lies in the Okrufa away from the adventurer circle, the news is lagging behind, the fierce adventurer’s fierce name is already Among the pirates near the Rothde Islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a silent sigh, Klein sat in front of the bar and slammed the boardwalk:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "One cup of Southwell beer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...6pence." The bartender swallowed hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took out a few copper pennies in front of him and asked with no change in expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What's the situation recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender took the pennies and carefully sent the beer to the front of German Sparrow, then squeezed out the smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Admiral Levitte was transferred back to Beckland, and Admiral Robert Davis took over his position and became the kingdom here. The naval supreme commander of the sea area, the situation in the entire archipelago is a bit nervous, and many pirate groups sent people to inquire about the news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admiral Amyrius eventually Was involved in his younger brother, lost his current position... However, as long as he did not directly participate, as a demigod, there will be no worse situation, at least the treatment of the general can be saved, the family will not What problem, wait for things to calm down, maybe there is still a chance to continue to be the top of the navy... Klein sipped a beer and asked casually <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which family is Robert Davis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, he is not a nobleman He was a rare person who walked from the bottom officer to the position of the general. In the raging sea, on the island of Sunia, in East Byron, he received countless merits." The bartender recalled the recent newspaper. The praise of General Robert Davis, paused. "But I heard that he has been funded by many nobles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in The current Royal Navy, a royal family, aristocrat, or a general who has close ties with the royal family and the nobility, accounts for at least 80%, and the remaining 20% ​​is also concentrated on the level of Brigadier General and Major General... Klein has long since Amirius. The file there at Levitt is aware of this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Army is much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Greman. Sparo did not ask again, like drinking intently, the bartender turned to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;" In the past two months, the Rebels were very active. They have been trying to destroy the railways or block the roads. The Governor’s Office is very troublesome. They have to send a large number of troops to protect traffic, but they can resist the army. Less conflict with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that it’s all according to my plan...where an indigenous and mixed-race population is 80% of the population, It is not too difficult for the rebels to get accurate information. With external funding, they will survive in a short period of time. The problem is not serious. The reason why they are in danger in the past is because the sea snake of Cavitewa has nothing. Reason, always let them attack the city to occupy the main points, and fight against the naval and army of the kingdom of Lun... Klein sighed a few words and drank a good beer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also warned the rebels to keep them from being too active. If the Governor’s House is forced into a very embarrassing situation, the Kingdom of Lun is likely to be good at sending Tracking the search sequence 5, even the semi-god-level extraordinary person to assist, the resistance of the army is simply not possible to confront, Klein gave them the instructions in the name of "Poseidon", maintain and slightly improve the status quo, waiting for the world situation to change . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will not be too far away. According to the various situations of Miss Justice, the "downside down" has a positive judgment, that is, as long as Lun The kingdom completed the internal bureaucratic system reform, which made the original and new armored fleets form a force, and a war against the colonies of the southern continent was inevitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, he saw the child with a thin curly-brown hair and saw the indigenous people dressed in the brown jacket wide-leg pants. These people were afraid to avoid, dare not look up, or shrunk to the side, watching Klein with complicated eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein reluctantly hooked his mouth and silently returned to the hotel room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t change his appearance immediately, and went to various bars to find pirates, because those guys would definitely hide in tonight and would not appear again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Klein planned to explore the "Grossel Travels", his door suddenly slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without asking, just holding the handle, his mind naturally showed the appearance of the visitor:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Middle-aged, male, wearing a dark red jacket and white trousers, wearing a boat-shaped hat, the eyes, forehead, mouth have obvious wrinkles, it is the captain of the "White Onyx", military personnel, just Elland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s amazing, the news that I appeared in Baiam has just spread, I found out which hotel I live in, which room... Of course, because I did not cover up, directly registered with the identity document... Klein twisted the handle, pulled the door, and politely said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, I’m glad you went back to Baiam." Elland took off his hat and entered the room without restriction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?" Klein pulled the chair and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erlan immediately sat across from the opposite side and chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Visiting friends is not The most important thing?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really can talk, but unfortunate Anderson has left, otherwise he has to let him study and learn! Klein was inexplicably touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He maintains a consistent attitude and looks at Airland’s eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have already visited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerland seems to have expected such an answer, laughing: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember Donna?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, she and her brother are very cute, don’t know if they have been "intimidated" by me. "There was a shadow in the shadows, and I lost my curiosity to the mysterious world... Klein calmly responded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no amnesia."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forgetting something that is not important is good for the health of our souls, huh, this is not what Russell the Great said." Elland simply explained, "You Didn't tell Donna's father, if you need help, in the "Sunia Morning Post", for three consecutive days to publish an advertisement for the purchase of Damir's special cured meat? He did this during this time, but unfortunately you are not in Baiam. Not in Near the sea "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;".? And then, "Klein Yi Erlan see attitude easily, intuitively believe that Donna did not suffer too serious a matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerland laughed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard your conversation and found After the advertisement, I visited the family in the past according to the address. You know, Donna is a cute little girl who always reminds me of my daughter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The matter is not complicated. Uldi, the father of Donna, has been robbed of the goods of high value by the 'Crazy Captain', which makes his economic situation very bad, although it will not go bankrupt. But life will definitely be a lot harder, so I want to entrust you to get the goods back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that you were not in Byam at the time, so you had to use your own channels to get Uldi to get the goods back at a great price." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crazy Captain"? Klein first felt that this nickname was familiar, and immediately remembered where he had heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
