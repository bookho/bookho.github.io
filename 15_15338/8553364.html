			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking the steam subway to the south bank of the Tsok River, Klein hired a horse-drawn carriage to the Auston Cemetery on the outskirts of the Southern District, which is steam and machinery. God church management. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness of the evening, the trees around the cemetery swayed and clawed, as if they were a monster hidden in the night. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the 4 Sule fee paid by Klein, the driver took a look at the cemetery and muttered and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you need to wait for you here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, I am coming to visit a friend." Klein casually For a reason, I immediately noticed that the driver's face suddenly changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a cemetery... Come visit a friend... It’s already dark... The driver heard the sound of his heart screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein came back and smiled and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is The guardian of the grave here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver suddenly relieved, but did not dare to stop, busy driving the horse, quickly leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned around the cemetery for half a lap until the night really fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dark, the emission of soot has been reduced a lot, coupled with the cold wind, the fog in the air is thin, although still can not see a few The stars, but the blushing moon is faintly revealed, covering the ground with a gauze-like brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein clicked clockwise four times on the chest, drew the moon, then put on the gloves and flipped over the iron fence with one push. Cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around with a high alert and found a secluded corner at random, taking out the Azick copper whistle and holding it in his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from him, there is a tombstone, the photo above is dirty, and the epitaph is very vague under the moonlight, and Klein has carefully identified it. After a few seconds, I figured out what exactly was written:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Friends passing by, please pull me, thank you!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very humorous gentleman...just you! Klein stopped and leaned back against the nearby trees that sheltered the sun and rain from the tomb, waiting patiently in the cold and cold night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He throws high Azick copper whistle, and catches it steadily, throws it high again, catches it again, so he spends his time until twenty minutes later . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No signs of corpse change... Klein closed the pocket watch and looked around to confirm the result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After two days, come here to see if there are any additional changes. If it does not, it means that Mr. Azick’s copper whistle cannot affect the acceptance of the pastor priests. The body of the requiem ritual.” Klein silently said, returning the old and delicate copper whistle back to his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the kingdom of Lun, the funeral is generally divided into three types. The first one is a coffin with a corpse, which is suitable for the upper middle class with a relatively rich life, and the second has no corpse. Direct cremation, burial in the casket, which is the choice of the lower middle class and skilled workers who can pay for the cremation but feel that the coffin is too wasteful, but sometimes there are religious and governmental factors, such as the believers of the eternal sun. Most cremations, such as the poor who receive government help, are all cremation and only charge a small fee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third kind belongs only to the poor, who can not afford to buy coffins, and do not want to be cremated, just wrap up something to bury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Klein has just judged from the shape of the tombstone and the tomb that the object of his experiment is the one with the coffin and the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Aziz’s copper whistle can really make the other person’s corpse change, even if the target may rot into white bone early, it will not be unresponsive, even if it is not open The coffin cover of the earth and slate can at least create a dull sound of cockroaches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I have to categorize it. This is a corpse that has been buried for a long time. I have to find a target that I just buried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only in this way, the most accurate judgment can be made. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Klein and the grave guards caught the secret and found a grave that completed the burial ceremony during the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he waited for half an hour and still found no anomalies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call, basically can judge that Mr. Azick’s copper whistle can not affect the body that received the resurrection ceremony, which is a little weak, no, no, this copper The whistle itself is not used to make the corpse, its role is to summon the messenger, affecting the body is a negative effect!" Klein tightened the double-breasted long dress and walked toward the iron fence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He plans to go home and change clothes for a second set of experiments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group targets the bodies that have not received the resurrection ceremony and have not died for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This goal often exists in hospital morgues! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the fence, Klein stepped back to the Southern District step by step in the clear dark night, surrounded by dead and peaceful, only the evergreen trees covered with dust. Gently sway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds him of the night of his resurrection, which was also from the cemetery to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哎... Klein sighed and suddenly started running, as if he wanted to open that kind of shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, he hired a rental carriage in the Southern District, the destination is the nearest steam subway station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With almost an hour, the steam subway will be out of service, which will save him a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early hours, Klein changed his gray-blue worker uniform Wearing a top hat, he came to the St. Justin Hospital in the Beckland Bridge area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a charity hospital belonging to the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of the bottom poor died here because of illness, there is no place to put the body in the house, they have to be stored in the hospital morgue, waiting for the government to cremate or donate In medical school, this phenomenon is especially common in summer, but there are not many autumn and winter after the cool down. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the era when there is no cold air and no cryogenic device, the hospital’s morgue will not let the body stay too long, and willing to donate quickly to prevent the treatment. The next day, the burial will be cleaned up. Of course, this is the summer rule. It will be looser in autumn and winter. Therefore, during this time, there are still many bodies in the morgue every night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vestibule of St. Justin’s Hospital is on the basement level. Even in summer, it is quite cool, and it is cold and bitter in autumn and winter. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein based on the knowledge learned in the night squad, relying on the flexibility and balance of the clown, sneaked in, shunned the doctors and nurses on duty, and entered the underground layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not been close to the morgue, he feels cold and gloomy nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly flashed through the janitor's room, Klein took out the wire and lightly opened the door lock of the morgue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the techniques for sneaking and tracking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly and silently pushed the door of the morgue with the right palm of the black glove, while at the same time he spread spiritually and wrapped up Zick copper whistle, want to confirm whether this way can eliminate the negative effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature in the morgue seems to be lower than the corridor. Most of the dead here are packed in body bags and placed in different iron cabinets. Only a small amount was placed on the long table in the central open space, as if waiting for inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a "clown" in Sequence 8, Klein has little fear of this scene, but instinctively feels uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, Klein chilled out and confirmed that the body had not changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost... He took out the gold-shelled pocket watch and glanced at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being prepared, Klein took back the spirit and no longer used it to wrap the Azick copper whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s a psychological effect, he feels more and more quiet around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a diviner, he fully believed in consciously, stopped moving back and forth, and retreated to the vicinity of the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, and Klein thinks it will take about two minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a body on the long table suddenly sat up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an intensive slap in the surrounding iron cabinets, and there seemed to be something to hatch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! Klein listened to such movements and looked at a corpse sitting up and suddenly lowered his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blush!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he infused spirituality into the "Requiem of the Soul" and threw it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice-blue flame is quietly burning, the soft and soft blackness is diffused, and the body is lying down again, the shot from the iron cabinet The sound of the sound came to an abrupt end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein who has experienced similar scenes has not slackened, and once again used a "Soul of the Soul". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the large number of corpses here, he was insured and used the third one to run out of stock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good... It really only affects the body that has not been subjected to the resurrection ceremony, and it has not been long before death. The living body is also included, and it can be covered with spirituality. Block this effect." Kline smiled and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw no abnormal reaction in the body, ready to pull the door to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he suddenly heard a footstep coming from outside and saw the faint light infiltrating into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man who was watching the door was attracted by the slap in the morgue, carrying the lantern and coming close! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked around and pressed the door to flexibly jump and climb, staying at the door and ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held a very good balance by licking his bumps and gaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man who opened the door opened the door with a key and entered the morgue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a few steps forward, raised the lantern, examined the iron cabinet and the long table, and examined the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind him, Klein jumped lightly and landed silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catch the opportunity, Klein quickly escaped from the morgue, first avoided the small room with the janitor for a few seconds, and then carefully returned to the upper level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The janitor checked it again and found nothing unusual. He was a little afraid of the body and muttered, and quickly left, locked the door and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the guard room, he wrapped up the thin quilt and spent a few minutes to calm down the rushing heartbeat and whispered two words:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old guys always told me about the anomalies that happened in the morgue. I wanted to scare me. The strange voice should have been counted, and it’s not so good. Those bodies. I haven't lived yet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, there are living corpses and resentments!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
