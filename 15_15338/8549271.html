			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein couldn’t help but step back, not knowing if he was awake, or still in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure took off the black top hat and bowed a small amount, smiling low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Re-recognize, the night, Dunn Smith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night? What is the name of the extraordinary team of the Goddess of the Night, which was mentioned by "justice" and "downside down"? Klein was a bit confused. Before re-association, he suddenly blurted out and debuted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You manipulate the dream? You made me dream like that?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night-timer, Dunn Smith, puts on the black top hat to cover the slightly higher hairline, and the dark, dark eyes are filled with smiles:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I just enter your dreams and do the necessary guidance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is mellow and soft Don't disturb other people's dreams and echo in the corridor of dark glimmer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the dream, although there will be ordinary suppressed emotions and various dark mental enlargement Rendering, making everything seem confusing, ridiculous and crazy, but the reality still exists, still hidden in it. For me as a veteran, all are obvious and easy to see, I believe in you in a dream more than you are sober. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...can anyone control their dreams? If I dreamed about something on earth, wouldn't I be discovered by Dunn Smith? Klein was shocked and afraid of the dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he quickly made some surprises, because he remembered that he was sober in his dreams, very rational, knowing what to say and what not to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, it’s not like dreaming at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Dunn Smith just "sees" what I want him to see? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s thoughts turned sharply, and there was a hint of enlightenment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a self-contained benefit, such as the speciality of its own spirit, or the additional influence of the "transportation ceremony"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, Mr. Smith, are you sure that I really lost my memory?" Klein organized a language to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean Smith did not answer directly, but instead gave him a deep look:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You I am not surprised by this kind of thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The party I met before even if I just finished my dream, I don’t believe that there will be extraordinary power, I would rather think I haven't really woke up yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein "Hmm" one voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Maybe because I am praying, I am looking forward to such a force to help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"very interesting thinking logic...may you survive not only It’s because of luck.” Dunn nodded with no smile. “I can confirm that you really lost some of the memory because of this incident, especially the relationship event itself.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I can go back?" Klein sighed with a sigh of relief and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun entered the bag with one hand and walked slowly, and the surrounding night became quiet and gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you still have to go see me with an ‘expert.’” He politely uplifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Klein blurted out and added, "Do you not believe in your guidance of dreams?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of jokes, if the "experts" are good at hypnosis, reading the heart and so on, then my biggest secret is not exposed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the results be unimaginable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have always been modest, but there is still some confidence in the dream." Dunn calmly answered calmly. "However, the key and important things are confirmed again. Not to mention, she and I are good at it." Different, may help you to restore a certain memory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for Klein to say that his voice has become heavy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "After all, you are concerned with the whereabouts of the Antignus family note."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Klein stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den is in front of him, the gray scorpion stares at his eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no such Quaternary note on the scene, there is no whole house, Welch is dead, Naya is dead, you are the only clue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"...well." Klein was silent for a moment and gave a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The note is gone...this is really weird! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t even think about the whereabouts of the Quaternary notes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den’s invisible nod, crossing Klein and speaking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You lock the door Up, now I am going to Welch’s residence, where the 'experts' are waiting for us.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a silent breath, Klein’s heart beats drums, restless . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a heart to refuse, even wants to escape, but believes that with the dream of the car, Dunn Smith must have increased the alert, and the normal person and The strength gap of the extraordinary, forced to do it will not have much success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a pistol on him... It should also be the one that has been practiced many times...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts in the minds of various conflicts, Klein finally chose to recognize the reality:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哎, you can only take a step and see, maybe the special kind in my dream will work again...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Let's go." Dunn's tone did not waver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned and followed two steps and suddenly stopped:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Smith, I... ...I want to go to the bathroom first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came out to go to the bathroom...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dun did not stop, but looked at him deeply: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, Klein, believe me, in the dark, I am far more than You think it's even stronger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark... Klein repeats these words silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not recklessly try to solve the swelling of the lower abdomen, and then washed his face with cold water, so that he calmed down completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change the coat and close the door of his house. Klein gently followed Dunn down the ladder and walked to the door of the apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this calm, Dunn Smith suddenly spoke:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the end of the dream, Why do you want to escape? What are you afraid of?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought as if he was thinking, and he replied:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't remember what I did at Welch's house, and I don't remember whether it caused the death of him and Naya directly. I am afraid that it is really me. I dare not gamble this. It’s better to run away and go to the Southland to start a new life.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If it’s me, I’ll do the same.” Dunn pushed the door of the apartment and let it go in the middle of the night. The cool breeze blows away the sultry inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not afraid of Klein’s escape, he has taken the carriage himself, it is the one that Klein saw in his dream, four wheels, single horse, coachman, car The side of the body is engraved with the police system logo with "double swords crossed and crowned crowns". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein followed and found that there was a thick carpet inside, filled with aromas of tranquility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When sitting down, he is looking for a topic and trying to find out more:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Smith, if, I mean, if the 'experts' confirm that I have really forgotten that part of the memory, and there is no other evidence to prove that I am the injurer, not the victim, is that the end of the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In theory, we will find the note from other sources, and if it exists, it will be discovered. Of course, before this, we will confirm There is no curse on you, there is no evil spirit left behind, there is no corresponding psychological problem, and you can meet the future life safely and healthily." Dunn Smith showed a smile and a strange smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was keenly aware of this and couldn’t help but rushed to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In theory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it’s just theoretical. In this field, it’s always full of distorted, counterintuitive, unbelievable things. Dunn looked at Klein's eyes. "Their continuation, their end, sometimes, is not something we can foresee and control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For example?" Klein was a little scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On almost no one street, the carriage is flying fast, and Dunn takes out the pipe and sniffs the taste:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "When we think things are over and everything is back to normal, it will come again in a frightening, horrifying way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In the past few years, we have dealt with a case of a cult. They organized believers to complete the live sacrifices by suicide and to please the evil spirits. After one of the believers was selected, the instinct to survive defeated stupidity, defeated the stranger, and defeated the psychedelic. Medicine, sneaked to the police station to report the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things were handed over to us for a small task, because the cult has no extraordinary, sacrificed The gods are even more conceived by their leaders. In order to collect money, to enjoy, to destroy humanity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We only used two players, plus the police The cooperation has solved this cult smoothly, and there is no one leaking. And the reporter, we Confirm that he has no taste left by evil spirits, no entanglement of curses, no psychological barriers, no personality problems, no other strange traces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After that, he The profession has a good development, married a good wife, gave birth to a man and a woman, all the shadows seem to be far from him, the past horror and bloody seems to have completely dissipated."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Dunn Smith smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But in March of this year, the financial situation was good, The husband and wife have deep feelings, the child is smart and cute, he is dead, and he has killed himself in the office."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red moonlight outside the window of the carriage On Dunn Smith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, his seemingly self-deprecating smile made Klein feel awkward and could not tell the monks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I smothered myself..." Klein took a breathless breath and seemed to see his own tragic ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you have escaped a catastrophe, you just escaped for a while? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any way to solve it completely? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let yourself be an extraordinary person to fight against? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car was in silence, and Klein’s countless ideas emerged and fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an unspeakable silence, the carriage has been driving for a long time and is driving very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Klein made up his mind, he was going to ask Dunn Smith with a cheeky face. When there was any solution, the carriage stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Smith, Welch's residence is here." The driver's voice came into the ears of both. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
