			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods walk on the ground, not the astral... In the early Quaternary, in the era of the Solomon Empire, there was no boundary between myth and reality, and the gods went straight. On the ground, no need to come? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is similar to the Second Age recorded in the Silver City classics. "Giant Wang Ting" and other places are only separated from the real world by a "gate". I want to pass it, I want to go back, I will go back, people are mixed, chaos and darkness... And, the stars really correspond to the gods... I heard the description of the viscount of Mobate Soroyas, Klein has instant Lenovo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously swept Grosell, because the giant is probably a personal experience of a certain history of the Second Age! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grossel picked up a cup that was more exaggerated than the barrel, sipped the melted snow, and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mobett, isn't this a normal thing? Why are you so serious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't I know why I am so serious." Mobate Solo Yass smiled a little. "Haha, it is normal for us. It may be terrible in their eyes. It is hard to believe. I must use the right one." Expressions to tell, in order to achieve a satisfactory result. Do you remember Longzel's earliest expression when we heard those stories? It seems that I want to swear to the 'Lord of the Storm'."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Klein, Daniz and others did not know what kind of expression and language to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson is biased towards the direction of German Sparo, lowering the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I feel that he is a provocate talent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to control the volume, but the words can actually be heard by every creature present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobette didn't mind laughing twice and continued on the topic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that you don't believe in the fact that the gods are on the ground. It's hard to accept, just like Edwina, oh, I can give two examples, the 'stormy' on Paso Island and The 'deep heavens' of the Amanda Mountains are the gods of the 'master of the storm' and the 'night goddess', the god country on the ground, and the real world is separated from the real world by an illusory 'gate'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa Island? Isn't this the altar of the storm church today? Amanda Mountains... Amanda is quiet in Hermes, which means the Church, the quiet church? When the gods no longer walk on the earth, their kingdoms become the headquarters of their respective churches? Klein intuitively believed that Mobert Soroyas did not lie and made certain judgments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz heard some stunned and fearful, subconsciously want to avoid, can look at the focused captain, thoughtfully German Sparo, and Anderson Hood, who was filled with "sentences" that I was interested in, had to forcibly resist and uneasily search for a more comfortable sitting position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the elf singer Shatas, who was in charge of vigilance, came in and said disdain:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't mention the false god, the power of the storm belongs only to the king of our elves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is clear and feminine, but the tone is full of anger and It’s violent, it seems that I will raise my hands at any time and give Mobert Sorayas an arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I will use pseudo-god to be called." Mobett raised his hand and stroked his sharp, hard black hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiatas retracts his gaze, the shallow believer of "The Lord of the Storm", former Lun soldier Longzel, Edward Road:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longzel raised his head a little, and there was still some lingering in his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not seem to pay attention to the dialogue and disputes just now, pulled up the iron black straight sword inserted beside him, step by step to the cave mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know 'The Queen of Natural Disasters' Gao Shinham?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not sure that Gao Shinam is the slave of the Elf King Sonia Sorem God "Queen of the Scourge", this inquiry is waiting for the Elf singer Shatas to give the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The delicate face of Xia Tasi’s lines is also similar to Longzel’s 恍惚:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I haven't heard of his name for a long time, He is, He is the queen of our elves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mobert and Longzel even I don't know if He has existed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you meet Him, don't you know his situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Xia Tassy’s tone became urgent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Daniz has already looked at German Sparrow, feeling that this madman is so learned, and the elves suspected to belong to ancient times can There are common topics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to be a scholar... I can't see it, I can't see it..." Anderson shook his head as he sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina’s gaze also casts on Klein, and the clear blue eyes of the clear water have a strong sense of knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein calmly responded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I entered a place that belongs to the 'Queen of the Scourge' There are some items in the ruins of Shinam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remains?" Shatas whispered the word, the tone was like what was lost. Important but reluctant things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the situation there, he may not have actually died." Klein asked Sharatha’s eyes and bluntly asked, "You have 'The singer's potion recipe? What can I exchange?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels best when dealing with the extraordinary people of the "storm" approach Frank and straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiatasi thought for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the exchange of an item from the Queen "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only got a glass made of gold, it has been squashed, the surface is engraved with complicated patterns and 'natural disasters, Gossina M's two elf words." Klein did not hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know the cup, that is the queen's favorite cup." Xiatas said with amazement, "transaction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cup is outside." Klein didn't have the idea of ​​going to the fog in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiatas nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When we leave the book, we complete the transaction. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, she closed her hands:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The storm will belong to the elf!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for other people to speak, she curiously asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are still there What did you find? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some murals telling about the battle between the Elf King and the ancient Sun God. Klein glanced at the sorrower Snoman, who was said to believe in the "creator of all things, the omnipotent god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one facing the flame facing the stone wall The middle-aged man finally hoarse and whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, He is not just the sun god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is our Lord, the father of all things, the great source.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Snowman’s voice just fell, Shatas stood up and pointed at him with his arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the elf singer tied the ponytail’s long black hair and spread out, arguing against the nature and above and around, those hair roots The roots are distinctly entwined with silver-white electro-optic light, revealing a strange deep blue color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiatas just had to loosen the bowstring, and suddenly there was a huge gray-blue palm in front of it, which stood in front of the arrow and was not afraid of being pierced. Block it there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the hand of the giant Grosser, one of the characteristics of this race is the exaggerated proportion of hands and feet, almost deformed long, so he just sits, Stretching out his arm stopped Shatas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Snowman doesn't say anything more, you know, Shattrath is an elf who likes to use action instead of language." Grosser of Dervish said, then turned around to see the wizard singer, "Xia Tasi, we are companions, experienced many dangers together, back to the other side can be companions, you can refute Sinuo Man, you can even beat him But can't try to hurt him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the protagonist of travel, full of positive energy...but, what is the difference between him and hurting him? Klein couldn't help but sighed a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiatasi snorted and sat down again. The scene was quiet and quite awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant Grosser looked around with a straight one-eyed look, and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let me talk about my past experiences.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before entering this book, I lived in the 'Giant Wang Ting', the 'declining forest' One of the watchers, where only our king can enter, is said to have buried his father and mother, the source of our giant family. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Giant Wang Ting" is made up of many parts, "Declining Forest" is one of them? Where is the oldest ancestor of the giant family buried? Klein heard Very serious, just want to ask more.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, this is more valuable than the history of the Quaternary, because the hope of Silver City’s hope is "Giant Wang Ting".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, before he spoke, Edwina had asked first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Grossel, what did it look like when you got the book? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grosser raised his hand and rubbed his cheeks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has nothing It is like a blank book waiting to be filled out. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also guessed that Grosseel might be a complete book... Klein took a few seconds and didn't directly inquire about "Giant Wang Ting" The details of the situation, turned to look at Mobert Soloyasd Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know the 'God of God' Amon? "<渎 <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" '渎神者' refers to the entire family of Amon, they are the deadly enemies of our Soloyas, they are said to have a very strong and very The ancestors of terror, even the two adults of Uluos and Medici pay considerable attention and even fear, but no one knows his specific name. "Maubert detailed introduction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulosus, Medici? Well, at the time "real creator" and "redemption rose" were supporting the Solomon Empire. ... Klein’s heart immediately asked, immediately: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you heard of the name of Sasliel? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobett groaned and slowly shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Never heard of . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Dark Angel" Sassil's name disappeared after the Cataclysm? It was buried? Klein determined a fact. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the monk facing the stone wall, Snowman, was dumbfounded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
