			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deep underground building, Klein took the lantern and circled the hall. He carefully examined whether there was another entrance. Of course, he did not dare. Entering the ramp leading to the innermost room, the regrouping snakes were once again blown away by the cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting a positive answer, he took the initiative to retreat to the door and watched the bodyguard Miss Sharon put the explosives in different positions with the three living bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Professional look." Klein whispered a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three living bodies did not respond to him without any doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is also justified. He always uses the spirituality to shield the negative impact of the Aziz copper whistle. Otherwise, he will encounter an unusual enthusiasm. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not intend to bring this ancient and exquisite copper whistle, but in view of the secret of the evil spirits, he had to sacrifice some spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Bodyguard, no, Miss Sharon said she is a blasting expert, really not bragging..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"She was originally engaged in this industry? Or, a sequence in her extraordinary way that she is good at similar fields? According to the information I saw in the Night Squad, this is roughly a sequence of 'criminals', 'Prisoner', 'Warrior' and 'Hunter', Sequence 8 'Security Officer', Sequence 7 'Weapon Master' and 'Shouzhier', oh, the latter has a nickname called 'Detective', belonging to knowledge and The Church of the Wisdom God... I don’t know anything else...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t know which way Sharon will be, it doesn’t look too good. Like, she also showed the ability to direct the living corpse..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's boundless associations, Sharon completed the arrangement, easy Ignited the lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! Why don't you remind me! Klein returned to the world and was shocked. He hurriedly left the hall and entered the corridor outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three living bodies were not in a hurry to follow him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's safe." Sharon suddenly appeared next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein breathed a sigh of relief and asked, "Is there dust coming down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Sharon gave a positive answer with a single word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good." While speaking, Klein took a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶嘶嘶, the sound of the burning lead was introduced into his ear, making him slightly irritated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This emotion is not because he is afraid of the next explosion, but because there is always a boots that have not landed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1." Sharon said with a sudden voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Klein didn't understand what the other person meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth trembled fiercely, the smoke fell from above, and Klein’s ears were in the air, and he could not hear anything else for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he was not a "clown", he had lost his balance and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough and cough! He turned his attention and failed to prepare. He coughed up and saw the boulder and mud falling in the sky, and instantly blocked the entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the remnant of the tremor, Klein clasped the copper whistle given by Mr. Azick and observed its reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has pre-dubbed and got no dangerous results from this trip, here are the humanoid statues of six orthodox gods, even in fog. He did not dare to fully believe in the revelation obtained, and the interpretation itself may be wrong. Therefore, he cautiously judges whether the evil spirits have escaped from the Azick copper whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of the copper whistle is soft and cool, and there has been no abnormal change. Klein is completely at ease, looking to the living corpse next to it, confirming from their eyes. One thing, that is, I am very gray-faced at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is good, very much in line with the explanation I have to make to Mr. Miller Carter afterwards... I didn’t waste my intention to change my clothes... He went to the entrance and confirmed that it was completely blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the big moves, there will be only "apprentice" pathways and extraordinary people like Miss Sharon in the future. She excludes many potential Competitors, no wonder free... Klein stares at the stones and the dirt, and secretly sighs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I can, I have a similar spirit! He smiled silently in his heart, but the surface was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Receiving work." Klein snapped his finger and led three living bodies in a hurry and rushed back to the basement of the house, but Sharon did not know. When has disappeared? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spacious basement, Miller Carter is pacing back and forth with intense anxiety, and looks at the secret door from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the number of detectives of Moriarty and his assistant coming out, he suddenly took a long breath and asked in a hurry: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened inside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein deliberately gasped:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The underground building is too old, too old, not repaired for a long time, we were originally driving the snake, but the action was a little bigger, it caused a dramatic collapse, the whole piece The collapse, but fortunately we approached the door and escaped in time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The storm is on! Is the building so dangerous?" Miller Carter took the boxing Lower left chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, well-preserved ancient buildings are always only a few, and the rest are collapsed in the long river of history." Klein responded, "I Take you in and have a look, confirm the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there still a collapse?" Miller cautiously asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is more sturdy." Klein deliberately took the dust off his body, coughed twice, and then led the employer into a circle. Staying at the entrance that was completely blocked, and the walls near the hall were also collapsed, with stones and dirt behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can use this section." He pointed to the corridor area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Millet for a few seconds, exclaimed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately, I did not rush to let people in Exploring, but looking for you as a professional, otherwise I will carry a few lives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, this time the commission ends here, I will give you the rest of the reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, Miller Carter has taken out the wallet, counted it, and found some thirty A few pounds of cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I have other money, otherwise I will go to the bank." Miller muttered and looked up at Klein. Do you mind collecting gold coins?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't mind any form of money." Klein smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden pound of the Kingdom of Lun, in addition to a large amount of money, can also be gold coins, which is also the guarantee of the face value of banknotes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since the days of Russell the Great, the people of the North Continent have become more and more used to banknotes, and even some Members want to have copper pennies Corresponding banknotes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real golden pound has rarely circulated in the market, only some old-school gentlemen will attach a fixed box to the other end of their pocket watch bracelet. Put some anti-accident gold coins inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is both peace of mind and habit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miller nodded his head and followed a gold bracelet on the garment to pull out a flashing golden box from a pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, he opened the box, took out five gold coins, and together with the previously counted banknotes, handed it to the detective in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t have to avoid anything. After counting it, he suddenly popped up a gold coin and grabbed it with a slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
