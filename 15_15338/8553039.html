			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 Minsk Street, Klein, who was returning home, was not in a hurry to divination on the fog, and looked at the newspaper without doing anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the process, he heard the pray of Unreal cascading and vaguely recognized that this was from a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After experiencing the ravages of the "real creator" slang, my ability in this area seems to have improved a bit... Klein thoughtfully flipped the newspaper, steady Steady half-sitting and lying on the easy chair did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the pointer of the pocket watch is close to 10 o'clock, he puts down the things in his hands and cleans himself up in the bathroom on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the bedroom and pulling the curtains, Klein expertly came to the fog and saw the deep red star symbolizing "justice" expanding and contracting. And bring a resounding cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein spread out of spirituality, touched away, and immediately appeared in front of the "Justice" wearing a light white silk nightdress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her image is still very vague, it seems to be lying on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After honouring the name, Audrey cut into the theme:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ambassador Becker is ' Hunter's Route 6 'conspiracy', an assistant with suspected sequence 5..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After I got the detailed information, I asked someone to ask Mr. A. He agreed to take over the task of assassinating Ambassador Baker Lang, but the condition is 10,000 gold pounds, or the potion formula of one of 'no darkness', 'disaster master', 'prophet' and 'manipulator', which is not It needs to be complete, and some will do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I chose the former, prepaid 2,000 pounds, respected Mr. 'fool', is my decision correct?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10,000 pounds... Klein’s mouth moved and forced himself to turn his mind to something else:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant of sequence 5 should be the intruder of the "divination" approach? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before doing it, expecting the enemy to be wide...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mr. A has that ability, will Will not take money to do nothing...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Disaster Master Festival", "Prophet", "Operator" and "No Darker" juxtaposed, should belong to the sequence 4, this is the threshold of high sequence...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. A is probably one of the twenty-two gods of Aurora, who can be sent to Bakerland. The capital of Mandu, indicating that his status is second only to the top five saints, is the leader of the gods...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aurora" mastery The "secret praying person" approach, which is directly close to the "real creator" road, as a divine, his great probability is the extraordinary person on this sequence chain, based on the status of Beckland, you can initially judge that he has sequence 5 He is a "shepherd". Of course, it may be a lower "bishop", but in other respects, such as the brain, it is more outstanding...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;must I must remind Miss "Justice" that I can't have too much contact with Mr. A. The extraordinary person of the "secret person" approach is not a madman who has already shown an abnormality, or a madman who is deeply hidden. There are almost no exceptions... The sequence of this route 8 "Listeners" but often hear the "real creator" voice...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, only the madman will boldly take the assassination of Ambassador Intis Mission, have the courage to complete...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some "no dark" potions recipes, and corresponding advanced rituals, which can make "justice "Miss saves 10,000 gold pounds...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does Mr. A only have "no darkness", "disaster master sacrifice", "prophet" and "manipulator" formula? Is this a way to interchange with the "secret people" approach in high sequence? There are a lot of things, there are five in this...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Darkness" is the eternal glory, "The Lord of the Disaster" listens to the name like the Lord of the Storm , or the goddess of the night... I have previously judged that the eternal sun, the master of the storm, the god of knowledge and wisdom belong to a similar sequence, so they are hostile to each other. In this way, the "main catastrophe" belongs to the Lord of the Storm. It is the sequence 4 of the "Sailor" approach, and the "Prophet" is the god of knowledge and wisdom...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can all be interchanged with the sequence corresponding to the "real creator", which is a bit interesting...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm... can't formulate "no dark" To Mr. A, part of it is not. The members of the Aurora Club are the kind of madmen who are always looking for opportunities to retaliate against the world and endanger public safety. Strategic things cannot be traded to them... This is not only the bottom line but also the safety of themselves. Aurora will be able to sacrifice the entire city once the time is ripe...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let Miss Justice spend 10,000 pounds, there is her I am going to give it to my deceased, and the rest I can compensate her with knowledge... Klein stretched out his cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not respond to "justice" for the time being, but instead had a paper pen and prepared for divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friend of Maric’s mouth, Klein has no understanding at all, can only judge from the pronoun “her” is a woman, whether to directly divination the other party is reliable, failed It is an inevitable result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Klein can indirectly divince, indirectly divining himself in his own safety, so the success rate will be much higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to whether it will be disturbed, the accuracy of the result is high, because he is not worried about the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a dozen seconds, Klein wrote: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hired Maricina It is risky for a friend to do a three-day bodyguard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting a pen on it, unleashing the spirit, Klein converges, and quickly divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he opened his eyes, he saw the citrine pendant turning clockwise, but the amplitude was very small and the speed was very slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a certain risk, but it is quite low...reliable... Klein gently beheaded and changed to Mr. A. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, he has no direct contact with Mr. A. All his understanding is based on retelling and inference. He wants to confirm whether he is capable and willing to abide by his promise. If it is difficult to get an answer, we can only start from another aspect and indirectly divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a good "diviner", Klein quickly determined the direction, that is, Divination Baker Lang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambassador has a lot of involvement with him, the corresponding information is more detailed, even if the other party is involved in something, Klein is very aware As a divination target, there is no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a while, Klein wrote:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beckron. Jean. Suffering from the deadly threat from Mr. A."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this little divination, he tried to blur the statement as much as possible, without predetermining the result, so as not to fail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Klein saw that the pendulum still turned clockwise, but the speed became faster and the amplitude became larger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that Mr. A will go to complete the task, and there is no small success... Klein slowly sighed and began to respond to the "Justice" prayer: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your decision is no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never take it out yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My sergeant wants to get 1,000 pounds of activity, or before The way, it is best to finish tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will offset the formula of 'Prayer', you don't need to collect information from the secret meeting However, if you can get the corresponding news, I will trade with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the intruder is the extraordinary person of the "divination" approach. After that, Klein’s demand for intelligence about the Secret Society was less urgent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
