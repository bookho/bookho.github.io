			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strongest hunter... Klein was shocked by this title. After careful recall, he found that the other party did not have a bounty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Anderson Hood’s self-report in the dream world is real and reliable, he is more of a treasure hunter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Gilman Sparo has not killed any of the pirate generals, otherwise I am the strongest hunter... Klein did not relax, look Coldly staring at the opposite side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as Anderson Hood is a little abnormal, he will immediately throw out the spell in his hand, anyway, the opening spell is the same, for the current sequence For him, perfusion spirituality can also be carried out simultaneously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the introduction of the "Star Above", Anderson shook his head seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No , not the strongest hunter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, it’s quite modest... Klein felt a sigh in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson smiled and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you're above the star, you still insist, It is best to add a qualifier in front: below the demigod.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the strongest hunter below the demigod. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......I took back the previous sentence... Klein’s mouth moved invisibly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;See "Stars above" no response, Anderson hands down naturally:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sea is dangerous, but also contains a lot of treasures, about this One point, I believe the two are equally clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There were a lot of adventurers, more accurately treasure hunters, coming here, seeking adventures, but most of them were not able to go out alive, huh, I Most of the things that are said, there must be some lucky ones, who can harvest the goods and materials, and can leave smoothly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This treasure hunt is composed of two Collected by treasure hunters with experience in this area, they claim that they have figured out which ruins can not be explored in the first half of the safe channel, which ruins can be tried, which monsters should use for hunting, and which out-of-control singular creatures must be used. Ways to avoid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been very curious about this, I was successfully convinced by them and joined their treasure hunt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "And then?" "On the star will be" Jia De Li Ya slightly dark purple eyelids reflected in the other side of the figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The beginning was very smooth, really smooth, we avoided Dangerous, got a lot of relics from the explorers in front, and hunted some monsters and harvested several pieces of material.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The turning point of everything is in us After discovering a strange temple on the flooded island, there are many well-preserved murals, which the gentleman has seen in the dream world. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to Klein with his chin.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not the point. Klein responded calmly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson shook his head and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of the murals Very sinister, describing a pilgrimage in a separate sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The leader of this team was portrayed as an angel, with silver-to-vest long hair and soft features.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was the first to arrive at the mural before, stretched out my right hand, habitually sketched out the various lines, really, I did not touch, at least 5 cm apart, who knows The angel in the portrait seemed to blink at that moment. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The title of your strongest hunter must be because there are too many things to provoke, and you are forced to come out... Klein has no sympathy and laughs at all. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An angel of silver hair?嘉嘉丽雅反问一句.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but I don't know which angel this is. At least the paintings of the seven churches have not appeared in it. Of course, it may not be true that the mural writers add it at will." Anderson just raised his hand and dropped his hair. However, he found that the man wearing a round neck shirt, a brown jacket, and a cap was staring at himself indifferently. It seemed that he would not hesitate to attack if he had a slight change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time Klein thought about another thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy is Art is very professional, at least the average person can't understand so many religious paintings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jade Liya, who did not get a valid answer, immediately turned his head and looked Klein, with a bit of inquiries in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just listened to Anderson Hood, and Galman Sparo saw the mural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, this member of the organization that has the Lord's gift recognizes which angel it is... "The star above the galactic" Jia Delia inexplicably feels that Gelman Spa Luo may really know the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the "hidden" Ms. at the next Tarot meeting will be able to answer the questions, Klein did not hide, simply said:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The Swallower' Ulous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Swallower" Ulloth? The "destination angel"? The king of angels? Jia Delia's lips snorted unconsciously, and the purple in her eyes seemed to be more obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time she heard the name was at the Tarot meeting, thanks to the advice of Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the first time she knew the existence of the king of angels. I didn’t expect to encounter clues in the real world in a few months! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"‘The Swallower’ Ulothus?” Anderson chewed the name a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t talk anymore, a look I didn’t like to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson sees "the star above" and has no openings, so he laughed and continued to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought it was an illusion at the time, because there was no abnormality after that mural.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next, our team split into two In part, most of them were scared by my description, thinking that the temple should not be explored, and the remaining one third was eager to harvest more treasures and set off to the depths of the temple. We waited all day and waited three times. The alternation between noon and night, but did not wait for them to come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are all excellent treasure hunters, knowing that something must have happened. After confirming a little, I dare not stop, I dare not wait any longer, and immediately leave the temple. Returning by boat on the same route. We have already harvested enough and don't want to take any more risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, you have no plans to save your companions? Well, this kind of ad hoc group of adventurous members, after encountering danger, will definitely only care for themselves and the most familiar friends... According to my experience, your disappearing companions may be eating the fingers of the body... Klein A few words in the abdomen, did not blame Anderson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson sighed again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After leaving the temple, we found ourselves There have been some changes. On the one hand, it has become unlucky. No matter what is done smoothly, even a few mouthfuls of light beer can be found. I don’t know who used the barrel as a toilet and sprinkled urine inside. Well, this It’s not my experience, it’s my companion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“On the other hand, we have gained control over ourselves in our dreams, no longer stupid, Knowing what is wrong but unable to start the action, so some of my companions, about one-third of the initial number, curiously went a long way in the depths of the dream world, huh, they did not come back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly listened to Jia Delia asking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"their real world body What? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Different became a monster, killing a lot of companions and killing most sailors." Anderson made a deep breath. "Although we succeeded in killing the monsters, but because of the lack of enough sailors and a series of unfortunate things, we did not reach the island before the storm, so our ship." After sinking, the harvest is sinking. The rest of the companions are either drowned, or killed by lightning, or swallowed by monsters in the water. I don’t see them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only me, relative to their strength, fortunately, by the waves, they swam to the island and began to try to do canoes. Oh, you saw, my last axe was broken, and Reflected in the dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson’s last sentence was to Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bad luck-hunting treasure hunt... Klein painted a blushing moon in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that Anderson’s description should be true, his experience is not fabricated out of thin air, but he has no hidden things, it is not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, Anderson really went to the depths of the temple, ate the fingers of the body, but thought it was okay, maybe he’s already There are many places explored in the dream world, and there are some obvious pollutions in the dreams of some unknown creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson Hood talked about his own experience, screaming at the "star above" Jia Delia and unknown name: <br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do I have the honor to ride the 'Future Number'?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will pay for the boat. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will let you pay for the price.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaddria again looks sideways To Klein, it seems that he is asking if he wants to agree.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, are you more inclined to promise? You are not going to do the review? I have to go Divination and divination above the fog can give a clear answer. Why are you so confident? "The glimpse of the secret person" to the extraordinary ability of the sequence 5? Klein read this from the "hidden" Jia Delia A little bit of information.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he hesitated to guess, Anderson screamed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I docked The route down is very familiar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can help you avoid the dangers hidden on the safe waterway. You can tell you which ruins can't be explored, so that you can avoid the singing of the mermaid in time!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The song of the mermaid?" Kline’s eyes were almost bright, and it was hard to maintain the image of German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, there is another day of sailing from here, I mean the day outside, bypassing a ruin, turning to..." Anderson suddenly realized that he smiled and closed his mouth, no longer saying more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it, and slammed a gold coin in the face of Anderson, whispering:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anderson Hood has a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continues Repeated seven times, walking the standard process of divination, but actually did not expect the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is testing the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Anderson really has problems, there should be a guilty performance, after all, he can not confirm the level of divination of German Sparrow, can not be sure to interfere with success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;铮! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold coin bounces and falls, and Klein glances at it and puts it directly into his pocket:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go back to the fog and make a confirmation... Klein added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia Delia followed and looked at Anderson, nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promised you Request.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But after this sea area, the items on your body must be divided into half by me. If you have nothing, then I will not do anything. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson was silent for a few seconds and re-appeared with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The deal! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
