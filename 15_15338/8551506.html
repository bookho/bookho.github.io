			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some ways can replace each other after sequence 5? This is not the same as the internal statement of the night! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it impossible to change without choosing a path? It’s not that if you go astray, you will get a weird and weird ability, but it’s definitely half-mad and can’t be promoted anymore? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still some exceptions in it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the diary and his eyes narrowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not doubt that Russell will compose this matter. After all, the surprise between the lines is so real, but he does not think Russell is The news is absolutely correct, and the other party has the possibility of being deceived and misunderstood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter is to be verified... first write it down... Klein reminded himself in his heart and pondered this thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Russell’s description is ok, the water in the sequence is deep... there are a lot of secrets...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; The complete way of mastering the night is "sleeper", the relatively complete one is at least the "collector" of sequence 4, and as a result they can be replaced after sequence 5... other chain of potions The formula is very incomplete, even the initial...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same, the complete way of the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery is the "common person", relatively complete It is a "sneak peek", they can also replace each other at a higher level...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Important...I don’t know which way my "Divination" sequence can be Replace each other? The "apprentices" and "thefters" that the Emperor mentioned at the time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the "Divination" approach is likely to be the ability of each of the first five sequences to provide a capability in sequence 4, then in this step it should be impossible Replaced by other potions... Klein retracted his thoughts and refocused his attention on the diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he found that the two-page diaries seem to be connected together, but the actual content is not continuous, belonging to the records of two periods, which is the later person Linfen copied the mistakes made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On April 9th, the Church of the Eternal Sun, the Church of the Lord of the Storm, the Church of Knowledge and Wisdom, has a bad relationship and mutual hostility, and the Church of the Night Goddess With the Vysak Empire God of War, it is something that can be used and worth considering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On April 13th, I participated in the ancient Organizational gatherings, I don’t think they are members of this organization, it’s really scary.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”The original second slate is in the hands of this organization, I am the first I saw this legendary deity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, it hides unimaginable secrets, hey, maybe one day, I will make a piece It belongs to my slate, no, it is a group, and each piece must contain an ultimate secret!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rub, the emperor, you mean the old organization What is the name! You are so hard for me! Maybe, maybe, Russell is for some purpose, no, or not, write down the name of the organization, even if he is using Chinese... Klein is both itchy and doubtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from this page diary, he finally confirmed that Russell had seen the second slate, and later copied it to make a deck of cards, each A card that corresponds to a path of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, maybe the ultimate secret to the way of God... I don’t know who this twenty-two cards are now in... The organization actually mastered the second slate... Kline thoughts turned and thought a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he quickly converges on various ideas, moves his gaze away from the diary, and looks to "downside," "justice," and "the sun." , smiled and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, you don't have to wait for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is us The privilege." "Inverted people" Alger has already converged with dissatisfaction and humbly responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey thought about it, smiled lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool, you described before The public examination of the officials has been approved by the King and the Prime Minister and will be passed in the upper and lower houses. It is expected to enter the formal implementation stage early next year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the king and the prime minister still have brains." Alger habitually mocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, by the beginning of next year, with Benson’s IQ, with his diligence and hard work, he should be able to reach the passing line in both grammar and accounting...but As long as the upper and lower houses are passed, the newspapers will definitely advertise, and I don’t know how long Benson’s first-mover advantage can last... the sooner the test is better...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hey, in such a short period of time, Benson can no longer beat the elites of college graduates, but they don’t need to win. The positions they want to compete will not be the same. Those guys will only stare in their eyes. The position of the cabinet secretary, the secretary of the Ministry of Finance... only smiles and daggers, and the "fool" who does not speak, Klein has broken his heart for his brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the fool’s first nod, Audrey’s waist is straighter and he smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted Mr. Mr., before you let me confirm, I got the answer. The King has been convinced by the Prime Minister that he will not retaliate against the Fossac Empire on the east coast of Bailang in a short time. I think you should Paying the extra compensation promised before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger seems to be silent for a few seconds after thinking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Miss Justice, thank you very much for your answers, which makes me no longer have to worry about certain things, what additional compensation do you want to receive? I will consider it within reasonable limits."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey has long been ready to laugh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The clue of the psychological alchemy, or the 'reader' potion formula The clues to the main materials, of course, this can wait until the 'Sun' hand over the formula to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Alger Long-winded answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same side as the "upside down man", but the "sun" separated by two positions, Dairik Berg is listening to the fog, abnormally stunned I only know that I can understand almost every word, but I don’t know what it means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the public examination of the selection of officials, the king and the prime minister, the upper house and the lower house, what is the east coast, what the Fossac empire, what psychological alchemy society He didn't understand all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fsac, the root of the giant is a variant of the giant, and what is the relationship with the fallen giant Wang Ting? Dairik looked at "justice" and looked at "downside down" and suddenly felt that he might not be in the same world as the two. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is there somewhere in the cursed land, far from the city of silver, there is more than one city-state, even forming a kingdom? Dairik kept silent and listened quietly, vaguely understanding why the mysterious fools said that the so-called cash compensation given by "justice" may not be received by themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who are so far apart can be drawn together, ignoring the horrible monsters in the darkness of the cursed land. The fools may be gods, ancient gods... He thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey, who had completed all the things she had expected, was going to be a quiet audience, but suddenly thought of another thing, busy and saying:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I recently touched a circle of extraordinary people and learned about a strong man named Mr. A, Mr. Fool, Mr. Sun, Mr. Sun, you know his background and Real identity?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what you are talking about... Dairik keeps silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mr. A? I only know Mr. Z... So close to the code name, is it also the Aurora? Klein made a guess in his heart, but did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must maintain his image and try not to answer without too much confidence. If this situation is faced, the description must be ambiguous, like a God stick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger looked at the fool, seeing that he was calm and not changing, and was difficult to guess the real thoughts, so he thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aurora will always be directed at the Church of the Lord of the Storm, the Church of the Eternal Sun, the Church of Knowledge and Wisdom, so compared to other organizations, these three churches will know more about Aurora, and I will be from them. There are some things out there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without explanation, I know that you are a storm person, of course, maybe two or five... But why is the aurora? Hate objects are just the oldest three churches? Klein smiled and looked calmly at the "downside down man." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
