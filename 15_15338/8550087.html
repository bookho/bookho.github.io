			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few steps forward, Klein saw the divination guest, wearing a black formal suit, holding a gold-plated wooden pole, wearing a half-high hat, gold The short hair is tenaciously exposed from the edge, and the tip of the nose is slightly curved, as if the eagle's mouth is licking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annan’s fiance... The Joyce Mayer who experienced terrible suffering... I saw Klein’s smile in “Dream Divination” Open channel: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Mr. Meyer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon, Morey Mr. Tidy." Joyce took off his hat and bent down. "Thank you for your advice to Anna. She has always praised your magic and can hardly stop talking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Klein laughed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't changed anything, thank you for yourself, no tenacity and a good yearning for you. It is impossible to overcome those who are guilty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being polite, he couldn’t help but vent his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Is this business blown together? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Frankly speaking, I still feel dreamy when I can come back alive, still can't believe that I can survive that time and again." Joe Ess smiled and shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for Klein to say, he curiously asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just saw me, I know who I am, the reason why my nose is too characteristic, or do you admit my visit in advance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have your details For the diviners, this is enough." Klein deliberately vaguely answered and put on the look of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce was shocked, and it took a decade to make a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Mr. Moretti, I want to ask you to divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, he suddenly noticed something:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Klein Moretti claims to be a diviner, not a diviner, a diviner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, let's go to the citrine room." Klein made a gesture of asking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he inexplicably felt that he should wear a black robe, and the words should not be as much as possible to reflect the mystery of the divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the divination room, Joyce Mayer took the initiative to lock the wooden door and observed the surrounding environment, and Klein took the opportunity to quietly pinch his eyebrows. Two times, the spirit is turned on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce sat down, leaned on the cane, pulled the black bow tie, and calmly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moretti, I want to ask you to solve your dreams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dream?" Klein kept everything in the expected state. Confirmed the opposite question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Joyce’s healthy colors have varying degrees of gloom, but they have not yet reached the level of disease, and the mood color is dominated by blue thinking. And it is so dark that it is clearly tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce Zheng’s focus:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“From the nickname to the port of Enmat, I am doing the same dream every night. The dream is full of fear. I know that this may be the shadow left by me. I should go to see a psychiatrist, but I suspect that it is not a normal dream, even a normal dream. Duplicate in the evening, there will definitely be differences in details, and this dream, at least the part I remember, has never changed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the divination Similar dreams belong to the 'revelation' given by the gods.” Klein was half relieved and explained, “Can you describe the dream in detail?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"I dreamed that I fell from the nickname and fell to the ocean. The ocean is dark red, like decaying blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I fell I was dragged by the people on board. I couldn't see how he looked. I only knew that his strength was great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I also pulled One person, trying to avoid the ending of his fall to the sea, this person I know, he is the nickname passenger, Younis King."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of his weight Because of his struggle, I can no longer afford it. I can only let go of my hand and watch him mourn and fall into the sea of ​​blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is here At that time, the one above me also let go of my hand. I waved my arms and wanted to catch something, but I didn’t catch anything. The whole person began to fall quickly.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After that, I will wake up in horror, and my back and forehead are all sweaty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein hand over his forehead, tapping gently Move, think The appearance of the test, followed by the organization of the language: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Meyer, a simple nightmare, a similar nightmare, a continuous nightmare, is a psychological problem, There is a corresponding root cause, and the same nightmare recurring is a reminder of your spirituality and a revelation from the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Joyce revealing The incomprehensible look, he explained in depth: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not doubt that the spirituality of ordinary people will give them a certain reminder."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what happened on the nickname, but I can see that it is a tragedy with blood and iron as the main character, leaving you a deep and deep shadow. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Joyce nod slightly, Klein continues to explain:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On board You must be very scared, you are very scared, and in this extreme emotion, human beings are very likely to lose their observation and ignore many details that should not be ignored, but this does not mean Didn't see them, just ignore them, understand? Ignore them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In your subconscious, in your spirituality, ignored details It still exists. If the things it points to are important enough, then your spirituality will remind you of the way of dreams. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I remembered the feeling of neglect, I found that the note fell in the hands of Riel Bieber, the same case... but I More sensitive, more spiritual, and more occultist knowledge, so I can make a judgment in the first place... Klein pauses for a few seconds, looking at the eyes of Joyce Mayer:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Eunice King, who fell into the bloody ocean because you let go, did you pray for you on the boat, but still can't escape the fate of the fate? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce twitched his body quite unnaturally, and replied a few times before he replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but I don't like him, maybe a few days, maybe a week later, you can see from the newspaper how cruel and hateful the villain he is, he raped and killed at least The three ladies threw a baby into the raging sea and led a group of irrational beasts to slaughter passengers and crew. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is deceitful, strong, evil, I can't and can't stop, it will ruin my life." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't question the thing you did. Klein first gave an attitude and then explained, "Just your dream tells me that you are regretting, regretting that you should not let go." Since you think that killing him is a matter of justice, why do you regret and regret, so that you can dream of letting go? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know..." Joyce confused and shook his head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein both hands Cross, placed in the jaw position, try to resolve: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In conjunction with the description I just made, do you overlook anything in this matter, such as Younis. The things mentioned by Kim, the content of pleading, the gesture of showing, etc., etc., I can't replace your memories, please think hard. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein does not know the specific process, can only be combined with the dream, to give guidance: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether you think that Eunice. Gold is more useful to live, can prove something Can you explain something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce frowned, and said for a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe... I always feel that the conflict on the nickname comes too suddenly, and it develops too fiercely, just like the unnatural desires in everyone’s heart are uncontrollably erupting... this is not normal... very Not normal...maybe, maybe I want to interrogate Younis King and ask him what he was originally doing for the devil's possession..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Listening to Joyce's description as a nightmare, Klein combines dreams, and his thoughts are cheerful and cheerful, with the unique tone of the gods: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, not just like this "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Joyce seemed to be shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein crossed his hands and leaned against his chin, his eyes staring at Joyce’s eyes, his voice low but powerful: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't just think that this thing is not normal, you have seen something that you have neglected, and these neglected things are linked together to deduce a terrible conclusion." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, your spirituality tells you that someone has a big suspicion, that is, the one who dreams of holding you, but who finally let go of his hand You don't doubt him, so you can't see him. He is your companion. He once ruled your life and death, or saved you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Joyceho then leaned against the back of the chair and made a muffled sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is slowly sweating his forehead, his eyes full of confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... I saw..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang, Joyce slammed Let the high back chair sway and almost fall down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Tries..." He uttered a name with all his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a round-faced, awkward, awkward boy, a hero who saved the survivors...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't bother the other, leaned back and waited quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce’s face changed a few times, eventually returning to normal, with a pale normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He showed a bitter smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, thank you for your dreams, maybe me I have to go to the police station."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the wallet and took 1 Sule's banknotes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think money can reflect your value, it can only be given at a price you have determined, this is your reward." Joyce pushed the banknotes Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You give 10 pounds directly, I don’t mind... 1 Sule, you and your fiancee are really like... Klein keeps the stick Grace, nothing was said, with a smile holding down the banknotes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce took a breath, put on a top hat and turned to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he unlocked the lock, he suddenly turned back and said sincerely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Moretti Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master? Klein smirked and watched the other leave the divination room, silently saying a word:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What seems to have happened on the nickname... If the captain Just fine, he can figure out everything from Joyce Mayer’s dream..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
