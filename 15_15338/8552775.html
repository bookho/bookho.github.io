			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost instinct, Klein jerked his knees, swayed back and rolled in the other direction, the direction of the bathroom door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black feather arrow is inserted on the washstand, the arrow is like a bone, with a blue color, it is beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Klein just hesitated, he must not escape this sudden attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning a little, Klein explored his pocket and tried to pull out a few tarot cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he only felt a gust of wind blowing his face, and the corner of his eye saw a black figure moving at high speed, deceiving him in a position beyond ordinary people. Recently, and tightened the instep, from bottom to top, kicked out one leg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein couldn’t help but quit the idea, one elbow, and blocked the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, he only felt that the entire left arm was suddenly numb, and the body was difficult to contain it, like the middle class’s favorite tennis squash. It is the same as football that is currently popular among the bottom workers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great power! Klein was in a tight heart, panicked and adjusted his body in the air, changed his posture, and barely maintained his balance, just like performing acrobatics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Hey, hey... At this time, the bark-colored blowpipe just fell to the floor of the bathroom, and it bounced back and forth from the door to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just wants to stretch his body, stand still, respond to subsequent attacks, and suddenly flashes a picture in his mind:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy in black is faster than he imagined, arriving faster than he expected, swaying his arms and punching his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, Klein’s body reunited and turned a half-turn, like a ball that was constantly falling and being thrown away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put his hand on the head and pressed his hand to the ground, and opened his legs like a scissors, so that the fist of the black man could not hit anything, through The gap broke the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fist that originally targeted the chest was only able to hit his legs after Klein reversed his body, and his legs could be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one push and one leg down, Klein jumped agilely to the other side and finally stood firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still in the future to look at the enemy, the black figure has been sideways, with a strong wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respond quickly! Klein was busy with his arms and was in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the muffled sound of the cockroach, he seemed to be hit by a black bear. It was hard to bear the pounds and vigorously, only to squat back and forth, arms Almost lost consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Klein finally recognized who the attacker was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His skin is black, thin and fine, and his eye sockets are deep. It is the "sentence person" of the Zmanger party, Meurso, who came to Moria in the morning. Detective Meursault! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪! Mersau looked at the fierce light, chasing it up, and waving his arms, or left hook, or right swing, launched a stormy attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s strength is clearly different from the other side, and it is impossible to fight in front of it. With agility and premonition, it has barely escaped this combination of boxing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! Must play my advantage! Similar thoughts flashed, and Klein stopped trying to fight, his body was short, his legs were rolling, and he rolled toward the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's hand was supported, his back was forced, and he continued to roll. He was looking for an opportunity to take out the Tarot cards and the homemade spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merso quickly catches up and kicks his legs alternately, not much slower than the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like a giant bear with agile talent, there is no short board in all aspects, so that the rolling Klein can only avoid the evasion and Parry, simply can not draw a hand to take a curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click, 砰, 砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chair was broken, the table turned over, the coat rack fell, and Klein swung around half a lap, and the situation became more precarious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t go on like this anymore! He continually evades and rolls over and seeks all opportunities to reverse the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his eyes flashed across the coffee table in the living room, and there was an idea in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! With one hand and a jump, Klein endured the pain and rolled to the living room area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Mersor’s muscles suddenly bulged, just like filling up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬! He stepped on the ground and swayed, and the whole person jumped out and shot at Klein's bullets, then pulled out one leg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein barely took a break and was taken out. He slammed the coffee table and smashed the ceramic tea set to the cabinet position and hit the round belly. Pens, standard contracts and various newspapers were scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the detective wearing a black double-breasted long dress was hit and weak, and it was difficult to stand up and it was difficult to roll. Mersor’s eyes were fierce. In the sound of the broken porcelain, the front slipped and the knees came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s eyes turned to look at this scene, and he already held a standard contract in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fled to the living room and continued to roll over to the coffee table, regardless of the hunch, just to get a standard contract, or a newspaper! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that Mersor’s knees were fierce, Klein’s wrist suddenly shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a picture appeared again in his mind, and Mersor’s neck was tilted back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's wrist micro-pressed, shaking out the standard contract in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This contract is like a dart made of stainless steel, shot at the throat of Mersor, the two people are no more than one meter apart, and with The front of the other party is getting closer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White shadows come into view, and Melso instinct leans back and tries to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract was accurately inserted into Mersø’s throat and plunged into his trachea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a little foamy blood flowing out, Mersor fell in front of Klein and his knees were heavy on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Dutch, Dutch..." He took out the blood-stained contract and held his throat tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he couldn’t stop the outflow of blood from his wounds, his eyes gradually diverging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, he twitched a few times and no more movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slowed for a while before he had the power to stand up and hold a few tarot cards between his fingers, guarding against possible counterattacks and other enemies. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After turning on the vision and confirming the death of the other party, Klein looked around and found no other gas field color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down, he saw that the sleeves of the long dress were damaged a lot, and the outer layer of the system was stained with a lot of dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Klein whispered himself: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This can't be reimbursed..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, hahaha, hahaha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed, as if he met What can be a lifetime of life, laughed almost forward and leaned back, laughing, only his laughter echoed throughout the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few dozen seconds later, Klein converges with a smile and his face succumbs to Mersor’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants the dead to speak! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a familiar psychic ritual and self-response, Klein smells the quiet scent and whispers using the technique of "dream divination":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ambassador of the Meurso action."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the blackened eye entered the dream and saw A gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of gray has changed light and shadow, condensing a picture and scene:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In front of Mersau is a middle-aged man without a hat. The neckline and cuffs of his white shirt have a complex, layered, petal-like decoration that looks gorgeous, with a tight black vest and stovepipe trousers. Fancy and exaggerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This middle-aged man has a brown-haired blue eye, and his face is thin and has a taste of scum. He is a very good-looking gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Mersau and said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter what you do, sure Find Ian Wright and try to keep him alive. If you die, please bring it to me within 1 hour, preferably 15 minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Mr. Ambassador." Mersault did not hide his embarrassment, but still lowered his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture is broken, Klein frowned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Ambassador? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter is involved in other countries? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the style of the shirt, the ambassador is probably the ambassador of the Intis Republic to Beckland...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian is just a big boy...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman knows psychic, at least there are people who know how to be psychic...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it and gave the sentence "Dream Divination" again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for Ian Wright's purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the gray fantasy dream, Klein once again saw the middle-aged gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Mersø, and he said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to know why, Just follow my instructions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I give you the potion and give you money so that you can become a behind-the-scenes speaker of the Zmanger Party. It’s not for you to ask questions, it’s for you to do things!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well... you just need to know that Ian Wright might involve a very Important items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the fading of this scene, Klein once again withdrew from the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very important item...I really can’t see it, Ian...what is it...the potion...Merso is extraordinary No wonder his fighting is so strong and terrible. He should be an extraordinary person with expertise in this area... Klein feels exhausted and his own prayers are indeed too consuming his spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
