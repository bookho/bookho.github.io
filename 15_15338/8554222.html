			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Les Circus's small theater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you feel familiar, there is no question for the diviner, Klein pushed the gold-rimmed glasses on the bridge of the nose, and then Rely on, almost whispered a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he closed his eyes for a dozen seconds in the rest, but in fact, he used meditation to quickly fall asleep and get a dream reminder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a relatively bleak room, with only one candle swaying the dim candlelight on the coffee table, and the people sitting around were covered with black hoods The robes are worn with iron masks that cover only the upper half of the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliberately licking the eyebrows, Klein opened his eyes and continued to watch the show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has read the revelation and understands the source of familiarity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture in the dream is The extraordinary party of the "eye of wisdom" held by the old gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pharmacist who is also chubby, and likes to remind others by sarcasm. It is obviously a good-hearted guy, but always gives a kind of guilt. feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will it be the "pharmacist"? Not quite like, when did he know how to train the beast... According to the internal data of the night-timers, the "pharmacist" does not have the same color as the "divination" approach, which can carefully separate the colors of emotions. In color, they don't have to be good at it... Klein's thoughts slowly spread, and did not affect his appreciation of the performance on the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his spiritual vision, the emotional colors of black bears, tigers, and curls are not always stable, and if there is a certain degree of stimulation, it is likely to be on the spot. The outbreak, which indirectly confirmed that the chubby man who had just spoken was not in trouble, he seemed to be able to read the thoughts of the three animals and understand their impulses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his reminder, the animal trainer had a strong anger and his face was gloomy, but after all, he instinctively softened his movements. A lot of caution, a performance ended smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, it was a simple but full of joyful drama, and when it was over, there was a magician to perform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician wore a tuxedo, wearing the same color bow tie, wearing a tall, big hat, just made a mouthful of fire, just let The audience in the venue applauded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very simple skill... The eyesight is very outstanding and Klein, who has seen a lot of magic teaching programs, just took a look and understood the key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the magician performed a classic lockout, picking up a flying pigeon, picking up flowers, playing cards and other shows, Klein thought I can easily see each other's methods, but I suddenly realize that at some point, I have no gain at all, because attention is attracted to the hope of the other side, ignoring the key details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly has no extraordinary ability, but his technique can still pass my eyes. Well, the key is to grasp the attention... the second rule of the magician , fully mobilize the attention of the target to achieve the desired effect? Klein made a speculation in his heart that he didn't know whether it was right or wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is awaiting feedback through "playing". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the performance of the magician was over, and the audience gave warm applause and cheers without hesitation. The atmosphere in the venue reached the afternoon. The highest peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, the third rule, the magician's performance needs to be applauded by the audience?" Klein was half-trubbed and guessed silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At three o'clock, he pulled the neckline of the black double-breasted long dress and got up and left the small theater. He didn't try to touch the chubby suspicion of the suspected pharmacist. Men, just quietly remembering each other's looks - rushing to "talk" may make an overreaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the rail public carriage, Klein returned to Minsk Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage stopped and stopped for a while. The half-closed eyes recalled that the inspiration was just a sudden sigh of sorrow, becoming sober and rational, just like being reacted by a person who forcibly invaded the dream or was directly psychic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he clearly knows that he is not in the real world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a lot of experience, he has nothing to do, looking around for a half circle, and found that the gentleman in the tuxedo wearing a top hat is still looking at the newspaper. Two children, a woman in a light blue dress, screamed at the disobedient gangsters. Next to her, some people were carrying bread and drinking their own tea... everything was no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vision that Klein quietly opened, these passengers did not emit the corresponding gas field color and emotional color! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't have an etheric body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are clearly talking, eating bread, reading newspapers, but there is no trace of alive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this an illusion of illusion, or are they suddenly dying, just in accordance with the inertia of life? Klein struggled to calm down and looked out the window. He saw the carriages and pedestrians on the street coming and going, still in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they don’t have the color of the gas field... As the carriage moves slowly, Klein becomes more and more dignified and doesn’t understand what happened. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down at himself and saw a clear spiritual glory that was very different from the others around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he suddenly heard a roar, not like a roar from humans! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein was busy raising his head and found a black big dog on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's sharp and sharp white teeth are stained with blood rust, it is the demon giant dog, the demon giant dog who committed the bloody case ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black dog quickly inflated into a tall demon with bat-like wings on his back and a horn with a mysterious pattern on his head, which is looking up In the sky, a demon word full of filth is heard:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"堕落!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost at the same time as it is open, Klein has confirmed that it is real, because it has a gas field and emotional color, and has a strong spiritual brilliance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the cry of the demon giant dog, several unreal pedestrians blew up and turned into a black mist, which filled the air and covered the line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Klein can vaguely see that there are a lot of "real people" in the air and around them with the color of the gas field. They use the spiritual brilliance. Extraordinary ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s going on, ordinary people are illusory, extraordinary people are real... This is the night sorcerer, the punisher, they found the demon Giant dogs, with special seals, create a fighting environment that will not disturb the real world? The seal is only for the extraordinary, invalid for ordinary people? So, I just passed by, I was unfortunately pulled in? Klein thoughts turned around and probably guessed his own experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really an inexplicable disaster... He just had a feeling, and suddenly heard a scream, a scream of screaming, a huge scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black gas surrounding the line of sight is suddenly scattered. The demon giant dog falls heavily on the ground, and the body is divided into two pieces vertically, and all the light in the air is Focus on something, make it like a pure moon, shining in a deep and dark environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon giant dog regained his life tenaciously, his body suddenly burst open, fueled by soul and flesh, and burned with light blue and red The sky is burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the flame lost all of its brightness just in mid-air, and was absorbed by the clean and bright things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It disappeared silently, and the demon giant dog simply disappeared completely, and there was no residue left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
