			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who? Why do you know that I purchased the "Sheriff" formula? Hugh's green pupils shrank and looked around, but did not find any suspicious gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Mr. A, the transaction here should be safe and confidential... At the end, Hugh couldn’t help but look at the single sofa, I saw Mr. A, who used the shadow of the hood to cover the five senses, still quietly looked at the crowd, and did not show the slightest difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slammed her hand on her elbow and whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Should I go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls took the note and glanced at it without hesitation: "Go, at least for now. There is Mr. A watching, no one dares to do anything to you, you can take the opportunity to figure out what the other party's purpose is, maybe you can really get the potion material you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It makes sense..." Hugh is a very mobile person. He immediately bowed his head to the waiter and followed him to the study room, wearing a robes with a hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hat can cover my entire face, I can't see the road ahead... I wear a hood, open the door, and aim at the desk. Sitting behind a man wearing a black tuxedo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man wears a golden mask on his face, revealing his eyes, nostrils, mouth and cheeks, making it impossible to imagine what he was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light brown eyelids behind the golden mask turned, the man pointed to the chair opposite the desk:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is deliberately dull, but no extra special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh back to the door of the study, chest up, do not lose the momentum to sit in the desired position, the opening asked:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have the main material of the 'Sheriff'' potion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mask man laughs a bit:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the eyes of the feared worm and the right palm of the silver war bear, I have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In fact, the formula of the 'Sheriff' of the 'Sheriff' is that I am looking for someone to sell it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder... Although he is often laughed at by his friends, he has no brains. But in the circle of extraordinary people, living in the gangs and poor people in the Eastern District, she is not a completely reckless person, she has a beast-like instinct for danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked in a deep voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you doing this?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Screening the right helper." The mask man chuckled. "With your financial situation, it is difficult to get enough money for these two extraordinary materials in the short term. Of course, You can go to other extraordinary parties to resell the recipe, but believe me, this will bring you unnecessary danger, our circles do not necessarily overlap, but I am not alone."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughing and frowning: "Since you have a huge organization, a 'Sheriff' or even an 'arbitrator' potion formula, why should I still ask for help?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are many things, we don't want to come out ourselves. There are many reasons, but I don't have to tell you, and every arbitrator who walks on the path of extraordinary people on his own." 'There are more or less aristocratic relationships behind, which is what we need.” The mask man probably explained two sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that he doesn’t know my origins, not even my reputation in the Eastern District... Hugh is a little relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mask man continues to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should be a commissioner outside the party, I Will give you some tasks, pay your corresponding rewards, if you feel dangerous, you can refuse, this is fair, free trade, until you have enough money, you can come to me to buy materials."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...the troubles that are worrying about the financial situation are stunned and held for 9 seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" As long as I have the right to refuse the task, I can consider it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No problem.” The mask man laughed. “We can now agree on where and how to meet in the future. In order to reassure you, the dominance is given to you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Good." Although Hugh is still full of fog, I don't understand why the other party is looking for something to do, but still agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least she does not currently see a significant hazard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the day on Sunday, Klein is busy buying a chair to buy a tea set. Sewing the clothes, costing a total of 6 pounds and 9 sules, leaving the living room, dining room and itself restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a loss. I hope that the police department will finally be able to compensate my loss from the legacy of Mersor. Oh, hope is not big, at most." Klein put the invoice receipts neatly and waited for a useful opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, purely from the perspective of income, he actually earned a lot, and Mercer’s extraordinary characteristics are worth at least 300 pounds, or even more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premise of all this is that Klein can reach the circle of extraordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, wear a solid color sweater and a gray-blue worker's coat, put on a cap, and Klein goes out again, transfers twice, and comes to Bakerland. Iron Gate Street in the bridge area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a few steps, he saw the "Brave Bar" and saw the seemingly heavy black wooden door and a strong double arm that was close to two meters. Chinese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong man looked at Klein and did not stop him from pushing the door, but his throat squirmed as he heard the cheers and cheers inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time period is the peak of the bar business. After Klein has not entered, he feels the heat wave coming from the face and smells strong aroma of malt. I heard a noisy and noisy voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, he saw two tables in the center of the bar, one playing a dog-catching game, and one having two boxers waiting patiently. Prepare for the upcoming battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine was mixed with sweat. Klein lifted the gold-rimmed glasses, pinched his nose, and protected his belongings while struggling to the bar. position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before waiting for the bartender to speak, he pre-emptively said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A cup of Southwell beer."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the best beer produced by the Kingdom of Lun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"5pence." The bartender replied familiarly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took out a coin and counted 5 pence to the other party, in exchange for a large wooden cup filled with golden liquor, the aroma of the beer was tempting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In front of it, a lot of beer can't even be called wine, it can only be considered a drink." The bartender laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein picked up a drink and felt refreshed and refreshed. First, it was bitter and fragrant, then the taste of malt rushed out, and the mouth was a bit sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the cup and look at the delicate white foam. He took the opportunity to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is Spas Kanlining?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender stopped the action of wiping the cup and looked up at him for a few seconds, pointing to the side: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" in the billiard room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein in the spirit of not wasting, on the end The cup went to the third table outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just tapped it and let the door open and open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men holding the billiards bar stopped and looked at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking for Casper. Kanlining." In the silent atmosphere, Klein was busy adding, "The old man introduced it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, the half-bone man with a big nose and a linen shirt said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a mouth-turning, huge scar on his face, stretching from the right corner of his eye to the right side of his mouth. His nose is a typical rosacea, almost completely red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the cup and walked in slowly, only to see Cannin's billiard opponents put down the pole, left the room, and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspars Kanlinen limped around and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A large-powered special revolver and fifty bullets." Klein drank again. beer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"3 pounds 10 sul." Casper quoted the price, "This is definitely more expensive than the regular weapons store, it contains the risks I bear." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Complete." Klein took out five five-pound denominations that had been prepared from his trouser pocket and counted four for each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspars checked the truth and nodded and nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You It’s more refreshing than your appearance, wait for me for five minutes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He placed the banknote on the billiard table, leaned on the pole, and turned to the door. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving Casper, Klein turned back and looked at the current popular billiards and found that it was very consistent with the mature snooker on the planet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be you, Russell the Great...He almost shook his head and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Casper pushed in and held a kraft-wrapped item and two 5-Suller notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took over the money and things, and opened it on the spot, with a silver-white revolver with a long barrel in his eyes, and its handshake seemed to be Made of walnut wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there are fifty round yellow bullets neatly placed in the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein tried the empty gun, loaded five rounds of bullets, stuffed the revolver into the underarm bag that had been bought, and then picked up the remaining Bullets, looking up at Casper, discretion: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I want to hire a powerful bodyguard, who should I look for?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very powerful, beyond the limits of humanity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspars licked his own redness The big nose, the eyes become cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully examined Klein for two minutes, creating a sense of oppression in a silent manner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I can help you ask, but there is no guarantee that someone will pick up this task."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I know more than one extraordinary person... Klein Squatting corner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what the result is, please allow me to express my gratitude in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Caspars put away the banknotes on the billiard table and walked out of the room again. After ten minutes, he returned to the room, and Klein had bored the big cup of Nanwell beer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He wants to see you and then make a decision." Casper said in a deep voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, change to me, but also to assess the difficulty of the task." Klein smiled dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed behind the tough Casper, walking through the side of the crowded boxing ring and entering the bar's kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspars suddenly stepped, tapping a door, and when allowed, led Klein to push the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
