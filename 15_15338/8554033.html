			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey is about to apply for a separate exchange, and suddenly found one thing, that is, the "world" at the bottom of the bronze long table is completely absent. Showing an interest in “playing the law”, there is no impulse to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally mastered the "playing the law", or privately asked Mr. "fool"? Audrey sighed, still cautiously requesting a separate communication environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she looked at Fols and said with words and pronunciation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Our attitude toward the potion should not be mastered, but digested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The key to digestion is to play, the key to play is the name of the potion." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Folth asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She made a little thought and added a question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How should I play it?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey recalled the posture and examples of the original "Foolish Man", repeating the series of descriptions of castles, guards, invitations, and pretend, the last road :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, the purpose of the play is to reconcile the body, mind, and spirit, to circumvent the stubborn resistance of the remnant spirit of the potion, to crush and digest it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a novelist, Foers has a strong imagination. At the same time that "justice" is finished, she has already sketched out the corresponding The picture and the scene basically understand what the other party wants to express. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original spirit of eliminating the residual spirit in the potion Influence, reduce the risk of losing control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The more I think, the more I think this is possible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fols's doubts gradually diminished, and the feeling of surprise slowly filled her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, she confirmed that she had asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what Mr. Fools taught. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, if it is not Mr. Fool, we may have lost control. If we exist, we prove that 'playing law' is effective." "Justice" Audrey praised the road sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call...Fuls quietly vomited and felt that his future was full of hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the adventure described in various novels? It feels so good! However, it is still not possible to care about it. Mr. "The Fool" may be a kind of evil god who is not well-intentioned and deeply hidden... Firth reminded himself in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, she began to think about the more important question, that is, how to play the "apprentice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of literal meaning, "apprentice" means that all aspects of skills are not yet mature, still have to be taught, still have to concentrate on learning? Can't be reluctant, can't be proud, know how small is your own strength? Fulth quickly spread his mind and did not realize that the environment for separate communication had been suspended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "Sun" Dairik looked around in silence and bit his teeth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I want to know which seven gods in your mouth are the same, and the general situation of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally couldn’t help but ask This is a problem that has been in my heart for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......I know this! "Justice" Audrey was almost unable to react, but she quickly figured out what the "sun" was asking, so she raised her right hand slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, "downside down" and "world" also indicate that they can answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What are they doing?" Fols looked blankly and tried to remember what had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the moment, she remembered the problem of the "sun" and chewed out the meaning implied in the other's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No? He didn't even know the Seven Gods? Where did he come from? Fols looked at Mr. Sun, who was just a teenager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the North Continent, no one knows the seven orthodox gods except the children who are not sensible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who is struggling to survive is no exception! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For them, the occasional free food distributed by the church is so tempting, and the poor house opened is a candle in despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of the colonies of the South China? However, why did he ask such a simple question here, it is absolutely unnecessary! Find a church directly, ask the pastor or priest to preach, you can figure out the relevant content! Where does the "Sun" live? Really a freak! While thinking about it, he looked at the left and right, but found that Miss Justice, Mr. and Mr. World were not surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "fool" in the fog, Klein saw three people answering, laughing and laughing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Sun, who do you want to trade with?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you willing to pay?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik licked his lips and thought for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I trade with each of them individually." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to get the most comprehensive information... Dairik has matured in the harsh environment of Silver City during the previous patrols and removals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remuneration is a question that can be asked, I can answer That kind of."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I promised that I am very interested in Silver City." "Justice" Audrey laughed without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver City? What is this place? How did I not hear it being said? Fols looked around and felt that they couldn’t understand what they were saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey took a look at her and explained it with kindness:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Sun' Mr. is not on the North and South continents, nor on an island on the ocean. Silver City is outside our cognitive or exploratory limits.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deceptive? Fols had a thought of subconsciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the performance of the "Sun" and the idea that everyone can't unite to deceive me, let her quickly accept Audrey's explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This secret meeting is more inconceivable than I thought... "Mr. Fool" is more powerful than I thought... Fuls secretly exhaled and sighed a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey blurs out her current thinking, and wants to show off the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qi Lingus, Intis Ambassador Becker and "Scammers" Lalus is all because of the death of Tarot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, if these three things are known by Fols, she can immediately think that Audrey is "justice", confidential, confidential... ...very hard to keep secret! "Justice" Audrey suddenly took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I don’t know about Silver City, I don’t know what to ask. Foers did not mix into the next transaction and chose to watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "upside down" and "world" successively agreed to the "Sun" Dairik's request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happiest thing is Klein. For him, this means that the harvest has changed from one to three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The content of the individual communication, "fool" can be heard! And Klein obviously does not intend to shield himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ‘Sun’ classmate is really simple!” He laughed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the many information related to the Seven Gods, "justice", "upside down people" and "world" can only "write" the key points they think. After a while, they respectively passed their respective descriptions to the "sun." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric quickly browsed through and stared at a few lines of words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Beyond the Lord who created everything, the oldest gods are the eternal sun, the master of the storm, the god of knowledge and wisdom, and their church is the oldest church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Why haven't I heard of these... these gods, I have never heard of it... I feel that there are some important things hidden inside... "The Sun" Dairik knows that the Tarot party has limited time. So I hurriedly finished reading, and I plan to go back and pray to Mr. Fool, asking him to help wake up memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question that was raised was "Justice" Audrey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the serial murder case, she was very interested in the sequence of "Devil", so she imitated Mr. "World" and asked the corresponding question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick replied skillfully and added an additional sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"in the corresponding sequence 7, the extraordinary of the 'abyssian' route can effectively interfere with divination and psychic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the "devil" is terrible, I don't know my sequence 7 "Psychologist" will bring qualitative change... or, to sequence 6? Audrey was quite a bit afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question comes from the "hanging man" Alger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have been thinking for a long time, looking at the "sun", screaming: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to know the creation myth of Silver City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly tighter Deric relaxed a little bit:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The omnipotent God created everything and entered the sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Giant King Olmer, 'dream dragon' Angel Weed, Elf King Sonia Sorem, vampire ancestor Lilith, Demon King Fabti, the ancestors of the ancestors, Gregory Carrie, the alien king Kwashtun, the king of the devil, Fregra, It divides the authority left by the Lord and becomes the master of the sky, the earth and the ocean, and dominates the reality, the spiritual world and the astrology, and rules the gods of all races, the true gods, the ancient gods."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fregra? Klein, who was listening, suddenly noticed a familiar word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever he gets promoted, the state is unstable, or when he comes into contact with the residual effects of the Antignus family notes, the ear will always reverberate without knowing Where is the illusory proverb:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honakis...Fregra...Honakis...Fregra...Honakis... Fregra..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein knew very early that Hornachs refers to the mountain with the remains of the night country, but it is still unclear about Fregra What does this word mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, for the first time, he heard "Fregra" in other populations! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of the Wolf, an ancient god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How, why did He involve the Hornacs Mountains? Klein kept his posture and listened quietly to the "sun". Dairik continued to tell: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have fallen in each other's battles, After the creation of the Lord of All, the omnipotent God awakened, he was deprived of his authority."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The front is the creation myth, the latter is the silver city real "History of the past"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More to say, can only stop in time, turn to thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of the devil wolfa, in the second era, the dark ages long before the Cataclysm, has withdrawn from the stage of history? Klein thought about it while manipulating the "world" question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
