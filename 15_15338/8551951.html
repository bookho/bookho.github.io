			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhous? The criminal who cheated and cheated? He had a certain connection with Hood Eugen of the "Psychological Alchemy Club"... Klein heard a sigh, and immediately remembered the meaning of the name Lalhous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fraudster who has swept away more than 10,000 gold pounds of wealth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a clue to 10 pounds, helping to get a mobile vault that can earn 100 pounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the dross that deceives the innocent women's body and feelings! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he actually knows Hood Eugen and visits the madhouse three times, does this indicate that he is in contact with the extraordinary circle, or that he is extraordinary By? Thinking of this, Klein suddenly remembered the name of a potion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serial of the "The Thief" route 8, "Scammer"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such extraordinary people tend to defraud others! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very likely! Klein nodded thoughtfully, controlling facial expressions and body language, so he asked casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last time Mr. Lalhous When is Hood Eugen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the beginning of July, the specific day, I have to go back to the madhouse to look at the corresponding registration form to know. Dast Gudrian sighed for a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of July, when Lalus’s scam was not bankrupt, he had not escaped from Tingen... Klein turned and asked:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hood. Does Eugen usually mention this gentleman's business?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you It should be known that a 'psychologist' of Sequence 7 cannot disclose certain things because of carelessness. Every sentence they say is repeatedly considered in the heart, unless they have other purposes, it is difficult. I heard the secrets from their mouths, and I also took advantage of Hood Eugen’s madness to get the formula of 'Readers'. Right, do you confirm the authenticity of the formula?” Dust will The pride of the sequence itself is well hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true, when you need to be promoted Relifully follow it to deploy the potion. If the 'Psychological Alchemy Club' fails to provide the materials, we can help, um, what is your recent state?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Not bad, in addition to the anxiety of Hood Eugen, the whole person has been relaxed, no longer signs of personality splitting, in this matter, you really helped me a lot." Ster is sincerely convinced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein made a humble expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what I should do." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go back to the topic just now, since you said that the 'psychologist' will repeatedly consider every word that will be spoken, not easily revealing the secret, that Hu Why did De Eugen tell you that El is Llanus? Is he suggesting something, or is it reminding you of something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dast I stayed for a long time and frowned. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really weird, I didn't even pay attention to it... but apart from that, Hood Eugen Didn't mention it... Is his purpose, if he has any problems, can I tell the name of Langus to the senior officials in the meeting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The reality is also a bit of a problem. After I notified Hood Eugen's madness, I did have a contact person. I will tell you in detail about every detail, including Langer." The name of the squad, the high-level no longer responded, just like the stone was thrown into the sea. Does this mean what they guessed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very reasonable speculation." Klein took out the demon bomb and stuffed it into the runner, trying to aim at the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe a temptation makes him choose to take risks." Klein made a guess. At the same time, he also regrets that Hood Eugen really became a mental patient, which has caused many clues to break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哎, even if it’s a dead person, it’s better than a madman. I can use the psychic way to let him go. What should a madman do? Ah, Ms. Dai Li has tried to wake up my lost memories with psychicism. The theory used also comes from the “Psychological Alchemy”... This shows that for the living, you can also use the “Psychic Ritual” to create spiritual and spiritual direct The situation of communication... In this state, I don’t know if Hood Eugen is still crazy...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I am not professional enough in this field, I guess No way to do it... Well, I first summoned the messenger and wrote a letter asking Ms. Dai Li to see what skills she could offer. If she thought she could only do it, then tell the captain and ask him to take a telegram to the Bakerland Parish. Requesting assistance...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am definitely not trying to learn the skills and rituals of trying to summon the messenger, just around the corner...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein has flashed an idea in his mind and gradually got the idea to solve the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dast is quite agree with his guess:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Greed is always ignorant Even if you know clearly that the abyss is in front, try to get close to the boundary and pry into it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is called crazy temptation on the edge of death... Klein's belly One sentence, I thought about it: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After you go back to the madhouse, try to treat Hood Eugen, try to keep him awake for a while, give hints." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, don't hide your worries and anxiety, and contact the people of the 'Psychological Alchemy Association' to urge them to solve the problem of Hood Eugen, this is The most normal and most reasonable response."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dast Zheng focuses on:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I work hard Go and do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't say more, and asked again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a recent abnormality in Hood Eugen's body? Some parts grow fine scales."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Half-madness", "true madness", and "out of control" are different degrees of description when the extraordinary person actually has problems. Light is just a change of three views, like changing a person, but being able to think rationally and act normally is a "semi-mad". Those who are more serious will lose their logic, chaos and madness, and are difficult to communicate. They are called "true crazy" and cannot The type of salvation is that both the body and the mind become monsters, completely "out of control." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at some point, if you don’t solve the problem in time, you may be out of control if you are crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, in order not to expose the informants lurking inside the "Psychological Alchemy Club," Dunn told the night-timers not to immediately control Hood Eugen, and Take a monitoring investigation to prevent accidents, but if the other party shows signs of losing control, it must be dealt with decisively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dast shakes his head and smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, at this point you can rest assured, I am also very afraid that Hood Eugen is out of control and will not miss any details. After all, I have six days a week in the madhouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talked again After the sentence, he left the shooting range ten minutes apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein endured a strong sleep, took the public carriage and went all the way back to Daffodil Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the door and saw his sister sitting on the sofa in the living room, neither reading a book nor smashing the parts and machinery, just looking at the front and losing one The appearance of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flicking your teeth and turning on your vision, Klein wondered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melissa , what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa regained her gaze, rubbed her lower lip, and looked at the kitchen with her voice coming out. She said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bella has been recommending her family-specific The breakfast practice was very delicious, and I promised to let her try it this morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Klein vaguely had a bad feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put the leftovers of last night and cook them, then add water and bread..." Melissa repeated and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, this is the standard dark cuisine... Klein stretched his forehead:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "So?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't waste food..." Melissa bit her lip and nodded seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister, I feel that you are skeptical of life... Klein cleared his throat, suppressed the smile, and asked: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Banson?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is in the bathroom." Melissa finally got rid of her confusion and her eyes reappeared. Glorious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sound of pumping in the washroom on the first floor, Benson took the newspaper and opened the door:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Klein, are you coming for a breakfast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I have already eaten." Klein resolutely shook his head. And fortunately, Dast arrived for this morning, otherwise he would not let Rosanne bring breakfast in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a pity, otherwise you will change your opinion on my cooking skills, full of confidence." Benson laughed at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Melissa noticed one thing, turning her eyes and looking at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You are coming back very late today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister, innocent, lively, don't always worry... your status is good ! Klein suddenly smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a good news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You passed the police The assessment of the hall can get an extra salary?" Melissa almost did not think about anything and asked for an exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson also smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Klein took the hat and stood on the edge of the living room, and said with a funny voice, "How does this surprise me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he added a cough and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, my weekly salary has doubled."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He concealed the newly added weekly salary of 4 pounds, intending to accumulate a small vault for the future, after all, can not rely solely on the money in the unregistered account, and doubled enough to scare Go to his brother and sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"6 pounds?" Melissa blurted out and was surprised and shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really need to change jobs." Benson touched his hairline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the information provided by Klein, his self-study during this time was quite hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Klein opens, Melissa reveals a happy look:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Come, except for normal expenses, you will be able to accumulate enough wealth in two or three years to meet the minimum standard for a gentleman to marry. Well, the standard is told by Elizabeth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Klein laughed and said with a smile. "This is a long time later. Shouldn't we celebrate now? I announced that starting today, our staple food will become white bread, waiting for me to finish." During this time, we went to different restaurants to taste the food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
