			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "King of the North" Yurisian’s screams quickly turned into awkwardness, and the outside of the cave immediately slid up and made people unable to see the 5 meters. snowstorm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistling whirlwind is full of dense "goose feathers", which fills up every inch of space. At the same time, an ice-blue halo expands rapidly, sticking to it. The ground extends outwards, and wherever it passes, everything that comes into contact with it becomes an ice sculpture from the bottom up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision and hearing were affected by the blizzard. Klein’s mind showed a corresponding picture. He was busy with his knees, his ankles forced, and he straightened up. Let the ice blue aura pass from below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While not knowing how to fight, Mobert Soroyasde found the ice blue ring, the other party is very close to him, so he can't do it. The action of jumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, his shoulders were caught and lifted, and there was a violent hurricane in the soles of the feet. The combination of the two made him passively high. Leap, avoiding the end of the ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobett looked over his head and saw the Shatas with his face in the face. The Elf singer was forbidden to fly because of this. Drive the wind and slowly glide forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson, Edwina, Snowman and Longzer also responded in a timely manner, jumping in time, not stunned to escape the attack, only There is a giant Grosser just raised the broadsword, broke free from the snow, and encountered an ice blue aura, a moment of dodge, was touched by the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick layer of ice crystals surged instantly, and Grosser stood in the same place, as if freezing the body of a thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exaggerated blizzard obscures the sight of the extraordinary, allowing them to completely lose their lock on the frosty dragon, Yurisian, and can only passively guard against attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the monk who has not yet landed, Snoman once again opened his arms and solemnly said in ancient Hermes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God said, invalid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plundering blizzard calmed down a lot, whether it was a violent hurricane, or The densely packed goose feathers have weakened or disappeared by nearly half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vagueness, Shattrath saw a huge ugly face like a lizard, and the broken long arrow was partially inserted into the other side. Forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frost Dragon Yuris Ann has just taken the opportunity to bring the distance between the two sides closer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chartas did not panic, the wind suddenly turned, pushing her and Mobetter to flutter, while at the same time, her white lips because of the cold Open and sing in the old elf language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reef must be torn by the waves;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The big tree will be knocked down by the storm;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mountain will be destroyed by the thunder..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Because every word in Elvish is rich in meaning, the sentences are very short, so these lyrics don't cost much time for Xia Tasi, and from the first word, from the beautiful and strong melody. At first, the wind in the snowstorm has changed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistling wind confuses and collapses in all directions. The huge body of the "King of the North" Yurisian reappears in the eyes of Klein and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Xiatash sang the third word, "Retribution Knight" Longzel has launched the right palm, using the ancient Hermes language to open the way :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captivity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, I am about to collide with Shatas and Mobe The special frost dragon solidified in the same place, surrounded by layers of transparent walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Longzeer whispered, the newly-arrived "Iceberg Lieutenant" Edwina’s light blue eyes suddenly turned black, inside There is a viscous liquid that is suspected to be all the evil thoughts in the heart of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her right palm is just a light grip, "The King of the North" Yurisian is standing up and smashing the effect of imprisonment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frosty blue eyes of this frosty dragon are full of sorrow and pain, and seem to be immersed in the sudden burst of madness and tyranny! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if this is its usual state, it is completely detonated and makes it very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, it is a dragon with poor emotional control! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Ulysian’s short pause, Anderson Hood’s hand condensed a blazing flame rifle, then a front stalk It went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did not go to see the results, the flames of the strongest hunters came out and condensed into liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blazing flame lance has accurately hit the half of the frosty dragon's mouth, and quickly melted away the thick ice crystal piece, which has been spared. Captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urisian screamed again, and his legs slammed, his body slammed out, slammed against the ground and rushed to Anderson at a terrible speed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only the bug that keeps you from being hurt! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stab! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow was separated and the ground was plowed out into a deep and wide gully that spread all the way to Anderson's whereabouts and extended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! The frosty dragon, with a terrible inertia, hit a rock covered with thick ice, hitting it with a broken shell and cracking the inner layer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this hits Anderson, the strongest hunter must become a bologna, even if it is only wiped, he is likely to die on the spot. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, somewhere in the ravine, Anderson’s original position, but there is a black hole that goes straight down, just enough for people to drill in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand was placed in the mouth of the cave, and the strongest hunter with the messy hair jumped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He throws out the flame rifle and does not sneak away, but uses the extraordinary ability to melt the snow under the feet, burn the soil, and make it silent. A cave that was not too deep, and then the whole person fell in and smashed down, perfectly avoiding the impact of the "King of the North." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, a clear and pure light column fell, hitting Grosser, and quickly melting the ice crystals on his surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monk Snoman used the method of attack to remove the restrictions encountered by the Giant Guardian! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dawn of the glory broke out, Grosell held a giant sword, strode to the face of the Frost Dragon, launched a crazy embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grossel’s height is only one meter shorter than the Ulysian Anfi, and the power is equally exaggerated, in a continuous collision with the opponent’s front paws, though There was a noticeable shaking and retreat, but it will soon recover, again crossing the front and entangled the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Giant Guardian blocking the front, others have made their own responses more calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monk Snoman kept his arms open, and there was a halo-like halo around his body. This aura flew out and warmed up every time. A companion, who brought a strong courage and was manipulated with precision, avoided the "King of the North"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not far from him, Xia Tower The silk is swelled, the bowstrings are pulled apart, and one arrow that seems to be condensed by the wind blade or lightning is shot. Because the target is very large, she can hit every arrow, and it is almost in the same position, that is frost. The "shoulder" of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maubert Soloyas with Grosell, sometimes stealing the idea that the "King of the North" is about to be put into practice Let it appear a short sluggishness, sometimes trying to steal, but in the case of a small number of times, it has not been successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson took the dark dagger and carefully wandered to the side, as if to attack a particular part, "Retribution Knight" Longzel waved iron straight The sword, using the ban and imprisonment judgments, assisted Grosell and the Frost Dragon to fight. If there was no such thing as him, even if the giant was the "guardian", he would have been drawn out and suffered a trampling or vomiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at Edwina and raised her finger: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stealth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He doesn't know if the other person can simulate this ability. If not, he has to consider another method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina did not ask why, the light blue and clear eyes immediately reflected the figure of German Sparrow, immediately lost color, changed Be transparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s body fades and disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirmed the state, Klein rushed to the dragon and the giant who were in fierce confrontation, one rolled, and came to the left of the "King of the North" Leg position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, while paying attention to avoiding the pedaling of Yurisian’s battle, he used the “line of the spirit” that had been opened for a long time to spread the spiritual manipulation. Unreal black thin lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he followed, rolling, sometimes leaping, looking for safe space under and around the Frost Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver lightning arrow and a pure blue wind blade fall in a small area, crushing the ice crystal piece, tearing the tough The skin, very quickly, the location of the "right shoulder" of the Frost Dragon is a pale blue, and the swing of the front paw has an insignificant delay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The disciplinary knight" Longzel was keenly aware of this, one side shunned the ice blue breath, pointing to the position, using the ancient Hermes The language is solemnly pronounced: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗, Yurisian "right The place where the shoulders are filled with pale blue blood is instantly dry and torn to see translucent bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina also took out a palm-sized brass mirror that reflected the part of Ulysses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She explored her right palm and even grabbed the mirror directly, pinched the image inside, and then pulled it hard and pulled it out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wound of Urisian became exaggerated and spread, as if he was about to lose a front paw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It screams and screams, and lifts up the body, and people stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brilliance of the pale blue near white rushed out of the dragon body, and within a hundred meters of the range, the temperature dropped sharply, accompanied by the feeling of being difficult to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, all the extraordinary people seem to have suffered a long-lasting ice, the body is cold to the extreme, it becomes very stiff, and it is difficult to contain it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer is like this, Mobett is like this, Edwina is like this, Klein is like this, Grosell, Anderson and Longzer The same is true. Only the bitter monks who have experienced numerous chills and tempering can still act reluctantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept his arms open, closed his eyes halfway, and solemnly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God loves the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun penetrates the snow and the light comes in, and the warmth begins to melt the feeling of freezing,<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysian took a flight from Grosser, and the giant guardian was sunken in the chest and was not hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has not taken care of other people for the time being, aiming at the monk Snoman, colliding with the past at high speed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snowman no one protects... I have to leave my 5 meter range... Klein’s body is still looking at this scene with a bit of rigidity, and has turned and rushed into Cave, pray to yourself, then go to the fog and use the impulse of "Poseidon Scepter" to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a red fireball grabbed the frosty dragon and fell to the monk, and then blasted unceremoniously, and the other He flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comes from the strongest hunter Anderson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
