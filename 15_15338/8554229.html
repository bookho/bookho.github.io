			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wheel was pressed against the track, the horse dragged the car, heavy but steady, and quickly left the street where nothing happened. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s expression grips the cane normally, until the rail public carriage has passed two stations, before getting off the train, bypassing the big circle, slowing down to the devil The place where the giant dog was killed was returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not looking for the extraordinary characteristics of the other party’s analysis. The top power of the church cannot be ignorant of this matter. It must have been taken away. He is not under investigation. The source of the contempt, this has been so long, the carriages on the streets, people coming and going, where will leave any clues, even if divination, certainly can not get the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s goal is to glimpse the characteristics of the seal that creates a strange battle environment from the subtle details that surround the street, for the future. Encounter to do some preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the "magician" plays... He walks under the gray sky and walks on the edge of the street separated by gas lamps, silently sighing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he had to wait for two stops to get off and return around the distance was to worry about the official extraordinary who had secretly cleaned the battlefield at the time. Can you not When you meet, try not to meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dressed decent, holding a cane, Klein hanging with a gold bracelet at the placket for a certain period of time, finally returned to the "Devil's Dog Death Scene", but There is no corresponding trace residue on the street, and the pedestrians who traveled and apparently did not know that there had been a fierce battle in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That seal is amazing, it is more powerful than large-scale hypnosis." Klein opened his mind and made his footsteps even more Slow, like a gentleman who goes out on an outing instead of doing things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After such a circle turned down, he spent more than half an hour, but he did not get any gains, but the target block was no abnormality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Klein’s inspiration is still aware of something, that is, scope and boundaries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I enter the neighborhood and leave from the other direction, I have a subtle illusory feeling that seems to move from one world to another, that is to say The seal can affect at least one block. The ceiling is unclear. Well, it can be confirmed that it only works for the extraordinary." Kline stood outside the target street, thoughtfully. The location was down, and then I returned again, looking for a café with a good grade, and ordered a cup of Nanweier coffee and sat down by the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is drinking the fragrant liquid while looking at the increasingly busy streets outside, seeing the precipitation over time, is there anything else here? Variety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, what he expected did not happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he is not completely unproductive, at least he confirmed that "the magician does not do unprepared performances" is indeed one of the rules played. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that the subtle precipitation of the body has a very light sway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the evening, Klein stopped observing and re-taken the rail public carriage back to Minsk Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the gas lamps on both sides of the road have all been lit, with a blue fire light illuminating the slightly wet concrete floor and one The leaves of the leaves are yellow and withered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a cane and walked outside the home of Jurgen’s lawyer and strolled to the house on the 15th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking around, he suddenly thought of one thing, that is, the ingredients in the home have been used up, so it is impossible to make dinner like this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount, is it going to the butcher shop, the fruit shop, or the first to find a restaurant to fill the stomach? Klein hesitated, and finally decided to steal a lazy tonight, eat ready-made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although many dishes in this world are quite simple to make and very fast, there will be no one-hour cooking and five minutes of dining, but no matter what, Still need some work, but also have to brush the dishes and wash the knife and fork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again passed the home of Jurgen’s lawyer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgen stood behind the open bulging window and looked at the Moriati detective with a "confusing" expression, raising the volume:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moriarty, you, I mean, have you forgotten to bring the key? Or, is the key gone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you want to say it again? Klein replied: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgen is very serious The place is down:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it still to my house?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for dinner The sky is all black and then go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein hesitated for a second and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is my pleasure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he entered the door, the black cat Brody was washing his paws in the corner, and Jurgen didn’t have much chilling. Entered the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait until Klein hangs his coat and hat, puts a black cane, walks into the restaurant step by step, has food on the table, has black steak and the same color Mashed potatoes and other food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not surprised by this, Mr. Jurgen’s grandmother, Mrs. Doris’s cooking style after she was old, is not good, but Sufficiently delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a chef... Klein sits opposite Jürgen and smiles coldly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You are preparing to dine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, before eating, I used to look at the scenery outside, let my thoughts have no boundaries. Spread." Jurgen laid the napkin and picked up the knife and fork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is looking around in a circle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Doris?"尔 <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulgen sighed and replied solemnly: "The weather is getting colder and colder, the old problems in her lungs have appeared again, and I have to go to the hospital for a while. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May God bless her." Klein was not skillful in drawing the triangular emblem of the Church of the Steam and Mechanical God on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he cut the steak and forked it for the entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he suddenly thought of a question and was busy saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is your prepared dinner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, it will be done a few minutes ago." Jurgen replied succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the craftsmanship of Mrs. Doris’s wife, then this sale... Klein’s mouth twitched, holding back the fear of her heart, still biting the silver The small piece of meat on the fork slowly chewed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brows wrinkled a little, eventually forcibly swallowed the food, and his face squeezed a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you ready two in advance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One is ready to take to the hospital and give it to my grandmother." The root looked up at Klein and didn't think there was anything wrong with it. "Wait for another one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It turned out to be the case. For the sake of courtesy, Klein secretly took a breath and solved the food in front of him with a battle-like posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished eating, there was still half a minute left in Jürgen. The senior affairs lawyer temporarily put down the knife and fork, picked up the tall glass next to him, and drank. Red wine, asked without any expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Which dish do you like the most?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I know that there is still a big gap between me and my grandmother’s craft, but it should not be too exaggerated.”<br <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Lawyer, I suspect that you have problems with your facial dysfunction and your taste... Can you not know yourself correctly? Klein smiled and moved his head and left: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White bread is not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "That was bought by Dodge Bakery." Jurgen re-embeded his head and solved the remaining food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After drinking the remaining red wine, he thought:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moriya Detective, I want to entrust one thing, very simple commission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Klein kept drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mashed potato was too salty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My grandmother is in the hospital recently. I sometimes don't come back for the case, so Brody will have to go hungry." Jurgen To the black cat, "I want to ask you to feed Brody when I don't come back, clean up its toilet, play with it for a while, it likes others to scratch its chin, um, every night at ten o'clock. If my family doesn't have lights and it's dark, you can come in, every time 2 Soules, until my grandma goes home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sees the old-fashioned total It was a serious and serious expression on the face of Jurgen’s lawyer, so he went up and down: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Simple task, relatively rich reward, I There is no reason to refuse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, he looked at the black cat Brody and smiled at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black cat Brody slowly turned his body and took his back to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s smile could not help but stiffen his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full-fledged Klein left the Jürgen home Walk slowly back to the house you rented on the street where the night has completely fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the people who have finished their work have arrived home, are enjoying their own dinner, there are few people on the road, and there are not many carriages, quite quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the gas streetlight, Klein is slower and slower to go back without any urgent desire, the same is true of the black shadow beside his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing by Samuel’s house, he passed through the convex window and saw the light inside, the figure back and forth, the voice of conversation and laughter looming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 15th Minsk Street next door, it was dark and silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sighed, speeded up, took out the key, and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering, he habitually read the letter box and found that he was lying inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who sent it? Klein took out the letter and glanced at the light of the street light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No postage stamps...Written like Essinger Stanton...He nodded slightly, entered the house and closed the door, opened the light and broke the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the letter, Grand Detective Essinger said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... I am happy to tell you The murderer has been found and killed on the spot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The police department believes that our work can be at least half the reward, and I should be able to send it to me this week." At that time, I will invite you and other friends to come and share the bounty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
