			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2, Narcissus Street, Klein nodded to Azke, walked quickly to the front of the house, took out the key and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa, who has already returned home, heard the sound of the lock cylinder turning and was busy from the kitchen to the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Klein, her eyes open brightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I bought good food, There are chicken, potatoes, onions, meat fish, turnips and peas. I also bought a small jar of honey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister, you also adapt to occasional small "Luxury"? Klein smiled low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today you have to prepare dinner, don't worry about my one, I have something to go out, maybe I have to come back in the early morning. Well, help Azick faculty, the faculty of the history department of Hoy University."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he turned and pointed to the door waiting carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa’s lips were stretched twice, and she shouted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein bids farewell to his sister, walks out the door, goes to the rental carriage hired by Azke, and spends two hours and forty minutes to reach Ramd. Small town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point close to nine o'clock, the sky is all black, only relying on the blushing moon and trivial stars that occasionally penetrate the clouds to illuminate the place without gas lamps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After telling the driver to wait in the town, Klein led Azick and embarked on the road to the abandoned castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking around, he found that Azick was getting faster and faster, and he had to trod to keep up. At the end, he even became Azick. Leading the way ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wanted to say something, but when he saw the silent face and tight lips, he would wisely swallow the words back into his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this speed, the two didn’t take long to get to the abandoned castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It almost turned into ruins. It stretched its body around in the darkness, leaving the spires to the sky, desolate, wild, gloomy, and bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick stared at the abandoned old castle and slowed down his footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped there, his eyes faint and sometimes blurred, as if he had been succumbing to dreams and reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he snorted and raised his hand to hold his forehead, and the muscles on his face were twisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Azick, you, what's wrong with you?" Klein started his vision and cautiously asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As early as on the way to the rental carriage back to the Narcissus Street, he made a quick divination by playing the coin, predicting the return to Ramd’s action. There is almost no danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he believes that divination is not a panacea, always beware of his own interpretation errors, or the organization of divination statements, plus Azick teachers are mysterious The strong strong, no one knows what he used to be. He doesn't know what happens when he encounters stimuli. Cautiousness, alertness and worry become the normal mood of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick did not answer immediately, his expression painfully stepped forward, loosening his hand on his forehead, pointing to the front, using a nightmare-like tone :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen this castle in my dreams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At that time, It is also very complete, with a strong façade and a towering spire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember there was a stable, there was a well, where the soldiers’ barracks, There was a field open up to grow potatoes and sweet potatoes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember there was a driving range, my child, he was a boy, At the age of seven or eight, I like to drag a broad sword higher than him and run around, saying that I want to be a knight in the future..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My wife always complains that the castle is too dark, she likes the sun, she likes the warmth...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who is examining the color of the opponent's gas field, hears the scalp numb, but is slightly moved, just like experiencing a strange story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ancient castle really has a relationship with Mr. Azko... Is he really the first Baron Ramde, who lived a thousand, three hundred years of extraordinary biological? Is he a human or a evil spirit? No, there are evils running under the sun, and the evil spirits who have had contact with the night... Klein can't control his own thoughts, let them collide with each other and stimulate more ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Azk stopped the proverb and stepped into the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked all the way to the inside, without Klein pointing, he found the organ well and opened the secret door to the basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding the cane, Klein stepped behind the other two steps, down the ladder, and back to the place where the coffin was placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the lid of the coffin has been closed, and the feeling of warmth and purity has dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coffin was covered... It should be Frye’s work, this is the professional ethics of the “collector”... Kline nodded thoughtfully, Azick faculty members who looked at the emotional confusion with the spirits walked to the front of the coffin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick reached out to push the coffin cover and launched a gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at the white bones inside without a head, suddenly bursting into a sad, painful whine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬, Azk stepped back heavily, slamming down before Klein reacted, slipping against the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rubbed his face with his palm, and sat so decadently, the surrounding environment became darker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein grabbed the first two steps, and he was about to reach out, but he shrank back and didn’t bother. At this moment, his inspiration told him that Mr. Azko is now terrible, terrible, and the basement has become cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein moves silently, close to the ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes in Mr. Azick’s character, but he is afraid that the other person will lose control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such uneasiness, he waited for a few minutes and finally saw Azick put his hands down and slowly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Azick seems to have changed a bit... This is the answer that inspiration gives me... but in the spirit, his gas color does not have Obvious changes, emotions are just as low, lost and painful as before. Klein quickly judged and felt that Azick teachers became deeper and more majestic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think of some things, but only a small part." Azick said in a moodless tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he looked around for a circle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I’ve noticed here that you are The power of uncoordinated fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Klein first glimpsed and immediately asked, "Can you trace its source?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behind-the-scenes black hand living in the red chimney house, in addition to secretly making a coincidence, also came to Ramd Castle and took the black full-body armor knight. Head? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does he want to do? What is his real purpose? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been too long, but I want to give it a try." Azick’s low voice seemed to contain the volcano that was about to erupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you try?" Klein asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick walked back in front of the coffin and stared at the white bones inside:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" He took my child's skull and I wanted to find him with the help of blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your child? Mr. Azick, do you confirm that the black knight is your child? You are really old-fashioned... Is it really memorable once in a while? And this is the price of getting a long life? Klein secretly took a breath and had the illusion of touching mythological creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Azke stretched out his right hand and scratched his index finger with a sharp sharp thumb nail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A drop of red blood falls and is accurately contaminated with white bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It quickly soaks in and instantly turns the whole bones into blood red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow! Wow! Wow! Klein suddenly heard the baby crying, feeling who was staring at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jerked out the revolver, pointed to the rear, and then slowly turned, but his eyes were empty and nothing existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no ladder to the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow! Wow~! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby’s cry screamed into Klein’s ear, and he once again looked at the coffin position and saw that there were sheets or invisible or distorted faces. The black fog rises and turns into a strange door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusory door is wide open, and a pale arm stretches out, but in front of Azick, they all transpire into black fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the crack in the door, Klein saw a white skull that was randomly discarded under a dark brown tree and rotted in the wind. powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numerous pale arms were pinched off by the suddenly closed doors and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Klein heard a long sigh, from Mr. Azick’s sigh, piercing a heavy historical sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this sigh, the black mist disappeared abruptly, the baby’s crying came to an abrupt end, and everything was restored to its original state, but it was a lot colder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gritted his teeth, shuddered, looking into the coffin, and saw the red bones turned back to white, crystal white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I didn't find him..." Azke, who was facing Klein, said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he reached out and closed the coffin cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not found normal, can be found is a surprise." Klein comforted the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, I have been disappointed many times... He silently added in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick looked at the coffin in front of him and turned slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will continue Keep track of it and hope to get your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, this is exactly what I want to do." Kline resisted the "red chimney" The matter now tells Azick the impulse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it’s useless to say it, you can only rely on himself to confirm the goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this also solved his big problem, that is, how to introduce the value of the night after finding the red chimney house - he does not believe in relying on You can kill such a mysterious and terrible behind-the-scenes hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, he can seek the help of Mr. Azick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick opened his mouth and finally said nothing, just sighed and silently walked up the ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the basement, close the secret door, the two along the road of weeds and thorns, no one spoke to the abandoned castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rich night, Azke suddenly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
