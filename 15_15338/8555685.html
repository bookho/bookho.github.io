			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glasshouse outside the window reflects the light of the pale sun, and the brightly colored roses are so conspicuous even in the thin mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Nigan in the bedroom seems to have recovered from his father and his elders when he was young, riding horses on vast land, driving the hounds, and chasing the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he climbed to the top and seemed to be very quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, his mind suddenly swelled for a moment, only to feel that kind of pleasure, the kind of refreshing and violently bursting open, constantly bursting, no limit, no end Blast again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Nigan trembled with his waist, and his brain lost his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart beats unbearably and violently, like a steam boiler with a pressure limit that is not known, it will blow up anytime, anywhere, and it will be hot anytime, anywhere. The mist is sprayed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the ordinary person or the extraordinary person whose physical quality is not strong, there must have been a myocardial infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, and a fall on the spot, but the Duke of Nigan is still quite Come over, just the eyes are missing, the mouth is flowing, and the whole body is weakly turned to the lying mistress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "windmer" and the duke secretary who were on both sides of the room were aware of the spiritual anomaly and mysterious taste at the same time. The former was wrapped up in a violent The wind, rolling him into the wall, slammed a big hole and entered the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary went straight to the mysterious source - the attic of this house! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, he does not evade, but the vases and other things used in the corridor seem to have their own lives, avoiding them with clever gestures. He. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he jumped up the stairs and ran to the attic, the wooden floor seemed to be helping him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just three or four seconds, this gentle, handsome-looking blond young man has entered the attic and saw a figure sitting on an old chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body is covered with thick black liquid, just like the collection of all ugly desires and violent emotions in the depths of the human heart, that is willing to sell and hang himself The greed of the rope, that is the hunger that the same kind does not want to let go, it is an unrestricted lust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the devil walking on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slim secretary’s expression did not change, nor did he directly attack, but looked at the other side, reaching back and politely closing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wooden door of the attic was closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a feeling of being completely blocked in the whole room, and it seemed that it was not easy to break, and it was inseparable from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, the concept of "closing the door and sealing the room" seems to have been falsified into "sealing this place, isolating inside and outside"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aspirations of the Apostles" moved, his body swelled and grew, and he grew a pair of huge bat wings that braved the light blue flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fireball with a strong sulphur taste formed, and it rushed to the blond secretary of the Duke of Nigan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary stretched out the left palm of the white glove, slammed it tightly and turned the wrist halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! Bang! Bang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireballs no longer follow the principle of straight line or parabola, slamming toward the surrounding, confusing even the irregular movement of tiny particles proposed by a botanist Some of them slammed into the wall, some hit the ceiling, some fell to the side of the weak secretary, and some went back, almost hurting the "desire apostle" himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire loft was a mess, with shattered and burnt marks everywhere, and even the house shook twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Desire Apostles" was not frustrated by the failure of the previous attempt, nor was it because the other party's emotionally stable desire was restrained, unable to control, unable to catalyze and panic, and his brown eyes burst into a magma-like flaming leaping, condensing into a blonde secretary. In the mouth, a word of devilish words full of filth and stench is spit out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, the secretary wearing the gold-rimmed glasses shrank and spread his left fist, aiming at the "desire apostle" with his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, his figure has been divided, one is a gentle and gentle, his thin body, one is the "desire" black liquid cover shadow, both It alternates quickly and sometimes overlaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of filth echoed in the attic, and the secretary snorted. Going back two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of differentiation disappeared, and his face suddenly showed large chunks of rust red marks on his face, just like turning into a Iron man in wet places for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough and cough! He coughed hard and spit out a mass of blood that was lumpy and covered with rust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traces of his body are slowly shaking off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough and cough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Desire Apostle" is also coughing, but also coughs out the blood condensed into pieces of rust, covering the thick black liquid of his body is thin a lot of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that half of the effect of his filthy language was transferred to himself by the secretary of the Duke of Nigan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Winners" helped the Duke of Nigan, and kicked the beautiful mistress to the other side, in case the other party was an associate of the attacker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he did not help Mr. Secretary is because he is very clear that his duty is only one, that is to protect the Duke of Nigan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a similar situation, you must beware of more than one enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Duke of Nigan swollen a little, but his strength is quite strong, he still has weak hands and feet, his body is empty, his spirit is sluggish, and there is no way to use himself. Extraordinary ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gestured to the "Wind" to take the conch necklace around his neck and put the item to his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Nigan took a breath and blew it out, blowing into the small conch full of strange patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low tide swells and rushes toward the Holy Wind Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the speed of the Archbishop, he will be able to arrive soon!" "The Winder" first comforted, then carried the Duke of Nigan, and walked Near the window, leaping down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to meet with the Duke Guard outside, and there are two or three low-ranking extraordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Nigan wheezed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catch, be sure to seize the live, or , Spirit...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to know who it is! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time was the assassination of the pirate general Qilingus, this time is a stranger of the sequence 5, the Duke of Nigan asked himself who he had not recently To this endless degree of development, it is particularly irritating and extraordinarily resentful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to find behind the scenes, use all resources to tear the other side!<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven or eight seconds, most of the Duke Guards came over and surrounded Pallas Nigan and the "Winners" in the middle of the garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just wait here and guard against the enemy." "The Winder" issued the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the normal process, he should protect the Duke from leaving the assassination scene as soon as possible and rush to the holy wind cathedral, but he is not sure if there is anything else The enemies are afraid of ambushes on the road, and most importantly, he is worried that the "God of the Gods" Ais Snake, who is helping, will be staggered and thus fall into a more dangerous situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One second, two seconds, three seconds... The time is running out, the house is shaking, and the battle inside seems to have entered a white-hot stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why didn't the Archbishop have yet to come?" asked the Duke of Nigan, who was breathing calmly, in a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the speed of the other party, it should arrive soon, but in the direction of the Holy Wind Cathedral, there is no sign that the mist is blown away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Winner" is highly alert and hesitates to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, maybe Archbishop, Archbishop..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say the possibility that the Archbishop was not in the Holy Wind Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the beautiful mistress of the Duke of Nigan went to the window of the bedroom on the second floor, his eyes revealing a beautiful smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she jumped down and deliberately slammed her head on the concrete floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sound of the tooth, the beautiful head cracked a small gap, and the blood flowed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She twitched for a few laps and eventually her face up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes completely lost focus, and the solidified expression was full of madness and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, many members of the Duke Guard are unable to contain the fear of containment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the Duke of Nigan himself, under the premise that the Archbishop Sneek has not arrived, has the feeling that his emotions are almost collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go! Leave here!" The weak one shouted instinctively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Winner" is rejoicing that he has not had a soft heart, and kicked the mistress first, otherwise the Duke may be killed on the spot. At this time, listen. To the command of fear, his heart suddenly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the attic, the "desire apostle" in the fierce battle liquefied, turned into a lot of black shadows, full of chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After avoiding the attack of the blonde secretary, he re-aggregated in the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he looked at the enemy, raised his right arm, and his mouth twitched slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" The blonde secretary’s eyes turned red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the "desire apostle" clenched his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the luxury house, the horror of the Duke of Nigan blasted openly, slamming his brain, drilling into the blood vessels, covering the nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard something broken and felt that his head was warm. At the same time, several members of the Duke Guard became panicked and raised their special revolvers or rifles in the middle of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Wind" took the first step, hugged the Duke of Nigan, and fell to the ground, and the invisible wind of sharp pieces like a knife was created from the air, cut off The throats of the guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
