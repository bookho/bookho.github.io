			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real psychic... Klein silently read this description, did not speak again, followed Dunn Smith and walked down the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welch’s residence in Tingen is a single-family house with a garden. Outside the hollow iron gate is a road that allows four carriages to travel at the same time. There is a street lamp every 50 meters on both sides of the road. They are different from what Klein had seen in the past. They belong to the gas lamp. The height of the column is slightly equal to that of an adult man, which is convenient for lighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black metal clings to the glass, encircles the grid, and casts a classical "artwork" like a lantern, dancing cold and warm. Shadows and light are in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road covered with faint yellow, Klein and Dunn Smith entered the place where Welch rented through the half-covered iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main entrance is the access road for two carriages, paved with cement and directly connected to the two-storey house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a garden on the left and a lawn on the right. The faint floral and refreshing flavors are intertwined to make you feel refreshed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as he stepped in, Klein suddenly stood cold and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels in the garden, in the shadow of the lawn, on the top of the house, behind the swing, in a dim corner, with a pair of eyes watching himself ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one here, Klein seems to be in a lively street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This weird contrast, this weird feeling makes him taut and has a cold from the tail vertebrae. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a problem!" He couldn't help but remind Dunn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den’s expression walked sideways and replied plainly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See "The Night of the Night" is saying this, Klein endured the creepy feeling of being tracked, being snooped, and being looked at but not finding the target. Step by step to the main entrance of the single-family house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a long time, I will be nervous... When Dunn reached for the door, Klein quickly looked back and the flowers swayed with the wind, no figure . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in, gentlemen." A slightly ethereal voice came out of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den twisted his hand and pushed the door in, saying to the woman sitting on the sofa:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Dai Li, is there a result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living room chandelier is not lit, and a leather sofa made of two main patterns is made of marble. coffee table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a candle burning on the coffee table, but the flames are bright blue, and the living room, dining room and kitchen in the semi-open layout are covered. The layers are swaying in strange colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lady sitting in the middle of the couch. She is wearing a hooded black robe, smeared with blue eyeshadow and blush, wrapped around the wrist outside. A silver chain with a white crystal pendant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing her first sight, Klein has an inexplicable feeling: dressed as a real psychic...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this playing itself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave with a fascinating "Psychic" Dai Li, sweeping Klein with a flash of green eyes, looking to Dunn Smith:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original spirits have disappeared, including Welch and Naya, and the little guys here don't know anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ling? Psychic...just those who are not seeing are the spirits? There are so many spirits? Klein took off his hat and put it on his chest, whispering slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good evening, madam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn Smith sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really tricky..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Delly, this is Klein Moretti, you can try to find something from him." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Psychic" Dai Li’s gaze immediately turned to Klein, she pointed to the vice-person single sofa:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please sit down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Klein nodded, a few steps past, honestly sitting down, a heart Unconsciously raised it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s life or death, it’s a smooth ride, or a secret exposure, just look at the next development! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most powerless thing is that it lacks something that can be relied upon, and can only hope for special...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a bad feeling... Klein thought bitterly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Dunn sitting on the double sofa opposite him, "Psychic" Dai Li took two thumb-sized pockets from the pocket inside her waist. Glass bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her green eyes smile and look at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need a little help, After all, you are not an enemy, you can't treat it directly and rudely. It will make you feel uncomfortable, feel pain, and even leave serious sequelae. I will give you some scent, give you enough gentleness and lubrication, let you Let go of yourself a little bit and really immerse yourself in that feeling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I not listen to this... Klein is amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite Dunn smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be surprised, and the Church of the Lord of the Storm The guys are different. For us, the ladies can also verbally slap men. You should be able to understand that your mother is a godly devout believer, and you and your brother have also read the church's Sunday school." Br><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I understand, I just didn’t expect it, so...” Klein gestured, didn’t find a suitable adjective, and almost blurted out the correspondence of “old driver”. translation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den's mouth is upturned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, Dai Li rarely does this, She just wants to calm and relax in this way. She likes the body more than the man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that I am a pervert." The psychic" Dai Li smiled and interjected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened one of the small bottles and sprinkled a few drops into the brilliant blue candle flame:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Night vanilla, deep sleep flower, chamomile mixed distillation and extracted pure dew, I call it 'Amanda', the quiet meaning of Hermes, very good."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, the candlelight swayed a few times, and the drops of pure dew quickly evaporated and filled the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quiet and charming scent has penetrated Kline’s nose, his mood is no longer tight, his mind is quickly peaceful, as if looking down in the dead of night dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This bottle is called 'Eye of the Eyes', using the bark and leaves of the dragon and poplar trees for seven days, boiling for three times, soaking in the lang Made with Qi wine, of course, there will be a few spells in the middle..." The amber liquid is accompanied by the description of the "Psychic" Dai Li, dripping on the bright blue candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smelled the scent of the wine, the ethereal scent of the wine, he saw the candle burning so badly, saw Dai Li’s blue eyeshadow and blush flashing strangely The sheen and even the ghosting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a good helper for psychic, and it is also a charming flower..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Dai Li's statement, Klein only heard her voice coming from all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bewildered to look around, Klein found that everything was shaking, it was blurry, like a layer of thick fog, even with himself The body is shaking, followed by blurring, followed by the floating, followed by the loss of weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red is more red, blue is more blue, black is darker, color is mixed like impressionist oil painting, blurred and dreamy, and the whistling around is shattered Come, like an invisible person who is innumerable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is similar to what I used to do when I was a 'transfer ceremony', but there was no such thing as crazy, people want to explode..." Klein looked at it and wondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, his gaze was attracted by a pair of crystal-like eyes like emeralds, Dai Li wearing a black robe sitting on a fuzzy "sofa" The eyes were very focused on Klein's head, and the voice smiled softly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Formally know, I, 'Psychic' Dai Li." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...I can still think calmly and rationally...just like the 'transportation ceremony' and the "party"... Klein’s thoughts, deliberate performance Out of the state: "Hello..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The human mind is very broad, hiding a lot of secrets, see, the sea, we can understand Only the islands exposed to the sea, but in fact, under the surface of the sea, the island has a larger part, but in fact, in addition to the island, there is a whole piece of sea, and there is an infinite sky symbolizing the spiritual world... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the spirit of the body, you not only know the islands that are exposed to the sea, but also the islands." In the part of the sea, I know the whole piece of the sea...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where it exists, it will leave traces, the memory of the island surface can be erased, but under the sea The part and the whole piece of the sea must have its corresponding corresponding projections..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily induced over and over again, the surrounding winds and shadows changed. A similar shape, like Klein's soul, is fully revealed here, waiting for him to find and discover.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein calmly looks, from time to time" Twisting in the sea, the final tone is eloquently answered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No... I can’t remember... I forgot..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just showed the pain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delly tried to induce again, but the sober Klein was unaffected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, come over here, go back." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Go back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ethereal voice, Dai Li disappeared. The wind and shadow began to calm down, the quiet taste and the faint scent of the wine reappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the colors returned to normal, the feeling of blurry confusion is no longer present, gram Ryan’s body trembled and he recovered his weight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his eyes and found that it was still the bright blue candle in front of him. Dunne Smith, who is comfortable sitting, is wearing a cloaked black robe with a "Psychic" Dai Li.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you use the psychological alchemy? The theory of helping evil madmen? Dunn frowned slightly and looked at Dai Li.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dai Li put away the two small bottles and calmly answered:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel quite right, at least in line with what I have seen in contact with..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t wait for Dunn to speak again, She spread the door: #br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was a tricky guy, and there was no trace left. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this sentence, Klein was a long sigh of relief, so he asked ignorantly:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is the end of the game? What happened just now? I feel like I have slept..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is even a pass?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Drills" with "transportation ceremony"!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Think of it." Dunn interrupted his words and looked at the "Psychic" Dai Lidao. "Have you checked the bodies of Welch and Naya?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The body can tell us more than you think, but unfortunately, Welch and Naya are indeed suicidal, can only say that affecting them The power is daunting, and there is no trace left. Da Li stood up and reached for the candle. "I have to rest." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
