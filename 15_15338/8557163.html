			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunting them?" Daniz subconsciously asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I really understood the meaning of German Sparrow, he instantly became excited, changed his sitting position, pressed the voice of the voice:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do I need to cooperate with?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a qualified part-time pirate, he is tolerant and compassionate Good words such as benevolence have nothing to do with it. Since I almost died in the hands of "Steel" Maviti and have a chance to retaliate back, I am definitely not willing to miss it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks he can survive in the pirate industry, relying on the accurate grasp of the situation, knowing when to resist, when to fight, when Pretend that you can't see the enemy, when can you clear the old account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, is the opportunity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German. Sparrow is how powerful this madman is, Daniz still dare not make accurate judgments, but solves the fall within ten seconds from the other side. Bishop Miller sees that it is not too difficult to deal with the "steel" Maviti. Even if he encounters "the blood will be" Seignor, there is no hope of not winning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this refers to the one-on-one situation, but the pirates never talk about the knighthood... Daniz thought deeply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s body leans forward slightly, with the elbows on the knees and the palms of the hands:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I have said it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? what? Daniz felt that he often couldn't keep up with the ideas of German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, he can only comfort himself, normal people and lunatics are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the other person not talking again, he thought about it and finally remembered what he should do:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Write "Blood will" and what his pirate group has done! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well...German Spalo is sure to know how many things they have looted... Daniz quickly determined the idea and found the room The paper pen and the brush brush have written a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, he was extravagantly killed by the left arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he wrote it, Klein took it and took it over and read it out from the section of Daniz that was not elaborated. It is indeed the most typical and worst pirate. It not only plunders property, but also kills the population, slaughters the crew, and abuses women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz, this pirate knows how to write Guvsack... It’s also educated... Klein sighed in his heart and smashed Copper penny, using the divination method to confirm the authenticity of the material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he used the tone of the morning to tell what to eat early:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admiral 'and his men.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be detailed information... Is this ready to hunt them? Daniz’s heart is happy, but he only hates that he doesn’t know enough:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“’The blood will be above’ Senegal’s suspected evil spirits, where His people will die bizarrely, or kill themselves, or kill themselves, or actively embrace the bombs, or slaughter their companions. Our captain said that this is a possession of evil spirits."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much like Miss Sharon’s extraordinary ability... "Resentment"? Klein didn't talk, listening to Daniz silently to say the following. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Senior can make a terrible scream. When I last fought with them, I almost got fainted and fell from the deck to the sea. Oh, I went back and lit them a boat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seneol knows a lot of magic of the dead spirit, cruel, bloodthirsty, desire Exuberant, the goal is that men are women or even humanoid creatures. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the indulgence characteristics of the rose school, um, accurately speaking, is a certain aspect of the "prisoner" approach... The big probability is "resentment"... Ryan’s thoughts were lowered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Daniels who got the response were more active, and the speed of speech increased a little faster:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our captain thinks that Senol has a very powerful magical item. Let him become quite lucky, always get the care of the gods, for example, at the crucial moment, the opponent suddenly slips, or the ability fails, for example, gambling wins 21 consecutive games."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A magical item that makes people lucky? This is very rare... from the "monster" route? Or which evil spirit is associated with it? Klein made a guess based on his own knowledge of occultism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't have a direct hand with Senigal, I only know so much." Daniz wanted to spread his hand but was stopped by the pain of his left arm. "He has about seven or eight ships, and the flagship is the 'Blood Tree'. Hehe, this is different from us. We mainly chase the treasures, and we will not overwhelm our people. Only the 'Golden Dream' is a ship." It’s no wonder that “the blood is above” is much more than the “Iceberger” in the bounty, reaching 42,000 pounds... the strength should be stronger... Klein was a bit stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He keeps his posture unchanged and does not seem to be affected by the intelligence of the "blood":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your hand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi is ready to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The strongest people in Senigal have ten people, the flagship mate, the second officer, the third officer, and the captain of each ship...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Steel' is the flagship second, we guess there is a sequence of 6, the body is like steel, can block bullets and shells, not afraid of fire, not afraid of drowning, not afraid of a variety of magic, powerful, quick action, can directly tear opponents Mastering certain necromantic spells, you can wake up the dead body and cultivate the cockroaches..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Live corpse"? Klein directly associates with that Maric, who is playing a living corpse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with the "respiratory" characteristics of "the blood above", can you think that this pirate is actually Outside the rose school I organized the organization, or the organization used to make money? Unfortunately, I didn’t have a messenger, and I didn’t ask Miss Sharon if I had it. Otherwise, I can contact her to confirm the identity of “the blood will be above”... Klein regretted speculatingly <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not give up because this may involve the Rose School, anyway, he could change his face, change his identity, and, Aurora, Witch, Redemption, The twilight hermit will be provoked, and I am not afraid to offend one more.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I have not opposed the Rose School, and I have already killed a "resent" , a "live corpse", a "werewolf", robbed "Crimson Moon" and "biotoxin bottle"... Klein suddenly found that he had really provoked a lot of things.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"McViti should have no magical items that are particularly powerful, otherwise I might not be able to escape before. "Daniz is quite fortunate to say, "He has a group of scorpions and living corpses, and he has several serial 7 sequences of 8 under his command as the flagship second officer. Since he is here, he should be the leader of nearby people. We can consider hunting him first. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the high sequence, the number of extraordinary people is more than qualitative, and the combination of different abilities is enough for them to defeat the extraordinary who is stronger than themselves. Just like a night squad can definitely win a sequence of 6, or even a sequence of 5... Klein is not as strong as the "squirming hunger", it despise "steel" Maviti and his men Still as cautious as usual.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must plan your actions and be prepared. Well, the bands and passwords you get from the White Shark can come in handy. When the "Magician" Miss's radio receiver is sent, let Daniz listen to it every day to see if he can get the corresponding information, let me seize the opportunity of fast harvesting... and I will take this gap and look for the real play. The possibility... Klein soon had a belly case and continued to listen to Daniz’s message about "the blood above the other".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, After the completion of Daniz, he concluded with great interest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp; "If you can kill the 'Steel' Maviti and leave my name, this thing will definitely go to the newspaper, spread it out, I don't have to worry about how to inform the captain! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was afraid of a traitor inside, and the entire Rothde Islands contact point has been controlled by the enemy, dare not rashly contact, is worried about how to make the captain alert .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
