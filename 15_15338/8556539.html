			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of December 31, the South Bridge, Harvest Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White is wearing a priest's gown, standing in the kitchen, sometimes throwing different herbs into the big iron pot, with some stirring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the materials prepared in advance were finished, he waited patiently for ten minutes before picking up the dark black liquid with an iron spoon and loading them separately. Next to the glass bottle and glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48,49,50...Emlin took aim at the empty iron pot and counted the prepared potions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming the quantity, he picked up the large tray and sent a bottle of dark green liquid to the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, the seat of prayer was removed, and the ground was covered with a tattered bed, lying or sleeping or painful plague. Infected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin and Fr. Uttraski collaborate, each carrying a part of the potion, distributed from both directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first place is a middle-aged man with a sallow face. He is busy half-lifting, taking medicine and drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning the bottle, he is grateful to Emlin Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father White, it’s too Thank you, I feel much better, and I have a little strength!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin raised his chin and replied disdainfully:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just a very small thing, it is not worth thanking, you are too ignorant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He speeded up the dispensing of medicines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After ten minutes, he returned to the altar of the Mother Earth and complained to Father Uttraski:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should find two more volunteers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Uttraski did not respond, looking at those patients, gentle Laughter: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In two or three days, they should be able to heal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you know?" Emlin was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Uttraski looked down in kindly and looked at him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The herbal medicine is one of the fields of the mother god. As a believer, although he is not in the 'earth' path, he still needs to understand basic common sense.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mlin snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not interested in religion, I don't know much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Although I have often copied the Holy Scriptures of the Mother Earth in recent months... He added a little resentment in his heart, so he said casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Father, I didn't expect you to receive the believers. Only two or three of them are believers of the mother god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Uttraski careslessly Laughter: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are also life, innocent lives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin stays After a few seconds, I vomited and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"French, I have found a solution to psychological cues, and may soon leave here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, why should I mention this matter? I was touched by him. What if he shut me down to the basement? Emlin suddenly became nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Uttraski’s expression has not changed, looking down at Emlyn Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"After waiting for a while, I will become the mother god, no, the goddess of the earth god gods!" Emlin blurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Uttraski moved his eyebrows and said a little strangely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I didn't force you to change your faith.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My psychological suggestion is just to let you go back to the church every day, I hope you can fully appreciate the value of life, harvest Joy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only effect of the psychological suggestion is to get me back to the church?" "Emlin's expression is sluggish.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Uttraski nodded calmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Emlin’s mouth was half-open, slow-moving and mechanically looking back at the altar and looking to the life emblem of the Mother Earth. It seems to have become a doll in an instant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December 31 In the evening, Tingen City, No. 2 Narcissus Street.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson enters the house, takes off his hat, takes off his jacket, and laughs:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have booked a steam train ticket to Beckland on January 3, second class. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melisa, sitting in the dining room and holding a few newspapers in front of her, said with a slight anxiety:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Banson, Beckland's air is too bad, only a few days ago due to poisoning and disease caused by heavy fog, tens of thousands of people died..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really a regrettable and sad thing. "Banson went to the restaurant and sighed and said, "But the upper and lower houses have passed the report of the Air Pollution Investigation Committee, and there will be corresponding legislation to regulate the emission of smoke and waste water. We will be the new Beckland, you will not Need to worry too much. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he smiled ridiculously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just got from the iron cross When the street came back, I found that many factory owners or their employees from Beckland had recruited people there, saying that because of the smog and plague, the factories there were understaffed, so they were willing to promise working hours and The minimum reward will be much stronger than the current standard of travel, huh, huh. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think is impossible? Melissa is keenly questioning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When more and more people flock to Beckland, it is doomed to be impossible unless the upper and lower houses pass The corresponding bill is directly regulated. "Banson spread his hand and pointed at the table. "Okay, we should welcome the New Year." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three cutlery, three empty porcelain plates, and three cups on the table.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In three cups, one is beer and the other two are ginger beer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;December 31, evening.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costumed Audrey stood in the lounge, waiting for the start of the New Year’s party, but from her On the expression, I can't see the excitement, excitement and joy of coming to the ceremony.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a newspaper in front of her, which reads:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... According to preliminary statistics, more than 21,000 people died directly in the smog, and the subsequent spread of the plague has taken nearly 40,000 people, which is not lacking. Young children, strong young men and women..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, Audrey couldn’t help but close her eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, her father, Earl Hall, and her mother, Caitlin People knocking at the door, simultaneous praise Road: <br <br /> & nbsp />; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Audrey sighed slowly and burst into an elegant and bright smile. With her father and mother, she walked out of the lounge and into the party hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked all the way to the forefront of the high platform, in a stunning gaze, handed the hand with elbow white gauze gloves to the queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queen took her to the edge of the high platform and faced all the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly paused, the Queen smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although this is the history of Beckland In the dark hours, but we still have a gem that illuminates the whole city, her wisdom, her beauty, her character, her etiquette, are impeccable.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Today, I will officially introduce you to you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Audrey Hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the floor-to-ceiling window, the fireworks lifted off and blew up another piece of dreamy light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night of the last day of 1349, Audrey was officially adult in social terms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afternoon of January 3, 1350. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the outskirts of the Eastern District, in a newly opened cemetery,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein used divination to find The grave of the old Kohler and Lif mother and daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a real grave, but a cabinet for storing urns, one after the other, one row in a row, one overlap and one weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stood there and saw that not only the old Kohler’s cabinet had no legacy or epitaph, but even the name was missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar situation is not uncommon. There are too many uninhabited ashes who can't find relatives and friends. What is their name in front of them? What kind of experience, no one knows, no one is interested, only the number on the cabinet can distinguish them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed his eyes, took out a note pad, shook it into pieces of iron, and carved a word on the door:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Köhler."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he added the epitaph:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a good worker, he once had a wife and a pair of children, he worked hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting the wrist, After a moment of sighing, the black-haired brown-faced face of the thin Klein let the paper burn in his hand, as if to pay homage to all the souls here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the loss of his mother and sister, he did not directly help, but wrote an anonymous letter to Mike Joseph, detailing the dilemma of the girl. So as not to be involved in each other because of their own affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike reporters have seen Daisy, know her things, and enthusiastically promote the establishment of the corresponding charity fund, so Klein believes he will help the West To get more help, she can complete her basic studies and find a stable job that can support her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two steps, Klein looked around and left only the name and photo, and even the victims who did not have the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his head, slowly spit out his breath, turned his body and left the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the steam train to Beckland, Melissa focused on the textbook, and Benson quickly chatted with the surrounding passengers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Too expensive, too expensive, a full 10 Sule, half a pound!" A young man of less than thirty sighed from the heart, " If I haven’t bought a third-class seat and a ticket recently, I won’t spend it at all, which is equal to my salary for most of the week!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
