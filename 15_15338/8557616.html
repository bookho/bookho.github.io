			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large, black-and-white eyes are translucent, quietly floating behind the rich and distinct overlapping patches, showing no hostility and no friendliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, Klein remembered a passage on the note in "Spiritual Insights," the ancestor of the Abraham family said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try not to confront any spiritual creature for more than three seconds. This is provocative unless they have expressed the message you want to communicate; don't let yourself appear fearful and nervous. Will increase the predator's desire to attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corresponding words flow in my heart, Klein retracts his gaze and continues to "chasing" the hardwood cane flying in front, speed Not fast or slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wore black full body armor, wearing a black crown, with the same color cloak into the round eyes, and quickly passed, far from seeing, not excited The slightest change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, the spiritual world is a very dangerous place. If you don’t pay attention, you may encounter a semi-god-level horror... Klein continues to shuttle and discover It's really confusing here. The seven bright brilliances that can be used to identify the location are always at a height, covering the "sky," but they can often be seen at the foot, around, and around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it weren’t for a black cane, Klein couldn’t tell the direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, through the faint fog, he saw a floating castle on the lower left side of the normal person concept. It was black, and the spire was towering and overgrown. The vines are very Gothic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the castle, stood a translucent woman, she was almost as tall as the castle, wearing a complex, dark and dark black dress, she did not There are neat incisions in the head and neck, and the drooping hands are carrying four red-haired eyes and a bright-looking head. If you look closely, you will find these heads exactly the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Black Emperor" dressed up as Klein passed, the woman with four heads with their eyes closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not respond and flew indefinitely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman slowly turned her body and let her head look away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are these monsters... Klein’s thoughts just flashed, and he saw the black cane rushing down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly chased, once again tasted the taste of free fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven or eight seconds, he appeared in front of a looming collapsed building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the building, there is a giant jellyfish-like spirit creature that stretches out a transparent tentacles that cover the mucus and incorporates the surrounding area into its own "territory". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of each tentacle has a white gimmick with a narrow eye socket, which sways as it swings lightly and slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cane passes through this grotesque spiritual creature and hovering in front of the nearly illusory collapsed building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found? Klein first had a joy, and immediately looked at the giant "Jellyfish" who wielded his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was ready for the battle, but did not immediately start, but tried to spread the deep sense of majesty brought by the "Black Emperor" card high personality characteristics. The eyes are indifferent to the dark and deep eye holes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three seconds of solidification, Klein whispered and spit out a Guhemian word:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Leave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tentacle with his head twitched twice, and the giant "Jellyfish" slowly floated and disappeared into the depths of the spirit. At the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "Black Emperor" card is still very useful... I have considered whether or not to lose Mr. Azick’s copper whistle, and the descendants of death should still be in the spiritual world. Some face... Klein sighed and went down, holding the black hardwood cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, even if the storm church and the kingdom military have found this place in advance, took the most valuable items, but as long as there is still a little surplus, it will be quite satisfactory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you don’t have anything, you can study the ruins of the elves and see what information they left, enough... Klein penetrates the curtain There is no “barrier”, and the air around the synapse becomes thick and heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sloshing wave around him, which came from the deep blue water that filled the area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the sea is an ancient ruin, all buildings have collapsed or collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge pillar engraved with singular patterns and symbols protrudes from the center and has a tendency to go straight into the top, seemingly supported here in the past, but Now it has broken and leaned back on top of the nearby building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein recognizes this and recognizes this pillar. This is the hiding place of the "Poseidon" Cavitowa, a hidden place where reality and the spiritual world blend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, an unwilling, painful, angry, crazy roar has long echoed, not weakened, it was issued before the death of Cavitowa. A roar of resentment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really died... Klein held a black cane and landed on the blue-gray stone avenue in front of the ancient ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two pillars on both sides of the avenue that are not too thick and not tall, and they also have singular patterns that are different from the current symbol and magic logo. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the bottom of each stone pillar, there is a figure sitting on them, some of them are covered with old robes, some are draped in the popular brown jackets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After feeling someone approached, they picked up long swords, axes and other weapons, and the movements were stiff but swiftly climbed up and turned to where Klein was. The weathered black face and the dry body without flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They’s fanatical and numb-eyes were cast at the same time with a black crown and Klein in black armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cavi Tuva’s devotees...but this also shows that the Storm Church and the Kingdom’s military have not found it yet... Klein sighs and will Spiritually infused into the "sun brooch", a low-ordered ancient Hermes word:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the "sacred vows" attached to the "sun brooch" and temporarily added sacred damage to his attacks through the corresponding ancient Hermes words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shakes his wrist and licks his cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slipped his body and rushed to the first "Poseidon Guard". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the high-speed running, Klein suddenly left his body, escaped the axe that the enemy had cut down, and smashed his arm and pulled it out with his cane. A clear trace of gray cracking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that trace, the clear golden flame is silent and free, and the "Poseidon Guard" is wrapped inside, burning it to be crumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein tried hard to cross the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind him, the completely dry-out "Poseidon Guard" finally fell, and turned into ashes in the golden flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬! Klein's back was low, his footsteps flew forward, sometimes sideways, and sometimes slantedly passed by a "Poseidon Guard". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he waved his cane, or pumped, or stabbed, or squatted, or stroked, leaving a different trace on the corpse-like guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬! Hey! Hey! Through this avenue, Klein arrived in front of the semi-collapsed remains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
