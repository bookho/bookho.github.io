			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sequence 0, "Red Priest"... Which is the route 0 of which route? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also know the real name of a sequence of 0... Of course, the premise is that the evil spirits are not lying...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It said that the holder of the "Red Priest" card found the underground remains of the Tuyu family because of some degree of attraction, and died in the room... This should be the extraordinary characteristics of the same way. The law of aggregation? No, Russell’s Emperor seems to mention that after the promotion of the sequence, holding the corresponding “Big Card”, it can subtly sense the extraordinary materials needed for the follow-up...that is, the room where the seal is evil, hiding The semi-god character of the "Red Priest" approach... Perhaps, the evil spirits are the demigods of this route, even stronger...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subtle sensation provided by "Beizhi" is probably based on the law of aggregation...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought a lot, and looked at Sharon with a subconscious mind. See what reaction she is, to determine whether she knows the "brand of cards" and whether she understands the meaning of sequence 0. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sharon’s white-to-transparent face has no change in expression, as if the evil spirits are just an ordinary tarot card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this explains some problems. When every extraordinary person first hears the sequence 0, he will always subconsciously think about what it means... maybe only The extraordinary person of the "audience" approach can see Miss Sharon's subtle body language... Klein secretly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that both of them were silent at the same time, the evil spirit looked at Klein deeply and slowly let the "Big Card" projection in his hand disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks at Sharon again with bloodshot eyes, and laughs dumbly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't want to be a demigod of the heterogeneous pathway, then I can provide the sequence 4 potion recipe of the abyss. The desire for restraint and the viciousness of publicity have always been very good, isn't it?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon ignored the evil spirit's counter-inquiry, and turned to look at Klein slowly and slowly, indicating that he would respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of the evil spirits, the heterogeneous pathway and the abyss pathway are similar pathways that can be exchanged in high sequences... The external manifestations of the rose school and the blood religion are indeed Quite similar... Klein thought for two seconds, looking at the bloody "Rift Pound": <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How should you lift your Seal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil spirit laughed a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very simple, find Sauron The direct descendants of the Einhorn and Medici families, respectively, get 10 ml of blood, which can be a little more, not less.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then and the holy water Mix together and spill into my room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way, the seal is lifted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a very simple and weird way, Even in the field of occultism, it is rare... Why must it be the direct descendants of the Sauron, Einhorn and Medici families? I haven't heard of the latter. Soren is the former royal family of Intis. Einhorn is the royal family of the Fossac Empire. The commonality of both is that they have allegedly loyal to the Truncost Empire. The angel family of Ji is the final winner, but the Augustus of Lun and the Castilla family of Fenetport also meet such conditions... Yes, the Sauron and Einhorn families also have The common denominator is to master the "hunter" approach! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the reason for being selected? Amount... In combination with the previous situation, the "hunter" approach is equal to the "red priest" approach? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s heart speculation, did not conceal his own doubts:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I know Soren And the Einhorn family, but have never heard of the Medici family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is normal, they always like to hide in the shadows, they are The polluted angels, they have established an extremely secretive organization." The evil spirits smiled contemptuously. "The organization is called 'redemption rose'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Related to the 'real creator'?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil spirits for two seconds, low and deep questions:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know 'redemption'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Occasionally heard." Klein said the absolute truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil spirit thought for a moment and suddenly said with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your secret is more than I imagined More is needed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we not discuss this? Klein controlled himself not to see Sharon’s reaction, but the face was light and open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze of the evil spirits swept over the faces of the two men and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' Redemption Rose has a close relationship with the birth of the 'real creator'. Some of the guys you can never imagine have been members of the 'Redemption Rose', but later separated from this organization.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you can find the organization that believes in the 'real creator' and follow it all the way, you will always be exposed to the 'redemption rose'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds a bit like "Twilight Hermit", a positive and a negative feeling... Klein intuitively makes a guess.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the evil spirit did not provide an in-depth introduction to the idea of ​​"redemption of roses", he smiled and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think of us? Can strength accomplish such a thing? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil spirit is silent for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe you can go to Binxi Town Take a chance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Binsey Town? where is it? Klein continued to ask, but the evil spirits would never reveal more.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this situation, Klein had to ask: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the Quaternary, the 'Black Emperor', 'Blood Emperor' and 'Night Emperor' are fighting for the position of sequence 0? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil spirits heard, stunned, and immediately laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to be Later, it wasn’t. After Arista’s madness, it’s not. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alysta. Is the ‘blood emperor’? Klein sought confirmation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil spirit nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, 'blood The emperor has one and only one, that is, Alista. Tulu, a madman, hehe, the descendants of the Tuyu family, have inherited the crazy blood, usually sly, treacherous, careful, cautious, but the key moment is easy The mind is hot, and the consequences are not taken into account. "The evil spirit refers to the face of Raft Pound. "He is an example. However, with this lesson, he will definitely be normal for a long time... I don't know if he is the last one. Alysta has left a lot of good things, and the blood of the descendants needs to be opened. You better not kill him now. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil spirits paused, whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, wait for you Help me get rid of the seal, and I will tell you about the stories I have experienced. No, the more accurate description is the history I have experienced. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Raft Pound’s eyes lost his focus.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He The body twitched a few times and fell softly on the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon looked at the scene quietly and suddenly stepped forward.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind swelled, the earth and stones on the ground moved, falling into the tunnel, closing the import. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein boarded the rental carriage, Sharon appeared and sat opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Klein with a sneak peek, and the voice was imaginary and ethereal: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Would you help it unblock it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Klein answered without hesitation and immediately asked, "What about you?" ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon shook his head and said that it would not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sighed with relief and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has been dead for two thousand years Left and right, now is only the remaining evil spirit, dissipating or returning to the spiritual world is the ending it should get. My idea is that when we have a high sequence, we will join hands to clear it and give it a real relief."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the "Red Priest" card, the hidden history of the Quaternary and the promises of the evil spirits are very attractive, Klein has no trust in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always remembers the scene of the evil spirit’s body sitting on a high back chair with his head down, recalling that the other person looked up, The face is full of decay marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon "hmm" gave a necessary response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shouldn’t ask the question, why do you have the confidence to be a high sequencer? Klein couldn't help but swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to that question is that people should be good at dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein no longer struggles with this topic and instead asks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Resentment' Is the corresponding sequence 4 really a 'puppet'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a potion recipe or extraordinary material?" Klein asked thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will help you keep an eye on my circles "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon said the same thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked out of the window and indulged:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to the South for a holiday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he is like a lawyer for Ergen, smiling and talking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Say ahead, you and Maric are happy new year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon silently for two seconds, licked his lips and responded with a whispered voice:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy New Year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her figure faded and disappeared into the compartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the little boy behind the altar, listening to him slightly hoarse The tender voice, Dairik seems to face the most terrible monster, almost smashed the "Hurricane Axe" in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his common sense, it is definitely not human beings who can survive in pure darkness for a long time. Even if it was, it will not be for a long time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The demon hunter" Colin’s eyes seemed to be brighter again, and the palm of his sword was tight, and the voice asked quietly:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
