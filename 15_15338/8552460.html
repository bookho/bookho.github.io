			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the outskirts of Tingen, a house with a green lawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a garden that began to wither in early September, with a dark red chimney. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bedroom window of the house has a desk with an ordinary note on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slightly pale hand flipped the note to the original page and then continually turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the slap of the paper, the lines of text are vaguely presented:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is a logical coincidence that member Rekins mistakenly sold the Antignus family notes as a general ancient book because of the dual effects of exhaustion and illusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Called by the blood of the Antignus family, notes quietly affected one of its masters, and moved to Tingen, to the members of the Aurora, Sirius Aripes and Henas. In the hands of Sent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After turning over the contents of the notes and copying the corresponding potion formula, Sirius and Hainas are worried about being good at divination. The secrets will be traced to them. After consultation, they decided not to take the risk and resell the notes to others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They did not wait for Mr. Z’s Reply, this may be because the other person lives in the port of Enmat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through Siri In the introduction, Henas met with the history student of Hoy University, Welch McGovern, and sold the Antignus family notes as ordinary books to the other party."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After that, Sirius was attracted by the treasures of the main peak of Hornachs, began to enter the Devils Library, looked through the corresponding information, did not think there was any problem left his real address and Name, this is in line with his character."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was in this process that he met Llanus who looked at the iron ore information and tried to carry out the fraud. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lalus's hidden madness and blackmail, which Sirius appreciated very much, decided to develop each other to become a member of the Aurora, of course, before It is inevitable that the examination is inevitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sirius concealed the evil ritual of praying for the 'real creator' to drop the son, and revealed it to Lalhus, but He knows that the success of the other party may be low because the ceremony is very difficult and needs The conditions are quite demanding, while the latter expresses a strong interest in the extraordinary rewards of the gods rewards that may be obtained, and plans to complete the ceremony while building the steel company."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The sneaky Llanus saw that there was a problem with Sirius Aripes, but he did not expose the other for his own purposes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He once again visited Hood Eugen in the madhouse. They knew each other and knew each other's situations. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After a black divination, the power of the Antignus family notes was completely awakened, Welch and his classmates died, survivors Len Moretti, driven by the notes, sent it to Riel Bieber's home, which was a doomed ending. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The following is a lot of lines, and then there are new content):<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What is puzzling is that there is no reason to believe that Klein did not commit suicide and survived. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Through Welch's case, he met Dunn Smith and joined the Night Squad. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is beyond the description of Ings Zangwell, but does not seem to affect the development of the story." "<b /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bakus and his brothers turned bad luck, lost the last chip at the gambling table, owed a lot of debt, they Decided to make a sum of money and decided to kidnap and extort a wealthy businessman. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" When they chose the last hiding point, they accidentally took a fancy to the room opposite Riel Bieber's house. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, he was stunned, and he was in a state of semi-crazy. He failed to make the best and safest choice. He abandoned the mother of death, but he still stayed in Tingen, just looking for a more hidden place. It’s sad to hold a digestive ritual. If he can be a little smarter, the story will become more complicated, but his choices are also in line with his current state and implicit logic.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bakus and others bought weapons and targeted the tobacco trader Wickrol’s youngest son, Eliot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In the end, they successfully carried out the kidnapping and brought Elliot back to the opposite of Riel Bieber’s house. Vicker’s old housekeeper was entrusted by the owner and began to seek help from the security company.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the impact of Welch’s death, the security company and the private detective industry’s staff were nervous, and it was coincidental that they met a waiter who delivered the meal, coincidentally The existence of the Black Thorny Security Company."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Leonard Mitchell and Klein accepted the commission and relied on the ability of the extraordinary to quickly save Eliot. Unfortunately, Klein could not immediately find the opposite of the Antignus family notes. Clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, his spirituality reminded him in his dream that the Tingen City Night Watch team got the corresponding clue."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The seal '2-049' arrived in Tingen, with the help of this Antigonus family The puppet, Dunn Smith led the nights to find Riel Bieber, interrupting his digestive process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Riel Bieber It became a monster, and the scene was out of control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the end, the familiar nights solved the monster Bieber, but they immediately faced the secret The members of the meeting attacked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(There are many lines that have been painted, it is difficult to see the original content):<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hidden The dense Leonard was about to let things end without doubt, and Klein, who should have died, once again made people incomprehensible to kill the members of the sequence 7."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This did not affect the development of the story, Dunn Smith touched the notes of the Antigonus family, looked at its contents, was concealed and polluted a bit! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Larousus who completed all aspects of preparation confuses Hood. Eugen, let him help him to hold a ceremony, using the fiancee's fiancee, Mei Gaoousi, as the carrier to breed the son of the 'real creator'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lalhous has almost no chance of success. The most serious problem is that even with the protection of ritual power, Mei Gaoousi can't bear with the gods. The intersection of the illusory projections will make her die on the altar. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At this time, the kindly Ins. Zangweier secretly helped Lalhous, who divided the characteristics of the descendants of death collected in half. A certain amount of time was implanted in the body of Megaco. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hood Eugen let Mei Gaoous enter a semi-conscious state, letting her take the illusory projection of 'real creator' as Languwu In the factory area, the accumulated resentment of the day and night, under the catastrophic faintness and suppression, the ritual succeeded, and Mei Gaoousi was pregnant with the son of the 'real creator'. The god saw the matter. Coincidence, but he did not refuse to break through the Seven Gods blockade. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hood Eugen was infected. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the ritual success, the crazy Laurus regained his intellect, and he knows very well that if the son of the god is truly born in the real world, then he Will become one of the sacrifices, how can mortals become the father of the gods? This is great! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lalhous decided to leave Tingen early, and told the nightmare, the punisher and the mechanical heart about this 'bomb'. They solve their own problems for themselves, and madness always comes at a price. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Lairus did not write directly to the extraordinary team, which he thought would make him an idiot. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to insure, he also informed Sirius Aripis in a safe way, the latter did not believe, but felt the possibility of success."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Selena Wood accidentally and coincidentally saw her from the mysterious teacher, Heiners Vansente. The real curse of the mirror divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her bold attempt happened to meet Klein Moretti, who successfully solved this possible Extraordinary cases of major casualties."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Night Squad has found Hainas Vansente, but this Aurora will be rewarded, so Dunn Smith, in a coincidence, saw the clear image of the 'real creator' in his dreams, and suffered tremendous damage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he did not As a result, the infection will be noticed by the top officials of the night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This injury made Dunn Smith the note of the Antignus family The infection caused by the secret is further serious, and the symptoms of paralysis and omission are strengthened. He will meet the requirements of Ins. Zangweier step by step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(There are many lines that have been crossed out)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's unbelievable! Klein Moretti perceives the secret influence of Ins Zangweier and sees the dark red chimney."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is because of Hoy Azick, a faculty member of the Department of History of the University, reminded him that there are many secrets in his possession."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even so, Klein can find specific clues, enough surprise "Unexplained things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whatever the reason, Ings. Zangweier did not stop his actions, the story continues." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein met Sirius in the library and couldn’t stop killing each other, so the clue to Llanus’s thing was broken. Half, the discovery of the problem was delayed and pushed back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein met Megos, but spirituality stopped him." The view, and he did not notice the subtle anomalies afterwards, it is logical, our story is not made up. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He collected information on the red chimney, but he always picks the route that does not contain the target, maybe wait until two or three months, wait until the last batch He can discover the real 'red chimney house'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The lines of the line are smeared, more than the previous ones More)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem of Dunn Smith has been alleviated! His condition is obviously improving! He actually mastered the ‘playing law’! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this is what Klein Moretti taught him. He found inspiration from the examples of Dailie Simone and Old Neil. No, Inns Zangweier doesn't believe it, but he can only change the original plan a little. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The story has a new wave. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Azick decided to go to Beckland in search of past memories. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It didn't take long, and Klein and Dunn got a clue from Hood Eugen." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Xue Lun to make the Conservative Party and the New Party in Tingen completely Opposing, in order to change the body, a little accumulated madness was vented, and decided to take the risk of killing John Maynard. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her reasons are not enough, her motivation is not strong enough, but she is still acting, everyone is not clear enough, she is in this way Stage, and she has sufficient confidence not to be discovered. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
