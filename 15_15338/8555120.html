			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did Miss Justice look at himself, Klein knows very well that the other side of the Llanus incident must have thought that he and the "real creator" have secretly Many battles, mastering the corresponding items is normal, and the number may even be quite large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a logical point of view, her thoughts have no problems, but in fact, several times I have dealt with the "real creator", I do have articles that match the description. ... Klein sighed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help doesn't help the little "Sun" There is no doubt for him. The "God of Abandoned Land" where Silver City is located has many monsters and can collect a lot of The North and South continents have been quite rare and extraordinary materials. Moreover, their history has not been interrupted, and no church has been distorted by any of the gods. It is the most intuitive representation of the stories and secrets before the Cataclysm. Knowledge, whether from the standpoint of the leader of the Tarot Club, or simply considering the interests, not completely hopeless, Klein does not intend to give up the small "sun" and give up the Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some words are not suitable for Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as "justice" Audrey looked at the "fool" who was covered in thick fog after looking forward to the "world" Opening:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an item containing the "real creator" spirit pollution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He refers to the "All Black Eyes" left by the "Master of Secrets" Rosago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The item containing the 'real creator' spirit pollution?" "The hanging man" Alger thought while organizing the language, "This may help the sun." 'The exploration team members whose thoughts and opinions have been distorted, once the spirit of the 'real creator' is sensed, there is a big probability that there will be a change on the spot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"World" looks to the "sun", snoring and laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little guy, I can lend that item to you, but you What can you pay for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the hope of the "Daily" Dairik’s brain turned fast, remembering the things in front of the party, and quickly said :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can help you collect the characteristics of the shadow of the human skin, the pituitary of the Thousand-faced Hunter's brain, and the blood of the Thousand-faced Hunter. You will also try to get the way to remove the mental pollution of the out-of-controller in the item. If you get it first, you will use it as a reward."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, the shadow of the human skin is relatively easy to encounter, belonging to the terrible kind of monsters in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Dairik now considers whether the value is equal or not, although the item contaminated by the real creator is obviously not as good as the one he proposed. A condition, but in the current situation, what kind of high price the other party can open, he may bite his teeth, so it is better to show sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"World" gently daggers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, I will ask Mr. Fool" Help, lend it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, he has the appearance of "all black eyes" and adds:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's the equivalent of a sequence of 5, if you lose it, you must make a compensation, and, when the matter is over, give it back to me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the words that Klein can't say as a "fool". There is a hidden secret of the gods. If the opening is closed, it is "compensation". And "remember to return me", the person fell from the sky to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Klein also considered the hidden dangers in the future:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All Black Eyes "The other items belong to the type he used in the real world. If he later pulls in a new member who knows the matter, the other party can confirm something from this point, so Sherlock Moratti is equal to the "world". More than Sherlock. Moriarty is equal to "fool" is much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength does not match the personality, you can only fight, such as walking thin ice, such as the abyss... "Foolish" Klein silently sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Mr. Fool did not deny the "world" request, and did not openly point out that there was a problem with the transaction, Dairik rejoiced and relieved, and quickly agreed. All the requirements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, "Justice" Audrey is also sincerely happy for the small "sun". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger thought about it, slowly vomiting and thinking about the "sun":<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not be too optimistic, how to do it must be well grasped, the first is to pick the timing, can not let yourself into danger, it is best to have only one exploration team member, and many other residents of Silver City, or they They are all in a state of being held in a sealed state... You must close the container in which the item is located in advance with a spiritual wall, so that you can not directly detect it, so that you can control the progress of things in your own hands... In addition, you still I have to think about how to hide the item afterwards. I can't let the 'six-member board' discover it, otherwise you can't elute it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So good to lie If the guy is dead, it will be very difficult for me to get the information of the "God of Abandonment" and the secrets of the old age... "I don't feel that there is any problem with helping me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his words and deeds, "Sun" Dairik gradually got a complete plan and clarified several key points that need attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Mr. "Down man", thank you, thank you." He sincerely expressed his gratitude to the members of the Tarot Club, which made "Justice" Audrey has a sense of satisfaction in doing good things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "sun" thing came to an end and witnessed the passing of the "magician" Foers suddenly had an idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She licked the long hair of the micro-volume:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to know the 'apprentice' Which family does the route belong to? I am willing to exchange one of the chapters of "Spiritual Knowledge". Although this is considered to be the slang of the whisperer, according to my experience of entering and leaving the spiritual world several times, many descriptions in it are true. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spiritual Insights" is one of the mysterious notes left by Mrs. Anlisa, her content is logically confusing, absurd, only Reading, it will make people become violent, but after three reasons for the body to enter and exit the spirit world, Fols found that this note may not be a slang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spiritual Insights"? "The Fool" Klein leaned back and manipulated the "world" to grab the "opening man" answer before opening:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know the answer and can give you a free gift. Some corresponding messages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very clear that "downside people" can also answer the "magician" problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having competition is not good, you have to match the giveaway... Klein silently whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Fols was delighted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found that Tarot would be much more sophisticated than the other extraordinary people who had participated before, and many difficult questions could be answered here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "world" was dumb and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want only one yourself When people hear the answer, can everyone still?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Foers considered for a few seconds, out of "justice" Audrey et al. It is expected to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her opinion, my own problem The answer is hardly helpful to others, so it doesn't matter if they know it. If Mr. "World" is missing, or the description is not complete enough, just other people know the corresponding content, then they can use the same "spiritual world" See the section of the "See" section. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thinks this is more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "world" is not surprising, low-pitched and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the Quaternary,' The apprentice's path was mastered by the Abraham family, and later flowed into the Tamara family, which had long-term friendship with them. In the fifth era, the current era, the 'Gongzhihui' also had 'apprentices' and 'masters of tricks' potions. It is widely believed to be related to the Abraham and Tamara families. Of course, some people suspect that the 'King of Knowledge' is actually a 'witch sect' disguise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering Miss "Magic" has already met members of the Abraham family, and Klein has manipulated the "world" to add one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
