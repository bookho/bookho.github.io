			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the request of "Stars above", Klein did not agree to the reason, thought for two seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"700 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is fair." Jia Delia has no counter-offer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary characteristics of Sequence 8 are normally six or seven hundred pounds, but if you are in urgent need, the premium is a common thing, after all, this kind of item, one In extraordinary gatherings, there may only be one such thing in a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not complete the transaction immediately, and the expression raised the box without change:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To you tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not carry the extraordinary character of "fighting home" with him, and most of the valuable things were thrown into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The star above" Jia Delia's answer to German Sparrow was not unexpected, and he nodded:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar situation, she has encountered a lot, which often means extraordinary with "fighting home" The features are put together with certain items that cannot be known by outsiders, so it is impossible for German Sparrow to open the suitcase in person and complete the transaction on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crazy adventurer is always a bit secret! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia De Li Ya paused for one second and added another sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your room will not There is any sneak peek."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be seen directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter." Klein outlined his mouth and smiled indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His previous plan was to place Azik’s copper whistle, Will Anthony’s paper crane, etc. when holding a ceremony or entering the fog. Come out, fight against the mysterious sense, and then use the washroom method to avoid physical monitoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he is not worried that "the star will be" will be too much, this is not to think that the other party will be afraid of the crazy adventurer, German Sparrow, Instead, I feel that Jia Delia is not so necessary. What she should have is a softer and more subtle way of observation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, ask an extraordinary person in the "audience" path... Klein took off his hat and took a gift, followed by "toxin expert" Frank Lee. Own room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at him not leaving quickly, Jia Delia turned into the captain’s room, picked up the heavy glasses and put it on the bridge of the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, South Bridge, Harvest Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of ordinary people, Utravsky, who is already at the level of the semi-giant, put down the holy scriptures in his hand and looks around the prayer hall.道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are more and more believers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Emlin White, the priest's robe, wiped the candlestick, and the eyelids did not lift the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that after the Bakerland smog incident, the goddess’ believers have indeed grown a lot. Before the weekend, not at night, there were three or five It is a miracle for individuals to pray, and now often close to ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Uttraski looked down at the busy vampire priest, and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "As long as it is not blind, you can see it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this, your contribution is great, if you didn't have the pharmacy, the plague, and later Sincerely teaches the willingness of learners to learn about drugs, and our beliefs are hard to accept by the people of this region. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin took the rag and straightened his back and slightly lifted his chin:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"I am just playing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, what is our faith? Who and you us? He twitched and smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking of the blind, I remembered a joke I saw before, saying that the blind people in Beckland are in short supply. Because they are widely considered to be the best candidates for refereeing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Utlovsky skips a joke, and Cihe says:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For whatever purpose, you have made an outstanding contribution to the spread of the goddess faith.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This also proves that you have a kind heart. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呸! I said that at the beginning, why don't you believe it? Emlin looked up and looked at the priest's huge figure, and silently took back his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was busy with the church, he put on his normal clothes, put on a silk hat that blocks the sun, and went to the rose flower street.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it covertly and left, and found no signs of being monitored.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before that was called Leonard' The red glove 'has really never appeared again... I thought it was the secret of revealing him. After buying the 'fire' glove, he would secretly investigate me..." Emlin White did not see his head shaking, his heart filled with I don’t understand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the initial period, he also wanted to combine the theory of “downside down man” to introduce the “red gloves” investigation, which interfered with the monitoring of the upper blood. In itself, with the help of the goddess Utravsky, the Mother Earth Church achieves a perfect balance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But things didn't develop as he expected, Leonard Mitchell seems to have left Beckland soon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of February, In an outing, Mlin went to No. 7 Pfst Street and found that there was no one living there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer thinking about this, he At the end of the street, I got on a rental carriage and went straight to the villa of the Odra family.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter introduced the study on the first floor, Emlin I saw several blood races that were just a few years old, and even included a family that had become a baron.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not looking for me alone? He thought about it, standing on Closed doorway, to the owner of this place, Kasimi Odra: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord Baron, isn’t Nibes calling me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His baron screamed plainly, as if he was calling the other’s name because he was also a bloody baron, but he had not yet announced it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casimi is a very temperamental middle-aged gentleman, smiling and laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You are all outstanding people of the young generation of the blood, my grandfather entrusted me with some tests." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What test? "Good luck, another bloodline baron, Ruth Bartoli, who inherited the legacy, asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casimimy drank the dark red of the wine. Blood, looking around: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you still don't know, the Life's Snake of the Destiny has been missing for a while. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the horrible atmosphere of Emmling White and other bloody people, I see you in a strange atmosphere, Kasimi continues: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I think you should be very clear that the life school is an organization that is reluctantly united, believes in destiny, and the extraordinary person who admires the absolute rationality and worships the primitive moon, exploring life and The spiritual nature of the believers formed an alliance under the enormous pressure of the seven great churches in the early fifth period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of the existence of the 'Snake of Destiny', there has been no big problem inside them. The worship of the primitive moon has always been confined and fixed to the symbol. In the sense, and through the inheritance of mentoring and apprenticeship, the way of formula exchange is really a little bit true.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, oh, with that 'snake of destiny' The disappearance, the process was interrupted, and the believers of the original moon quickly became fanatical, splitting with factions representing destiny, and a fierce conflict broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
