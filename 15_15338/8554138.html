			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there an abnormal reaction? It seems that it is really the "Big Card"! Get a reply, Klein above the fog is a happy first, then inexplicably marveled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The efficiency of Miss 'Justice' is too high?" br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "I was commissioned afternoon task, she this evening to verify finished ......" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "and This has obviously passed the closing time of the Kingdom Museum!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Readers' is definitely not sneak into the extraordinary ability!"<br / > <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "cries, her family's power is probably bigger than I imagined ......" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "Fortunately, There is no strange phenomenon in the verification, or else the 'Justice' can only be innocent, and the card is handed over, which means that I have nothing to do with the treasure... Nothing is 100% sure..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking between the flashes, Klein heard the follow-up question of Miss Justice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'fool' Sir, that bookmark What hidden secret? "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" Well, if your dependents are not willing to give an answer, when I did not ask "<br /> <br />. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there is a "secret of the card"! Klein was so excited and silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking carefully, he decided to wait for the "Big Card" to respond to Miss "Justice", lest she be too shocked, showing an abnormality, let her The action was badly affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not in a hurry to return to the real world, just sit in the quiet and empty ancient palace, thinking about when to act and how to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missing "Justice" caused a little damage to the bookmark, I don’t know if it will be discovered later... or the bookmark will slowly show up An unusual place to attract attention! So, no delay, no waiting, it is best to start tonight! After various ideas rolled over and boiled for a while, Klein gradually decided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, according to the results of the morning observation, he showed the layout of the first floor of the Kingdom Museum and the surrounding environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at this drawing, Klein deduced a different course of action and quickly established a relatively safe plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he did divination again to confirm the level of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing no change, he returned to the real world and began to make various preparations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein originally wanted to "paint" the patterns in memory, fake a similar bookmark, and then sneak into it. Replace, make sure that this matter has not been noticed for a long time, no one knows, and until the incident, there will be no way to trace him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after repeated scrutiny, I feel that this is not good, as long as the fake bookmarks are discovered, the most doubtful thing is that I touched the original bookmark today. Miss "Justice". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t put a “just” lady at a high risk for the treasure, but she did it to help me! Klein finally thought about how to avoid doubting Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, not only stealing the bookmarks you need, the surrounding parts are taken away, including some lighter books! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Prepare Klein to take out the gold-shelled pocket watch, and glance at it, waiting patiently after 9:00, the time before the early hours of the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too early, the people around have not slept, can't meet the needs of his action plan, too late, there will be almost no pedestrians on the street, just walking on the road, It is easy to be suspected, and during this time, because of the serial killings, the entire Beckland is in a state of tightness and martial law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ticking, ticking, the pointer keeps moving, and as the night darkens, the red moon jumps out and they finally exceed 9 o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein licked the "master key" and other things, took the cane, first went to the Eastern District to change the dress, then took the rental carriage several times, arrived at the West End King's Road has a short distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, time has passed an hour and three quarters of an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His original plan is actually not like this. He wants to use himself to summon himself, to respond to his own way, to become a spiritual state, to rely on extremely fast speed. Leap into the Jowood area to the West End, then sneak into the Kingdom Museum, with the help of that special, undetectable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he eventually gave up on this program because of the potential and high risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland is a strong serialist and there is more than one! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of serial killings, but long-time unbreakable, there may be high-sequence strong people who are consciously using their extraordinary abilities or corresponding Sealed items monitor certain areas, and the distance from Jowood to the West is not long. It is short and short. A special spirit is flying like this, and the probability of being discovered is not low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cannot be completely ignored because the divination result "said that there is a certain danger but not very high", because divination is basically not an intuitive answer, but needs to be interpreted. Inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the result of "having a certain danger but not very high" requires a premise, that is, it has made a relatively good choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Klein was cautious and revised the original plan, but retained the core meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; King's Road 2, Kingdom Museum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the top of the four-slope roof of the polygon, they stood four security guards wearing coats. They endured the cold winds of late autumn night and carefully examined their respective Corresponding directions, once someone approaches the museum, it is difficult to get through their eyes even with the shadows of trees and houses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only from this arrangement, it can be seen that the security company commissioned this time is very professional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still half an hour to rotate..." A security guard looked at the companions around the house and shook his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the museum, the remaining security personnel are divided into four batches, and each exhibition hall is inspected at intervals according to different routes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the exhibition hall where Russell’s diary is stored, the “Mechanical Heart” squad leader Max Levimore wears the one that can directly see the ghosts and shadows. The monocle of the spirit-like monster, carrying the lantern, checking back and forth, and sometimes going out to confirm the situation elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His two subordinates are always in the small hall, staying next to the Russell Diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but on the glass showcase, there is an extra item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bunch of colorful blocks that make up a miniature picture of the first floor of the museum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a sealed item. As long as the deformable blocks are combined into the corresponding buildings, they can be connected with the real things. Once someone breaks in, There will be a narrow response immediately above it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are quite a few restrictions on this correspondence. If you are too far apart, the number of blocks it has is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people and things inside are almost impossible to leave without external help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, do you really have someone to steal this note? I don't understand it at all!" A member of the team saw Max returning with a lantern. I was bored and asked a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some people are very fanatical about Russell's worship, not you can understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They think they can crack, just need more reference Some believe that the symbols themselves contain mysterious power, and as long as they find the right combination, they will gain extraordinary power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Previous In the exhibition, such criminals will be caught from time to time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, we will not take the diary away and put it in the seal. This is waiting for The guy came to 'self-sout'?" Another member asked in a blank voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Max nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The merits of being sent to the front, who wouldn't want?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 18th Avenue, outside the building near the Cross Street . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walked along the shadows and shaded places, using the "master key" from time to time, and finally arrived here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the quaint brass color key again and pointed it at the kitchen door, silently twisting it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undetectable waves of water, Klein entered inside, all the way to see the door, see the wall through the wall, did not alarm anyone to find a store Room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This 'master key' is really practical! Just the two former owners are lost in a dangerous place, people dare not carry it all the time... ..." Klein lamented, taking away the brass-colored key, and in the case of the servant's sleeping room next to it, took out the Holy Night Powder, Shufa spirituality, blocked the entire storage room, so that the movement inside could not Outgoing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he pulled out a candle and placed it on the box in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! He snapped his finger and let the fingertips glow with a light blue spiritual flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the candle was ignited, he summoned himself according to the ritual magic process and responded to himself on the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After less than a minute, Klein floated in the room, opposite the flesh that his eyes had lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting acquainted with this feeling, he wrapped the ancient and exquisite Azick copper whistle, so that the spirit became firm and powerful, let the room There is a cold wind that begins to swirl. At the same time, he used this power to slightly change the way the illusory spirit appeared, making it seem to be painted on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Klein took a box of common matches that he bought at the street and cut a transparent door on the spiritual wall. Go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Action!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He silently drums himself, just like a real ghost In general, through the households of one family and another, they successfully arrived at the periphery of the Kingdom Museum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without turning on the vision, he can clearly see every security guard in this state, their gas field and emotional color are sold out without reservation. they. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding the yellow-graved lawn and the iron-black light pole facing the window of the exhibition hall, Klein did not take advantage of the ordinary people and could not see his advantage. Follow the shadows, follow the hard-to-see routes, pass through the tree carvings, pass through the obstacles, carefully reach the destination, and stick to the walls - he can't guarantee that there is no "mechanical" in the security personnel. The heart of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the four security guards in their respective areas of responsibility are carefully examined on the roof like real blind people, and nothing can be found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not go directly to the exhibition hall, both because his inspiration and intuition told him that the first floor of the museum was shrouded in mysterious power, and because he could not confirm the inside There are no extraordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
