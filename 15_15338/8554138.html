			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there an abnormal reaction? It seems that it is really the "Big Card"! Get a reply, Klein above the fog is a happy first, then inexplicably marveled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The efficiency of Miss 'Justice' is too high?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I only commissioned the task in the afternoon, she verified it this evening..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And This has obviously passed the closing time of the Kingdom Museum!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Readers' is definitely not sneak into the extraordinary ability!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, her family's power is probably bigger than I thought..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There is no strange phenomenon in the verification, or else the 'Justice' can only be innocent, and the card is handed over, which means that I have nothing to do with the treasure... Nothing is 100% sure..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking between the flashes, Klein heard the follow-up question of Miss Justice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'fool' Sir, that bookmark What secrets are there?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey, if your leader is not willing to give an answer, then I didn’t ask.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there is a "secret of the card"! Klein was so excited and silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking carefully, he decided to wait for the "Big Card" to respond to Miss "Justice", lest she be too shocked, showing an abnormality, let her The action was badly affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not in a hurry to return to the real world, just sit in the quiet and empty ancient palace, thinking about when to act and how to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missing "Justice" caused a little damage to the bookmark, I don’t know if it will be discovered later... or the bookmark will slowly show up An unusual place to attract attention! So, no delay, no waiting, it is best to start tonight! After various ideas rolled over and boiled for a while, Klein gradually decided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, according to the results of the morning observation, he showed the layout of the first floor of the Kingdom Museum and the surrounding environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at this drawing, Klein deduced a different course of action and quickly established a relatively safe plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he did divination again to confirm the level of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing no change, he returned to the real world and began to make various preparations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein originally wanted to "paint" the patterns in memory, fake a similar bookmark, and then sneak into it. Replace, make sure that this matter has not been noticed for a long time, no one knows, and until the incident, there will be no way to trace him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after repeated scrutiny, I feel that this is not good, as long as the fake bookmarks are discovered, the most doubtful thing is that I touched the original bookmark today. Miss "Justice". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t put a “just” lady at a high risk for the treasure, but she did it to help me! Klein finally thought about how to avoid doubting Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, not only stealing the bookmarks you need, the surrounding parts are taken away, including some lighter books! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Prepare Klein to take out the gold-shelled pocket watch, and glance at it, waiting patiently after 9:00, the time before the early hours of the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too early, the people around have not slept, can't meet the needs of his action plan, too late, there will be almost no pedestrians on the street, just walking on the road, It is easy to be suspected, and during this time, because of the serial killings, the entire Beckland is in a state of tightness and martial law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is good for Klein’s actions, and it’s also bad! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tick, tick, the pointer keeps moving, as the night darkens, the red moon jumps out, they finally exceed 9 o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein licked the "master key" and other things, took the cane, first went to the Eastern District to change the dress, then took the rental carriage several times, arrived at the West Road, there is a short distance to the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, time has passed an hour and three quarters of an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His original plan is actually not like this. He wants to use himself to summon himself, to respond to his own way, to become a spiritual state, to rely on extremely fast speed. Leap into the Jowood area to the West End, then sneak into the Kingdom Museum, with the help of that special, undetectable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he eventually gave up on this program because of the potential and high risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland is a strong serialist and there is more than one! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of serial killings, but long-time unbreakable, there may be high-sequence strong people who are consciously using their extraordinary abilities or corresponding Sealed items monitor certain areas, and the distance from Jowood to the West is not long. It is short and short. A special spirit is flying like this, and the probability of being discovered is not low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cannot be completely ignored because the divination result "said that there is a certain danger but not very high", because divination is basically not an intuitive answer, but needs to be interpreted. Inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the result of "having a certain danger but not very high" requires a premise, that is, it has made a relatively good choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Klein was cautious and revised the original plan, but retained the core meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; King's Road 2, Kingdom Museum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the top of the four-slope roof of the polygon, they stood four security guards wearing coats. They endured the cold winds of late autumn night and carefully examined their respective Corresponding directions, once someone approaches the museum, it is difficult to get through their eyes even with the shadows of trees and houses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only from this arrangement, it can be seen that the security company commissioned this time is very professional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still half an hour to rotate..." A security guard looked at the companions around the house and shook his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the museum, the remaining security personnel are divided into four batches, and each exhibition hall is inspected at intervals according to different routes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the exhibition hall where Russell’s diary is stored, the “Mechanical Heart” squad leader Max Levimore wears the one that can directly see the ghosts and shadows. The monocle of the spirit-like monster, carrying the lantern, checking back and forth, and sometimes going out to confirm the situation elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His two subordinates are always in the small hall, staying next to the Russell Diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but on the glass showcase, there is an extra item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bunch of colorful blocks that make up a miniature picture of the first floor of the museum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a sealed item. As long as the deformable blocks are combined into the corresponding buildings, they can be connected with the real things. Once someone breaks in, There will be a narrow response immediately above it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are quite a few restrictions on this correspondence. If you are too far apart, the number of blocks it has is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people and things inside are almost impossible to leave without external help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, do you really have someone to steal this note? I don't understand it at all!" A member of the team saw Max returning with a lantern. I was bored and asked a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Max smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some people are very enthusiastic about Russell’s worship, It's not something you can understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They think that they can crack, just need more reference, and some believe that the symbols themselves contain mystery. Strength, as long as they find the right combination, they will gain extraordinary power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
