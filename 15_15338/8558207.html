			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the copper whistle was put down, Klein had already opened the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the illusory white bones on the ground throwing up, slowly forming a huge body, if the same scene before was like a fantasy version of the fountain, then now it’s just A common faucet in reverse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein’s mouth moved invisibly, pretending that he had not found any anomalies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few seconds, the Bone Messenger finally got together, and the nearly four-meter-high body once again penetrated the ceiling, and the dark flame in the eye socket burned quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein folded the previously written letter neatly and cast it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He described in detail the rich businessman Jimmy Necker, the literature of the gods unearthed in the mausoleum of the Bundan Empire in the South, and the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qilingus and "The disease will be" the relationship between Trey and other things, and mentioned that he completed a sneak, although the assassination failed, but left the props that can be used to determine the location of the black death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, how to sneak into it, he did not talk about it, only roughly restored the "sickness of the disease" Trey's fighting skills and style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the messenger could fly the adult hand to catch the letter, Klein coughed and cleared his throat:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I already have my own messenger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British messenger's dark flame in the eye socket clearly bounced twice The body collapsed and fell like a waterfall, and it was drilled into the wooden floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not be afraid to be my messenger now? Do I hate you so much? Um... It should be that these messengers from the underworld are reluctant to abide Mr. Azker. After all, it is a direct descendant of death. Maybe it has never been a generation, and I have a thigh, I understand! Klein was about to clean up and check out, his nose suddenly itching and sneezing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie! Auntie! Cough and cough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a runny nose and cough, and his forehead is slowly but firmly hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tragic, the disease of the "sickness of the disease" remains in the body, and I rushed back to Baiyam with a cold wind of about 10 degrees Celsius, which is really sick. ... Klein picks up his nose with inferior toilet paper, thinking about whether he should summon himself, act in a spiritual state, and let the flesh heal itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After serious thinking, he believes that this is not feasible. First, the physical state will obviously affect the state of the spirit. There is a close and strange connection between the two. In the case of not going to control, the physical condition will inevitably deteriorate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit confusing... Klein touched his forehead and was ready to return to the "Azure Wind" hotel to meet with Daniz, and then Consider whether you want to go to a hospital or clinic to buy some medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BMW City, Berg Home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric finally got the fruit of the brilliant spirit of the "Hidden" lady, and deployed the "Sun God Official" potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a golden color and comes with a hot temperature. When Dairik drank it, his throat was burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are bright and bright, just like there are two rounds of miniature sun hidden inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body surface blooms in a circle and a bright radiance, and the bare skin reveals a black plaque visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, his hair is getting longer and seems to have turned into a feather with a golden flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick knows that when the sequence is 7, there will be a similar change in taking the potion, no panic, no panic, clenching the teeth, and repeatedly recalling killing by hand. The pain of my own parents and the hope of meeting the "fool" after the deep heart of the "fool", in the situation of the end of the situation is out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, all his anomalies have been calmed down, but the gas spit out is also mixed with the warmth of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that his physique has been enhanced and he has no resistance to the harsh environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is not the point, Dairik prefers the magical knowledge of his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They include "Fire of Light", "Immune Fear", "Sacred Vow", "Purchase of Purification", "Sun Ring", "Summon Light" , "making holy water," and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric is delighted to take two steps back and forth, feeling that these geniuses are really suitable for dealing with evil monsters hidden in the depths of the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not conceal, went straight to the Twin Towers, and registered his promotion information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, after the initial review, he was qualified as the captain of the patrol squad and was able to access more information on the Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes the way that Mr. "World" wants to remove mental pollution from extraordinary characteristics... When Dairik answers various questions from the registrar, I can't help but think of the promise I have never achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; owing to others always makes him uneasy, feeling uncomfortable, and now, he finally sees the dawn of restoring calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fragrant leaf bar, "smartwriter" Misor. Kim took a glass of red wine and sat down on the opposite side of the old man, Ozil, and picked up his right leg. He asked slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the specific situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He accepts the captain’s “Sickness Lieutenant” Trey’s arrangement and returns to Bayam to investigate the problem of false Yilian. To this end, I found Ozil who helped him to issue a task. He could not go directly to the Rebels to ask, because the other party has a small probability of cooperating with the fake Yilian, asking questions and going directly to the Governor’s Office to take care of himself. There is no difference in the reward of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ozl pulled a chair and sat down:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no concealment there, But I'm not sure if they are telling the truth or lies, you know, I like fists better than thinking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They said that Elaine is 'flame 'Daniz sent him, he represents the will of the 'Iceberg Lieutenant', hopes to establish cooperative relations with the Rebels and provide them with certain assistance, while Elaine is expressing goodwill. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"‘flame' Daniz? 'Iceberg Lieutenant'..." Misor chewed the two names, and the expression slowly subsided.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned back against the back of the chair, brow A little wrinkled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the former captain of the "Hurricane Lieutenant", now the flagship of the "Sick of the Lieutenant" three, he is against the rest of the pirate generals No stranger, know that "Iceberger Lieutenant" is powerful and rich in collections. With only one boat and not many people, the ability to resist other pirate generals, simply speaking combat power, may be stronger than the two bosses before and after him. The problem is that "Iceberger Lieutenant" rarely mixes pirate battles to gather information, explore the unknown, find treasures, and like adventurers outperform pirates.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Why did she suddenly want to assassinate the captain? This is not in line with her character... She was previously swearing by the "blood on the top" and should be concentrating on revenge each other... Misor licked the lipstick wine and carried the other The hand licked his forehead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer thinks about it for the time being "Mountain Lieutenant", put his attention back to the "flame" Daniz.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In careful memory, his pupils swelled and found the familiar "golden dream" "The fourth sailor is really having some problems recently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He set a trap and killed 'Steel' McVetti, 'Bloody Thorns' Hunter Lee and calm Scull, the bounty increased to 4,200 pounds, and then in a very short time, I did not know what was involved in the incident, the bounty increased again, reaching 5,500 pounds, which has exceeded me ..." Sol silently said that the "flame" Daniz figure appeared unconsciously, only to realize that the other party is now mysterious and terrible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He Promoted? Or have you gotten great benefits from certain things? "Missor's waist moved, leaning forward and putting down the glass.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
