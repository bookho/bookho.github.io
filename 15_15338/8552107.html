			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den. Smith's mellow and awkward voice came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein twisted the handle, pushed open the door and saw that the captain was enjoying breakfast, and on his right hand was a coffee with a strong scent, placed in front of the plate. White bread, toast and bacon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn put the toast of the butter in the mouth and silently pointed to the chair opposite the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t bother the captain’s meal, smiled, sat down and waited patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that he was not in a hurry, Dunn relaxed his straight back, took the coffee, took a sip, and swallowed all the food in his stomach. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out a soft tissue and wiped his mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein seriously nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen Dast Gudrian The madhouse doctor, a member of the psychological alchemy club."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he swept away in the corner of his eye and found that the captain was still in front of him. Magazine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What information does he provide?" Dunn asked with both hands and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein briefly described: "He told me that before Hood Eugen was mad, someone had visited him frequently, and that person was called Lalus. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lalhous..." Dunn raised his hand and slammed his forehead. "I seem to have heard it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the fraudster who has taken away at least 10,000 gold pounds,” Kline reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn thought with a serious look and shook his head and said that there was no impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, you are not sensitive to money! Klein whispered a whistle and talked about the things related to Lalhous:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The frauder lied to explore and buy a new one. The iron ore with high quality and high reserves has been raised privately in Tingen City, and has swept away more than 10,000 gold pounds. A friend I met at the divination club suffered losses. In addition, another girl was deceived. Engaged with him and pregnant with his children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has visited Hood Eugen before he went crazy..." Dunn sinks Said, "The extraordinary person of the sequence 8 'scammers'? 'The thief' that way..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, you remember very well on similar things ... Klein was so funny that he nodded lightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Because the steel company set up by Lalhous is in the Southern District, the deceiver has various beliefs, so this matter was not transferred to us at the end, even if the police department has issued Some extraordinary traces are also handed over to the 'deceiver' squad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn finally understood the truth of the matter, looking at Klein with a faint ash: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough, captain, don't be so keen... gram Ryan replied in a serious manner: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to use the psychic ritual and Hood Eugen to find out what Lairus is looking for, and figure out Whether this is the direct cause of his madness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten's slightly decapitated:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If you don't apply, I will try a similar attempt after confirming that Hood Eugen is really crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main driving force behind Klein's becoming an extraordinary person is to study occultism, find a way to go home, have the opportunity to practice, and have strong self-confidence. He naturally does not want to give up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Captain, I have mastered this knowledge and I have some certainty about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I need 'Amanda' pure dew, 'Eye of the Eyes' potion and the aid of 'quiet pharmacy'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet Pharmacy..." Dunn chewed the name and confirmed Klein's profession. Sex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers that Dai Li said that this is a relatively rare but very useful potion in the psychic field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a dozen seconds, Dunn Smith rested on the back of the chair:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then you write an application and get the corresponding potion after going to the Chanis Gate. I don’t know if there is any finished potion. If not, I will receive the corresponding materials and mix the refining.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein replied with delight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn’t get up and he sat firmly in his chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teng sees the situation, raises his hand and squats down the forehead, thinking carefully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In the afternoon, it’s my turn to monitor the madhouse... We can’t go directly to Hood Eugen. No one knows whether the doctors, nurses, handymen and patients in the madhouse still have members of the psychological alchemy. No one knows. Whether the psychological alchemy club is also secretly monitoring Hood Eugen, our actions must be sufficiently secret that we cannot reveal that Dust Guderian has become a matter for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...We go in the early morning, secretly sneak in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I will stay by the side, guard against accidents."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the best! If Hood Eugen is just a fake madness, I use a psychic ritual against him. It doesn't mean turning into the zoo and dancing in front of the tiger... Klein puts down his heart and sincerely says:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Captain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and turned to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the title of the magazine that he had swept in front of the captain in his eyes: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doningsman sap in the rainforest of the Southern Continent has a significant effect on promoting hair growth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Kline pityfully withdrew Looking at the door, the door came out of the captain's office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, he flashed a fun idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the extraordinary is not so troublesome, If the old Neil is still there, he will probably suggest designing a ritual magic to give the goddess pray for help. As for whether or not he will grow up with body hair and become a curler, that is another problem... and the goddess will What is the reaction? Change it to me, I will definitely say: MMP...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea suddenly made Klein's happiness sorrowful, sadness filled with comics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He entered the civilian staff office and sat down to the Aksson 1346 mechanical typewriter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dunn Smith signed the stamp, he took the application and went deep into the aisle, along the aisle of the gas light, step by step to Chanis door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, Klein thought of a question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be his first time After entering the mysterious gate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what it will look like after the door..." He implicitly expected to speed up his steps and came to the black that looked open and gave a look. In front of the iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for a few tens of seconds, he did not hear the footsteps, and saw the open door with the inscription of the seven dark sacred emblems open and squeaky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chanis Gate was so open that it could only be stopped by one person, and Klein saw the nearby scene with the light of the gas lamps on either side of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a veteran old man with deep wrinkles and thin hair. He wore a black classical robe and carried a horse lantern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dim light of the candlelight shines through the glass, and the face of the old man’s expressionless face is dark and staggered, so that his light blue eyes seem to freeze for thousands of years. Ice cubes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"File." He snorted and spit out a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw the old man, because at the end of the twilight, he and his companions will come out of the Chanis Gate, pass the duty room, turn To the Church of St. Serena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are old nights, volunteer internal watchers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Klein, there are five such guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my application." He handed the documents in his hand to the old man in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internal keeper with a pair of light blue eyes raised the lantern and carefully read it again. After confirming it, he retreated to the side and let Klein pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slowly entered the Chanis Gate, and before he could look around, he felt an indescribably cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the cold of winter, but the coldness of the people who are still trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up, Klein saw a candlestick on the wall and saw a silver candle with a pattern carved, and their burning flames It has a blue color and no shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caretaker closed the Chanis Gate and became extremely quiet around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is in front of a wide aisle, paved with old slate aisles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are fans on both sides of the aisle, which are marked with the words "material", "syrup" and "data". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the aisle, there is a step down, which extends into the darkness, as if it is leading to the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be different seals for different seals, which are said to be divided into several layers... I don’t know which layer of St. Serena’s ashes is placed... Klein had just adapted to the brightness behind the door, and suddenly felt that there were invisible things in the air that swept through his skin, one by one, and cold into the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shuddered and couldn’t help but open the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he saw the surroundings, and after seeing the entire Chanis Gate, it was filled with a black thin line, they swayed gently, sometimes huddled, and sometimes extended. It was dense and there was no blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...this is the seal behind the Chanis Gate? Klein nodded invisibly, converging his thoughts, and followed the keeper into the "drug room" behind a thick stone gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, he found the "Amanda" pure dew, the "Eye of the Eyes" potion and the "quiet potion" based on the initials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two he have seen, the latter is still in contact for the first time, only in the translucent glass vial, there is a blue liquid in the light, light It is to see, it is like returning to the mother's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a label on the bottle that indicates the date of manufacture and the prompts that are valid for six months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, I can use... Klein put away three small bottles of potion and left the Chanis Gate with the caretaker, out of the coldness to the soul. The feeling of being away from the strange experience swept by a black line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
