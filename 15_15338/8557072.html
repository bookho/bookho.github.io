			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you delve into it, the high probability will lead to "redemption", even a hidden "red angel"... just a few times, I am The edge of the cliff danced... Fortunately, I restrained the impulse and pressed the curiosity about the strange situation in the lime restaurant and the telegraph office... Kline took back the sight and felt that the "sun brooch" could not avoid the shackles behind him. A layer of cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the event of the "real creator" coming, the unknown, unexploded situation is even more horrible, at least Klein can't help but imagine now, if I opened the door of the telegraph office, or went around, turned the window and entered, what would I see, what happened?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept filling each A strange, terrible scene that scares me off. At the same time, he decided to wait for the sun holy water to give passengers who had eaten in Banxi Port last night, to avoid hidden dangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Elland noticed the abnormality of German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think of a past event." Klein used the "clown" ability to make the facial expressions still normal, and the heart was glad that there was no risk last night, and now it is also smooth. Left the Banxi port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one idea for the secrets of the "redemption rose" and "king of angels" hidden here:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Hurry up to report! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not report them to the New Year in 1351? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you choose to hide, wait until you have a high enough sequence and enough strength to explore and gain the corresponding benefits, then what happens in the middle, dangerous Being detonated in advance, or the cults still remain, killing one innocent passenger, Klein feels that he will be very guilty, carrying a heavy burden, so that the distance is out of control is very close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the report is also about ways and methods. Klein is not stupid enough to tell Elland directly or write an anonymous letter to the Storm Church, which will lead to a lot of The trouble, first of all, the official will definitely investigate the background of German Sparrow. Many things will be debunked if they are thoroughly explored. Secondly, the current identity may be exposed to the “redemption rose”. The pursuit of the "king of angels". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein intends to use the "world" to mention the anomaly of Banxi in the two days when the Tarot will be held, and the "fool" will be lightly drawn. "Redemption Rose" and "King of Angels", as the relevant people of the Storm Church, "hanging people" naturally understand what to do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be his chance to make a contribution! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the blood of the immediate descendants of the Medici family, Klein did not consider it because he and Miss Sharon did not rescue the evil spirit in the underground remains. Thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Greman. Sparo is obviously not willing to mention his past, Ellan laughed, pulled out a black wooden box, lost the past . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein reached out and caught his doubts with his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fisherman’s jealousy can be used to make items that are useful at sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The extraordinary material on the fisherman... 150 pounds up... The captain is very generous... Klein almost forgot how Golman Sparo would react at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, in playing, he is also quite experienced and immediately sinks his face:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I save you not for remuneration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erlanhaha smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I am giving you this, not to reward your rescue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are friends? I saw that my friend didn't have similar items and helped him make up the short board. Isn't it normal? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes sense to make it completely impossible to refute... Klein held the black wooden box, silenced for a few seconds, and finally nodded.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aylan yawned and took off the boat-shaped hat on the head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to go back to the room to add some sleep, see you at noon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein waved his hand and led Daniz all the way to the outside of Room 312. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that Donna and Denton had gotten up early and waited at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Sparrow, what is in your hand?" Donna asked curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not speak, directly opened the lid of the black wooden box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a layer of black velvet in the middle, with a round jewel-like transparent object in the middle, and the blue water-like brilliance layering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The day, the fisherman..." Danton thought for a while and said, "Hey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, under Kline’s eyes, Daniz opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna stepped in with a light footstep and extended her hand behind her back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She holds a thick stack of cash, between £10 and £5. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My father, mother, and Uncle Reeves, and Uncle Dimudo, let me hand over to you, £150!" Na sweetly smiled. "They said that this is not enough to express their gratitude, just to add the materials you consumed, the amount... are those expensive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Fortunately." Klein thought about it and received a thank you note of 150 pounds, lest the ordinary people such as Uldi would be upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Uncle G. Sparrow puts cash and black wooden boxes into his pocket at the same time, and Donna sighs with the task of finally fulfilling her parents' confession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly entered the state, retrieved the real feelings of coming to visit, curious and a little scared to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Sparo, what are the monsters last night? Are the ghost stories true? Are you born to jump out of the flames and let the light fall? This is magic, Or witchcraft?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stopping, you have too many problems... Klein, who can’t stand the heat, took off the “sun brooch” and threw it On the desk in the living room, and replied casually: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is called extraordinary ability, obtained through some rituals and potions.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many ghost stories have prototypes, and last night's monsters were created by evil rituals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Other things you ask him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein squinted at Daniz . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s amazing..." Denton and Donna also sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, then, Donna’s eyes opened brightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Sparo, You are the same as the 'Superman' described by Russell's Emperor!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We, can we also become people like you through rituals and potions?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denton focused on the words of his sister, and both of them had a strong expectation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Donna found that Uncle Gilman Sparo’s eyes were a little more faint.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, she saw this The magical uncle's mouth opened and tilted up, revealing a strange smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s voice said in a low voice:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not something that is worthy of envy and expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you choose this path, you will always be with danger and madness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can win them a hundred times, a thousand times, but as long as you lose once, it will be like the fallen bishop. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the talk, he relied on the cane, took off his dress, and rolled up the sleeves of his shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His one arm has become dry and wrinkled, as if the old man was over a hundred years old, the other one is transparent and colorless, and can directly see the blood vessels under the skin , muscle and diaphragm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, his face grew a dense pale granulation, scared Donna and Denton stunned and slammed back and slammed into the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein with a small granule of his face keeps the upper slant of his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See clearly Have you?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is, crazy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No... Donna and Denton almost lost their senses, stumbled and opened the door and ran out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;After a few steps, they are difficult to fall to the ground in a balanced manner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s terrible and terrible..." Denton kept whispering At this time, they heard the sound of closing the door of Room 312.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calm down, I can't think of it and can't help but think about what Mr. Gilman Sparo had just said: one grain of granules occupied every inch of skin on the face, arms or wrinkles or transparency, no more than yesterday The night monsters look good.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, she remembered the other’s eyes and remembered the phrase “This is crazy.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes suddenly blurred, tears could not stop falling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Donna Donna, what happened to you? "Denton was scared by her reaction, and she was afraid of forgetting herself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna sobbed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just, I just feel good, so sad."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;312 in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi saw that Klein had returned to normal and couldn’t help but snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "In fact, there is no need to scare children like this, they will let them have nightmares, and tell them that it is dangerous to take the potion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He voice just When I fell, I saw a hardwood cane full of blood and stains flying over, accompanied by a sentence with no emotional ups and downs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz reached out and smiled and stiffened on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Queens, Luxury Villa in Earl Hall Inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey stood on the second floor of the white gold railing, watching the servants on the first floor come and go, busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the custom of the Kingdom of Lun, the aristocrats who have a fief will leave Beckenland one week after the New Year’s dance, return to their territory and enjoy the pleasant countryside or castle. Life, until June, will come back to the capital and start day-to-day socialization. Of course, Earl Hall, a real-name aristocrat and big banker, must go to and from the two places to deal with affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "moving" is not an easy task. Many things have to be sorted out in advance, and some servants bring them back to the manor or the castle in advance. When everything is ready, the owner We will embark on the journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Tarot party is over, I should sit back to the steam train in East Cheshire... I hope that the vampire can really get it. The fruit of the tree of the elders and the blood of the mirror dragon allowed me to become a "psychologist" before leaving Beckland... Audrey thought and thought divergently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the Countess Caitlin came over and smiled and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What are you thinking? Well...you are an adult. When you return to Bakerland in June, you can find something to do. Is there any plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
