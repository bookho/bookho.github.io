			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of this canned fish is really exciting...not only stinky, but also disgusting... it’s just biochemical gas! Klein was in the corner and slowed down for a dozen seconds before returning to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment before, he was too underestimated the smell of canned fish, failed to make the most effective response in time, did not use the "paper man substitute" on the spot or Create an invisible air tube and pretend that you are breathing underwater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he finally realizes how sensible it is to decide not to open canned fish in public! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein breathed out, slowly stood up, put on his luggage, and walked outside the dock step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s first impression of this city called Nasse is that the houses are mostly white, stone materials are widely used, and the second is that the location is not too north. But the temperature is quite cold, even if it is already April, it is still only a few degrees Celsius. The third is a lot of whaling houses. The huge white whale is dismembered into skin, meat, fat, bones and "grey amber". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter two are skirts that can be used to make a banquet dress. One is the top spice, whether it is incense or perfume, it belongs to the nobles. The luxury that we can enjoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the skin, meat and fat of the beluga, they also have their own uses, which can make clothes, become food, and refine oil. In Nasse, in the Gargas Islands, the cooking of beluga whales has formed a unique culture, with a variety of tactics and reputation outside the restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein passed by a whaling house and saw that the stripped fat was carried by the horse and drove to a factory that smoked black smoke not far away. It is a refinery with the characteristics of Gargas. The fat of the beluga whale will be refined into whale oil, put into bottles and barrels, and become a superior fuel and some industrial blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very special... Klein’s mouth is breathless, and he stops by for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the port, came to the city, a burst of noisy Vesak language passed to his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who masters the source of the Northern Chinese language of Guuffsic, has long been familiar with the words of the northern barbarian, and he has heard the past and saw the past. The tall, gray-haired people held banners and marched on the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forefront of the banner clearly states their resistance requirements:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whales, we need sustainable development!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗...Klein is almost out of order, and immediately believes that the concept of "sustainable development" is 99% Russell the Great "invented". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking around, he looked at the banners behind him, and the purpose of the parade became more apparent:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Walking for survival, not for fun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Human is no more noble than beluga!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The greedy demon leaves Ness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, police officers in gray uniforms are blocked with shields, long forks and sticks. The march of the parade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short quarrel, the scene quickly became intense. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of young people in the parade threw out the open canned fish, throwing out the spirits with the cloth strips and being lit, and the police did not Restricted, pushed back, and the shield hit the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pinched his nose and looked at the fire on the street, and found that many pedestrians had no feeling about it, except for a small number of onlookers. I am going to the destination normally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this is what Nass often happens... Is the parade a conflict? It is worthy of the Fossac Empire... Klein muttered two words, bypassed the street, and found a hotel to stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still uses the name of the name "German Sparo" to register, and he is not worried about the "sickness of the disease". Let the Church of the Night God treat him as a "faceless man" because he would not go to the whaling route to find mermaids who have become goddess believers, and intend to go straight to the dangerous area in the easternmost part of the Sunia Sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the security issue in the Gargas Islands, it is even more difficult for him to worry about it. This is the colony of the Fossac Empire. The only legal religious organization is the God of War Church. They are very hostile to the Church of the Night Goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was originally worried that there would be a lot of "faceless people" here? - Going to the next door to enjoy a whale meal can hit seven or eight Then, after careful thinking, this possibility was ruled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because the extraordinary people of the "Divination" approach are rare in themselves. More than the sequence 8, Klein has only encountered three, and the second is the sequence. The extraordinary people of 6 are not wild grasses everywhere, even if they belong to the pirate paradise, the prize money of 5,000 pounds is also a rare animal, and the third is "no face" to prepare, they will go to the whaling ship to find the mermaid, or start The goddess of faith either sinks to the bottom of the sea or acts as a researcher, or has a high IQ, seizes the opportunity, successfully advances, leaves safely, and rarely stays in the Gargas Islands for too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole Nance, except me, "no face" will not exceed two... Klein sorted out the clothes, no hurry to contact "the star will be "Jia De Li Ya, came to the street in a good mood, looking for food according to the content of the trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White whales, fried whale steaks, whale fish oil, grilled whale meat... Klein is like an authentic traveler, changing three restaurants. Taste different foods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not bad, quite characteristic, the fishy taste is not heavy, but it is very appetizing and tempting... oh... Klein licks his mouth and comes On the street, the street lights were found to be sparse, but the light inside the houses on both sides was bright, which somewhat eased the darkness of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind came through the ocean, blowing Klein up and pulling the collar high, the blue sleeves converge to the brilliance, deep The ground is inlaid on the wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to the ring, the item of the cuff is more in line with the image of the person of the German Sparrow, so Klein did not blame the "artisan" "Change the demand without authorization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harmonica that solidified the Summoning Spiritual ritual is exactly the same as Klein’s intention. It can be used for one and a half years, and the body is silvery white, exquisite and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When getting the harmonica, Klein has imagined such a picture: a crazy and powerful adventurer in a quiet night, under the deep moonlight , leaning against the edge of the ship's side, playing a sad melody with a harmonica. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this harmonica has no sound at all, and can only be used to summon Renee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisibly shook his head, and Klein steadily marched on the empty, cold Nassis street and returned to the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He adjusted his state with sleep. He came to Gray Amber Street the next morning and entered a grocery store called "Frenzy Whale Dance." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the white-haired boss who is taller than himself, Klein slammed the counter down and used the words of Fossac:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buy whale oil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss’s face was criss-crossed, but his body was only wearing a layer of whale skin. The jackets produced, the light-colored patterns have a strange beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much?" The boss is drinking a lot of spirits, not to manage the messy placement of the goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One and a quarter barrels." Klein replied according to the agreed secret code. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss’s action of drinking slowed down and brought the brown-green bottle to the counter:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Would you like a bite? The most pure Nipos, the mistress of all Fossack men!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a distilled spirit of Fossack. Made with potatoes or grains, it is known for its high degree and is as stimulating as the flames. Compared to Sunia blood wine, it is quite cheap and popular with ordinary Fossacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Klein shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss smiled low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of man does not drink Nibos?<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are there only ladies left in Lun? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
