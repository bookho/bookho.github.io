			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the northern part of the Kingdom of Lun, the coolness of the wind in September was a bit chilly, and after the cemetery, there was a sense of coldness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was blown up and made a clever move, and Horan returned to his heart and laughed and said to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "There is still some secret in this crossing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it seems that at least twice, I can't 'resurreate' I don't know if it's used as a bologna, it's useless to recover. It doesn't work..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few tens of seconds, Klein tied the buttons and found that he was wearing the latest shirt and tuxedo suit, but at this time they all had a lot of dirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Banson, Melissa really didn’t know how to save... He subconsciously came up with such a thought, put his hand on it, stood up and found The power of the "clown" has not disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Best brother...the best brother...the best colleague..." Klein looked at the tombstone, silently reading the inscription above, and suddenly A sour, seems to appreciate the grief of Melissa and Benson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be more difficult than I saw the death of the captain... He sighed, took his eyes back, knelt down, and re-closed the coffin board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the thoughts are still somewhat sloppy, Klein knows that he must deal with the scene as soon as possible and cannot be discovered by anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resurrection is not something that normal people can play! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you let the night, the punisher, or the heart of the machine know, Klein believes that he will not have a good ending, of course, if this is the earth, he served If you eat a "lawyer" or "swindler" potion, you can fool into "the grace of God" and "the person who redeems," but the world has a true God and will respond to the true God of the ceremony! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Filling up the soil again, covering the slate, Klein took his hands and stood up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation, no special, he is like a gentleman who squats at night, the only wrong thing is that the tombstone The person in the photo is exactly the same as his looks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process just now, his inspiration perceives the existence of the "Azick copper whistle", so he dug it out and wiped it clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Klein did not intend to summon the messenger immediately, he decided to first figure out the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raising his left hand, Klein saw the citrine pendant still wrapped around the wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a funerary?" He laughed at himself, dismissed the spirit, looked up and looked around, his expression gradually condensed, "...the captain should also I am buried in this cemetery..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He changed two directions in a row, and finally used the spirit to determine the position of Dunn’s grave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While looking through the moonlight, after ten minutes, Klein saw the captain’s black and white photo: gentle, high hairline, gray eyes Vagueness can be reflected, and there is often no difference in peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the photo is Dunn’s name, date of birth, date of death, and epitaph:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The true guardian;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most trustworthy companion;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forever Captain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at it, the line of sight didn’t know why it was blurred again, and vaguely returned to that day, saw the captain’s side over and squeezed himself. The lower left eye, the voice is mellow, and the tone is easy to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We saved Tingen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He stood there like a statue for a few minutes, and smiled and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, your mental state is definitely not very good that day, all said If you are not out of control, you can 'take' the words into the dream. He is a 'sneak secret person'. You are a 'nightmare'. You can’t take the extraordinary characteristics left by him. Well... you were all at the time. I haven't asked if I have any powerful means of attack, trust me, or forget this thing... but you must have guessed something... I only took one seal and said it was for Leonard. You I think I should be able to think of it with my toes. I have an extra, powerful attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come here, Klein paused and shook his head and sighed. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what I am doing now, maybe it's just a evil spirit that climbs out of hell and wants revenge..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he suddenly can’t say it, tears drop across his face, finally, he Screaming and shouting:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain...we are too reluctant to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Feeling full of cold and chilly winds, Klein raised his hand and wiped his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recovering the silence, he found a hidden place, and took four steps back into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He relies on divination to figure out who killed him that day and figure out the real murderer behind the scenes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it’s already in front of me, I’m sure I can divinate a certain amount of information... Klein’s lips are close to her, seeing the majestic palace and ancient mottled The long table has not changed a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat in the position of a "fool" with a yellow-brown parchment and a round belly pen in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the outside body is in a state of little protection, Klein did not delay, and wrote a divination statement with a little thought:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Killing me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He meditated seven times, leaning back on the back of the chair, using meditation to enter the dream . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a gray world, countless light spots are flying and gathering, and finally merge into a picture:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of bright leather boots, a slightly pale hand, the casket of St. Serena held by the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of sight gradually moved up, and Klein saw a middle-aged man with short black hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wore a black double-breasted long dress, obviously licking one eye, his eyes were dark blue and black, and the facial features were like carvings, without the slightest wrinkles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture is broken, Klein wakes up from the dream, frowns slightly, and feels that killing his murderer is familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a diviner, he quickly confirmed why he felt familiar, because he had seen the photos and related descriptions of the other person on the wanted order! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This murderer is Ince Zangweier! The archbishop of the former Goddess of the Night, who had defected with the seal "0-08", was promoted to the "gatekeeper" who failed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's him!" Klein's mind flashed through countless pictures, and finally settled in the scene where the other side picked up the Saint Serena casket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, hey, hey, he reached out and tapped the edge of the bronze long table and felt that he wanted to understand a lot of things:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""The captain said that the extraordinary people who die normally will also leave extraordinary characteristics, they are gathered together, slightly equal to the potion without auxiliary materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, as long as you know the corresponding auxiliary materials, you can get promotion through the 'relics'. Of course, you can't take it out of order, it is easy to get out of control or go crazy."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ince Zangweier is the sequence of the 'Death' route 5' gatekeeper', he wants to be a high sequence strong, become a demigod, based on the actual situation of sequence swap, he has three choices, one is itself' Sequence 4 of the Death's Pathway, Sequence 2 of the 'Insomnia' Pathway, and Sequence 4 'The Demon Hunter' of the 'God of War' Pathway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Saint Serena is a saint, not sequence 4, or sequence 3, and her ashes correspond to one of the two potions... Ings. Zangweier, as the former archbishop, must know exactly which one, It is also very clear what the auxiliary materials are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He planned these things, the real purpose was to get the ashes of Saint Selena and promote them' The sleepless person's route 4?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, the skull of the descendants of death, perhaps the material needed for special rituals, after all, was originally the 'death' route." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, his goal is more of a captain than me. ...it really is behind the scenes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you understand this, Klein writes the corresponding divination statement, puts the spirit pendulum, and makes the citrine pendant Hanging on the surface of the paper, almost touching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After meditation, he opened his eyes and saw the citrine pendant spinning in a clockwise direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the pre-information is sufficient and the divination is successful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that Ins. Zangweier is really for the ashes of Saint Selena, in order to promote the sequence 4, I have planned a series of things! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein once again tapped the table and thought about another question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zangewell It’s just the 'gatekeeper' of sequence 5, it’s impossible to make so many coincidences on his own, so that Mecoos ​​will visit the night squad at the right time according to the 'arrangement'.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, is that the ability of the seal '0-08'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Its shape is an ordinary Feather pen... Its role is to write down things that are destined to be realized?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it shouldn't be that simple...others, Ins. Just write down 'Saint Serena's ashes grow wings and fly to the hands of Ins Zangweier' and you can wait at home..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This must have certain restrictions..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'0-08' has mostly no direct attack capability, otherwise Ins Zangweier For a long time, I’ve been tempted by the Chanis Gate in Tingen. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This item at the top of all seals can make people unconsciously follow its description? That is the time The reason for the coincidence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, '0-08' is really terrible, even the sacred sacred mego It's arranged... No wonder the '0' seal is very dangerous, with the highest degree of attention, the highest level of confidentiality, can't be inquired, can't be rumored, can't be described, can't be snooped..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein stopped the action of tapping the edge of the table and made a divination for the guess. Unfortunately, the information was incomplete and failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that time has passed for a few minutes, he intends to return to the real world as soon as possible, so he no longer divulges his thoughts and writes the penultimate "Divination Statement": Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ins. Zangweier is currently in the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the seal "0 The existence of -08", because Ins. Zangweier should have become a demigod, Klein could not directly divinate the specific position of the other party, only to enlarge the scope and make a vague "inquiry." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if there is no mysterious space above the fog to eliminate interference, even if the fuzzy "inquiry", he will certainly be divination failure, can not get the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying on the high back chair, Klein silently recited the divination sentence seven times, once again into the dream, into the gray world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
