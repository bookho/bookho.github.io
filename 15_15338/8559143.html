			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Klein’s salute, the black-haired simply draped Jiadelia’s eye-catching purple adduct seems to have turned into an abyss that can absorb the soul. The mysterious taste is more obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw that the surface of the spirit body of Gelman Sparo's etheric body is dark and pure, subtle, undercurrent, and endlessly changing. ;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw that Greman Sparo’s left hand was bright and bright, but it was stained with rich and unblemished blood;<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw a splendid brilliance in the sleeves of German Sparrow, silvery white flowing in the left pocket, bright colors, as if connected to the illusory overlapping spiritual world, surrounded by clusters of illusory winds Many things faintly concealed;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw the right hand pocket of Gilman Spalo, intertwined with green and black awns, with two gold, silver and bronze colors The chest position is gray and deep, like a decaying death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four magical items, extraordinary artifacts or spiritual spells in ten units... "Stars above" Jia Delia's eyes are faintly swayed, forbearance Can't stop closing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded jokingly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, Mr. Sparo."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the veteran of the seven major pirate generals, even the veteran of the seven major pirate generals, she rarely encountered this kind of armed with extraordinary items to arm themselves to the teeth. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, she has not seen that she has not had more magical items, extraordinary artifacts and spiritual spells than this number, but there is a hidden organization behind her. There are several ships and thousands of pirates. Many things must be handed over. They must be distributed. They must be sold to maintain and strengthen their own power. The things that can be left in their hands are not too many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "not much" is relatively comparable, and can now be compared with German Sparrow, but Jia Delia will pass various exchanges, They become only two pieces - two strong enough to match the two pirate generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the brilliance of the different items, Jia Delia dyed a little dark purple eyes and vaguely saw that Gelman Sparrow was not real enough. It seems to be hidden in a thick shadow curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, this is why he gave me a sense of innocence at the Tarot Conference? His secret is not small, at least involved in the sequence of the saints, even the higher angels... Jia Delia does not dare to say, the dawn is no longer so deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, she laughed at herself and felt that she was a bit funny about the "world" speculation about German Sparrow:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy One who is involved in the sequence 3, even the higher angel, huh, this sentence is completely no problem, because he and I are members of the Tarot Society, sure I am involved in the 'fool' who is suspected of awakening the ancient gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After greetings to each other, Jia Delia has no chills, no jealousy, and leads Klein to the cabin entrance. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the stopped "Future" re-launched, drawn a long arc on the sea, and headed east along the whaling route, Ness The tension in the port dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the sailors came over, and Klein didn’t have any cramps. Instead, he looked around and said with a self-satisfaction: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Less than I imagined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The star above" Jia De Li Ya side At a glance, he responded simply: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s very dangerous to go east of the whaling route. Only Ludwell often runs there and seems to be looking for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to the future, other ships of the pirate group will not pass. Similarly, most of the sailors have been placed on other ships by me. The minimum number of people sailing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very sensible move...Ludwell, the "Hell Admiral" Ludwell? "Inverted Man" when he first mentioned him, It is said that he has begun to explore the eastern end of the Sunia Sea... Klein gently decapitated, did not say more.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the temperament of the German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He silently observed the surroundings and found that the decks, bulkheads, masts, etc. of the "Future" were covered with mysterious abstract symbols, and the whole seemed to overlap. Great ritual magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the "Golden Dream", it is a mysterious sailboat, but it has not reached the level of the ghost ship... and "the star above", "the iceberg It will be a little worse than the one that has become a pirate general for a few months. The "Black Death" has no unique place... Klein took back his sight and followed Jia Delia to the cabin entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is waiting for a man wearing a pair of trousers and a white shirt. He is about 30 years old. He is physically strong and sweaty, so that the bare arm is like a set. Layer brown sweater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears a rounded hat in the middle of the top, revealing a hearty smile, stretching the right hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"The mate of the 'Future', Frank Lee.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, Mr. Sparo. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franke Lee, a "toxin expert" who rewarded 7,000 pounds... Klein recognized each other.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that Galman Sparo did not have the habit of shaking hands with people, he bent slightly and turned his back: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franke Lee retracted his right hand and glanced at "the star above the" Jia Delia, smiling with a smile:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you seem to know me? Also, the photos I have taken have been on my order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't care about what 'toxin experts', I am a very friendly person, as long as I don't face those damn guys! My biggest hobby is to study the soil, Crop and variety hybrid technology, believe me, this is the future of mankind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the people of the Mother Earth Church do not believe it." The covert way was introduced to Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original person of the Mother Earth? The variety hybrid technology is quite good. Only when the output is improved, can we feed more humans and make the poverty limit higher... Klein looks at Frank Lee, and half is polite and half calmly said:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a good thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...you really are an adventurer who doesn't care about secular views! Very Great, great! There are too few people in your world like this!” Frank Lee’s blue eyes showed a clear surprise. “I just tried to mix bulls, cows and wheat together so that the calf can Growing up like wheat, it was almost sent to the trial court by the goddess church, the kind mother, they did not really understand your will!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crossing of bulls, cows and wheat... You demon... Klein found that the hybrid technique he understood and the other party’s mouth were not the same thing at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He keeps his expression unchanged, does not explain what to do, under the leadership of Frank Lee, who is soaring in enthusiasm, and shoulders with the "star above" Jia Delia Walk in the hallway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After stepping on the stairs and coming to the higher level, Klein was inspired and turned his eyes to the shadow of the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a dark twist, and there was a figure, a tall but pale figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skin on his cheeks is almost transparent, the bridge of the nose is uncoordinated, and the whole person has a feeling of illness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the second officer of our ‘Future’, Heath Doyle.” Frank Lee smiled and introduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reward is higher than you, reaching the "bloodless" Heath of 7,600 pounds? Klein quickly responded to the correct wanted order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heath nodded, and said hello, then silently retracted into the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a 'Royal Bishop'." Turned to the captain's room, Frank Lee spoke enthusiastically about Heath Doyle. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
