			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The county of East Chester in January is still very cold, often seeing snow, the branches of the trees are withered, the beasts are hidden, and lifeless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey led Susie, surrounded by the servants and maids, and turned around the collapsed ancient tower for several laps, but nothing was found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only stacked gray masonry and decaying wood, and the weeds and the bodies of some small animals can be seen in the gaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey originally thought that he could find a mural from the wall wreckage, interpret the origin of the ancient pagoda, and use the haunted beast to quietly practice "shock" and " The extraordinary skills of "psychologists" such as "freakish" and "soothing" made her very disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a small adventure... It’s just a simple horseback walk... She licked her lower lip, took the whip and went to the mount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halfway through, she was not too willing to ask the attendants and maids around:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Is there a legend about monsters nearby?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of waiters followed her from Beckland to the family castle to the manor, half of the locals Usually busy in the manor, the goal that Audrey asks is undoubtedly the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why she came to this manor is because the nearby area has historically worshipped the folklore of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young attendant sneaked at the noble and beautiful lady of the lord, boldly, stepping forward, said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are many terrible beasts in the depths of this forest. Every year hunters die there, but no one has ever encountered a monster.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the same as described in an ancient song we circulate here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He roughly recounted the song Specifically, it means: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Monsters are in your dreams;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dragons In your dreams;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The imaginary, great palace floating in the air is also in your dreams;<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where, you will have everything until you wake up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curious children, brave adventurers, go Go and look for the dragon in the dream... The attendant will hide the last lyrics, There are speaking out, because it will make people think that he satire Miss Audrey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon is in a dream...Imagined, the great palace floating in the air is also in the dream... Audrey carefully pondered for a few seconds, suddenly I feel that this ancient song is not completely meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon information she bought from the little "Sun" shows that "The Dragon of the Dream", Angel Weide, imagined a floating sky out of thin air. The city, which has a huge temple pillar on top of it, supports a grand palace. Its name is "Liveside", which means the city of miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dream... The "audience" approach belongs to the soul dragon, involving the consciousness, the subconscious, the collective subconscious sea and the spiritual sky, no matter which aspect, it is inevitable In the field of "dreams"... This ancient song may really indicate what... "Liveside" does not really exist in the collective subconscious sea, exists in dreams? Dreams are purely spiritual... Audrey has flashed a lot of thoughts in his heart, and he has not been able to come back to the manor and he has not been able to come up with clear ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the room, she looked at the golden-haired big dog Su Shi, and suddenly had the urge to show off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi does not know the information of the dragon, certainly can not detect the peculiarities of this song... No, not proud, this is too superficial... and very It’s easy for Su Shi to discover that I have hidden the secret... Audrey’s waist back and forth a few steps back and forth, seemingly inadvertently asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, what do you think the song was really talking about? I always think it is not as simple as the surface."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi opened his mouth and didn’t know for a moment. How to answer, because she does not understand poetry at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought about it seriously: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Audrey, I am just a dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue Mountain Island jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of excitement, because of excitement, Karat has not slept, sitting in a wheelchair, going around and seems to have found another survival goal besides revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the rounds, he returned to the altar and wanted to pray again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers the contents of the "Ten Commandments" very clearly, knowing that he can not be called the name of the sea god, so he intends to pray in peacetime with a relatively vague "god" instead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close to the altar, his eyes suddenly straightened, because the items placed inside have an unusual atmosphere, for example, the dagger, the surface reflected It is not a red moon, and the silver electric light, for example, the leaves are more and more green, so that people only have the feeling of breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God has fallen... Karat’s mind has flashed such a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he has no doubts about the change of "Poseidon", and the embarrassing thoughts hidden in his heart are completely gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From God giving revelation, saying that it will be reproduced in the earth, it means that He wants to reshape the image... This layer of meaning is very deep, we used to I didn’t understand it at all... Karat slowly took a breath, and both hands supported him, solemnly, and bowed to the great sea god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, he took the wheelchair back to the residence of the High Priest, Edmonton and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t wait to tell these companions what happened just now, and can’t wait to share with them “God is like the sea”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night, 11:00 pm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat in the chair and looked at Daniz with a look of "falling ritual" without any expression, and remembered all the details in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the spirit world... He made a preliminary judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is a spiritual creature, as long as the description is no problem, it can be accurately positioned, and a language with a certain 'power' can be summoned directly, or They are spiritual, regardless of distance and scope.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a way, the gods also have such qualities, but sometimes they use ordinary Language prayers may also receive responses from them, of course, provided that they have become believers and have received attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The semi-god and half-human level seems to have some degree of blending with the spiritual world, so it is possible to point to them through precise descriptions and have the possibility of getting a response. However, there is a limit to the distance. Once they are out of range, they cannot receive the 'signal'... 'Poseidon' Cavitowa is an example.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' Lieutenant Iceberg's strong in this sequence, if you want to accomplish something similar, you can't do it yourself, you must rely on the corresponding gods, and provide accurate and unambiguous descriptions, and also have distance and scope restrictions. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just finished his thoughts, and the various objects on the altar floated, except for the three candles.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi’s body is shaking uncontrollably, and his expression is getting colder.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, he issued the “Iceberg Lieutenant” Female voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be an anger that is awakened by people... Klein thinks that Daniz has become feminine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He considered the following: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have found a way to 'blood above'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? "The character of Edwina Edwards who has returned to Deniz has returned to normal, that is, there is no feeling of normal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein succinctly said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They use the latest radiotelegraphy technology, I got the band and password information in 'White Bear'."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wireless, telegraph...Do you know this?" Edwina didn't seem to think that the expert in the field of occultation, such as Germano Sparrow, also mastered the common sense of radio communication technology. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein politely laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly understand."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina was silent for two seconds, with the help of Daniz’s mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do they find it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;refers to "above the blood" have they found the password and frequency band leaks? In theory, it should have been noticed, because their intelligence officer, Old Quinn, has already died in the hands of Mr., but it is easy for users to ignore security risks when the radiotelegram has not yet entered the stage of scale application. ... Klein did not make an absolutely positive answer: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But can try Give it a try. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as you can monitor the signal, the possibility of finding "blood on the top" is very big! As "Poseidon", although it is only a semi-god, it is difficult to " The things in the territorial sea are well known, but they can control the marine life and let them help people... Klein silently added two sentences in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aidewen Na Shen said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I asked Daniz to help monitor. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know the radio too well... Klein opens his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" it is good. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the ceremonial ceremony, Daniz felt very complicated and looked at German Sparrow to take out a small machine and corresponding from the bedroom. Supporting items.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this? He asked awkwardly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein said plainly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Radio ticker. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz opened his mouth and finally said a word:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Where did you get it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gave him a look:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Outside. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he threw the operating manual and band password information to Daniz, and he turned back to sleep in the bedroom.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is always busy with these things... Daniz feels that he understands something.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hard reading and Attempt, he finally mastered the use of the radio ticker, and lay back in the easy chair to sleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long I slept, he suddenly woke up and listened It’s a rhythmic squeaking voice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? Daniz rolled up and looked up to the place where the sound was coming.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the deep moonlight, in the dim room, the radio ticker was running on its own, spitting out illusory white paper.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...this is something? Daniz condenses the flame in his palm and carefully moves closer together.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene reminds him of the pirates often talk when bragging Those horror stories!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a problem with the radio ticker, connected with a evil spirit? Daniz decided to call the German in the bedroom immediately. .Sparo.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is close to the radio ticker and sees a few lines of ancient Fossack words on the illusory white paper:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
