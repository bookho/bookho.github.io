			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the suburbs of the North District, the three-story building of the medical school that was soon abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even at three o'clock in the afternoon, fog and stratus have made the entire Beckland dark and dark, just like a heavy rainstorm is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the run-down corridor, the cold light slanted and slanted through the window, making everything appear silent and sorrowful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey, who is here for the second time, is no longer as awkward and tense as before, with a surgical cap and a large mask on his head. Habitually observe the environment and observe every detail here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gregorian Viscount walked aside, gradually becoming a little scared, could not help but suppress the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "How do you feel a little weird here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will there be ghosts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As a mysterious lover who only walks into the circle with half a foot, the extraordinary phenomenon that he has truly seen is only the wall and opening of the door of Forth, and it is not certain whether the shadow of the soul is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not prevent him from fearing similar monsters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls glanced at him and held back his smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the gatherings are extraordinary. If there are evil spirits and ghosts, they must be very happy. This means material or servant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the Viscount of Glenlint Obviously relieved, she deliberately added one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I am only talking about the weaker ghost, the real shadow may be able to Let everyone here die silently, but want to run but can only go back and forth between the three floors, how can not get out, just like entering the maze."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hugh’s accreditation location is down:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I have encountered similar grievances and can’t escape in the cemetery for a few laps. In the process, Someone has been inexplicably turning back, and then suddenly died. If there is not an extraordinary person carrying a 'Sun spell', maybe you will not see me today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lai Linte viscount shuddered, busy side head to look out the window, at this moment, there are just a withered branch hit the glass blowing in the wind, uttered Qing Xiang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glylint almost screamed and panicked to the two extraordinary people of Forth and Hugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey endured the smile that was coming to his lips, quietly watching this scene, and thought to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen the "fool" of the gods, knowing the silver city of God's abandoned land, I heard about all kinds of horrible monsters in the dark, and what fears and shadows? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But...I haven’t really met the ghost yet, hey! Audrey, what do you want? This kind of thing is still not to be casually better! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless I have become a "psychologist", have the extraordinary ability to influence other creatures, or get magical items that suppress ghost monsters...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people couldn’t help but speed up and quickly arrived at today’s meeting place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the door, Fols found an opportunity to bend back and lean back to the ear:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You just did a good job, you can make a story so scary so quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see the Viscount Glylint The place that was not covered by the mask was too white to see other colors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twisted his head and replied abruptly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't make a story."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was what I encountered before I came to Beckland. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Fols snorted and asked, "Is that true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this good to deceive?" The puzzle of the face was covered by a mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls turned his head and looked at the two steps and suddenly trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Glalint, who had not wanted to stay in the horrible corridor, reached out and opened the door to the meeting place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the whispering voice echoing, the cement-cast floor is reflected in his eyes, and the frowning preservative taste is introduced into his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he saw a large pool in the center filled with transparent yellowish liquid, floating again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures are all naked, some are more complete, and some are stripped of half of the epidermis, which is tanned like a beef jerky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a corpse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A screaming male voice echoed in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze was followed by Glenlint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These eyes come from the white coats around the pool. They also wear surgical caps and large masks, only eyes and a few skins are exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glylint’s body swayed, just wanted to turn around and ran, but saw Audrey, Fols and Hugh’s nothing going through He, walked in, didn't pretend like a companion who came here together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breathed, Glylint almost nausea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back, only to see the corridors dark and cold, shadows, and could not see half a living person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another chill, Glylint was busy stepping up, catching up with Audrey and others, and found the place farthest from the pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, a white scorpion figure appeared, using a wooden pole with a hook next to the pool, pulling a corpse to the side, and directly to get the other拽 to the concrete floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused for two or three seconds, took out the scalpel and cut open the abdomen of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the deepening of the wound, suddenly a cold, hoarse voice came from inside:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The party begins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...Glylint reached out and held the mask on his face, his throat squirmed a few times and almost vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With various transactions or successes or failures, the party entered the middle section, and Audrey, who has been calmly observing, finally spoke:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want the 'audience' potion formula."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, she immediately felt a few eyes swept away, But quickly removed, not much to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds of silence, the transaction was aborted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At four o'clock in the afternoon, the sky is getting closer to the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can it be the same?" Glylint did not maintain the aristocratic grace, slightly leaning against the carriage wood, sighing in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This extraordinary gathering of people, left a deep impression on him, and made him feel that he was under great risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even then, he still didn’t buy the venom of the adult horned Pegasus and Crown Jellyfish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folsh secretly whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is normal, although Baekeland Germany is the easiest place to get materials, but if you can't participate in every extraordinary party, you will also find that you can't find the item for a long time. It either needs luck or patience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Viscount, you see, the 'audience' formula that Miss Audrey wants, there is no clue yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, it is met But there is no money to buy... Sitting next to him, helplessly thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey is relieved of Glenlint:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I go back, Look for it in my treasure house, maybe you want it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She brought the pituitary of the colorful lizard today, but did not encounter Farr The spinal fluid of the Smale rabbit, so just changed the cash of 320 pounds - this is the preparation for Su Shi's promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grelin features a bow, waiting to open, suddenly seeing sitting in a hurry, slightly frowning:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems like someone is following us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe in your instincts, what do you do now?" asked Forth around. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracking us? What do we have to track? I sold an extraordinary item and got a few hundred pounds of cash. Even if someone wants to rob, we shouldn’t be at the forefront... Although Glylint behaves like a rookie, we don’t... and The convenor of the party did a lot of things to protect the safety of the members, preventing someone from being tracked, unless, in addition, sending someone to follow him! Everything was normal last time, um, where is the difference between the two times... Audrey thoughts turned, suddenly there was an idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maybe I am buying The behavior of the audience's formula has attracted the attention of the psychological alchemists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not likely to arbitrarily sell the "audience" formula, with the follow-up must be fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a simple matter to introduce people. It is necessary to guard against the fact that the other party is a quasi-criminal, or a spy sent by other hidden forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not observe the target, without examination, the organization will soon be destroyed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, Audrey is a human being to Forth and others:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preparation for the attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pretend that no followers were found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can go back smoothly Go to Queens, don't care about the exposure of me and Glylint, you must hide and leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her green eyes swept past Glenlint Xiao smile added: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are a mystery lover who many people know, it is normal to find opportunities to participate in extraordinary gatherings, even if it is the official extraordinary And we don't doubt anything, because we are all just ordinary people, so they at most warn one or two sentences through other channels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I have sequenced 8...Hey, in order to get in touch with the psychological alchemy club, you have to take a little risk... The official extraordinary person should not stare at me just for the purchase formula, and should not be able to bypass the party organizer to track us. I want to believe my judgment! Audrey blew herself in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Viscount Glylint muttered and agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage went as usual, and circled several times. At the end, Audrey and others changed the one according to the schedule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, the tracker has never launched an attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a back door to the residence of the Viscount of Glacier in Queens. The two nobles returned in a normal way, and Firth and Hugh each left on their own skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, Audrey took the golden-haired big dog Su Shi and the accompanying maids, sitting in their own carriage, unobstructed from the main entrance. Leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the sound of the wheel rolling, she could not confirm whether there were any followers, but she could only spread her thoughts on her own:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count’s daughter is clearly unlikely to be a spy of any extraordinary force...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her past has no problem...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
