			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ringing the name of Frank Lee, the expression suddenly became a bit weird:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Know, he...he is a kind and pure person, but sometimes it is purely scary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really...gram Ryan let the position of the stairway, followed by the ringing of the bell, and said casually: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you familiar with him?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kano walked silently in front, and after a while he turned his back to the German Sparrow Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I It is a product of unsuccessfulness, full of various problems, always ridiculed, only Frank, a few of them, look at me with normal eyes, and treat me as a real person with his own soul..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did he leave the 'Goddess of God' church?" Klein, carrying the suitcase, knew it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kano came out of the clock tower and answered the direction while answering:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I don't know the specific reason.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is an orphan. He grew up in a monastery and really regarded the church as a family and mother as a mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He had a lot of strange thoughts, and he had the chance to become a bishop of the parish. The result was almost sent to the trial court for the reason of blasphemy."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing Frank said, because he wants to mix bulls, cows and wheat together... Frankly speaking, change it to me, and send him to the courtroom... ...the reason why the guy didn't have anything early, it must be because the sequence is not high enough, and there are only a few things that can be done... Klein sighed a few words, followed by knocking the clockman Kano into a street and came to the back of the church of San Drocco. Alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kano walked in front of an ordinary house and rang the doorbell, once every two seconds, three times in total. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the sound of the cymbal approached, and the door slammed open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately saw an old man wearing a black short coat and a strong cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is white as snow, his face has no obvious wrinkles, and his eyes are wearing a black eye mask that covers all his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Member, Mr. Gelman Sparo has something to visit you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rui Mr. Judge? He is Mr. Ricciard? Is he blind? Klein had only heard the sound before, but he was not surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard turned his side to the side and slowly turned his head to the position where German Sparrow was, hehe laughed:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I can only see you like this. I wake up this morning and suddenly have a hunch that I can't look at anything today. To prevent accidents, I have to wear a blindfold." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Still like this... I can’t compare this god wind... Klein is funny and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he understood the exact interpretation of the other party’s hunch, that is, don’t look at yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers that "The Mercury Snake" Will Anthony said that the extraordinary people of the "monster" approach can see something that others can't see, so He can only detect his own speciality, and when Admiral, who was in the city of Tingen, would see his own eyes, he would bleed his eyes and fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognis pre-existingly dangerous, wearing a blindfold in advance... Hey, if not, I am going to ask him what he can see... Ryan didn't force others to hurt themselves, converge on their thoughts, and instead asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have clues about the magical items I need?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is not yet." Mr. Rejoed smiled. "I went to Baiyam after I was hurt. I was lucky. I met the high-level transfer of the Navy and the Governor's Office. Rescued Roy Kim, but it wasted a lot of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I used this request for a help.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a friend who was exposed to the murals left by the ‘Destiny Angel’ and was riddled with misfortune and needed to be eradicated. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognis thought:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, you take me past Don't let him go out, maybe there will be an accident. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded and walked over the alley with a suitcase and seized the opportunity to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Member, what do you know about the 'desire mother tree'? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Klein's view, there are many contradictions in the life school and the rose school, and there should be a deep understanding between each other.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard held his cane and walked slowly to the side, not using other people to help and lead the way, just like wearing a blindfold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Desire Mother Tree' is the embodiment of the Rose School's 'Bounded God', but I suspect that the facts may be just right On the contrary, the 'Bounded God' is one of the incarnations of the 'Desire Mother Tree'. My reason is that ‘red light’ El Moria said that the sequence 0 of the ‘heterogeneous’ route is still empty, huh, you know the sequence 0? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know. "Klein responded succinctly, not guilty, not even saying that he still knows the net light brotherhood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognid "Hmm": "In short, No one knows the true identity of the 'desire mother tree', and it is not clear which way He corresponds, perhaps this is his true identity. In addition, I can provide some side information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The desire tree" and the 'primitive moon' oppose each other and seem to have irreconcilable contradictions, and because of this, the rose school is always hostile to us.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But sometimes, the relationship between 'desire mother tree' and 'primitive moon' is subtle, you may not imagine that the Southland has a witch king who worships the moon. 'Join the rose school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Seven Gods Church hates evil spirits such as 'real creator', 'original witch', 'cosmetic dark side', but more hateful of 'primitive moon' and ' Desire Mother Tree'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Similarly, the Aurora, the Witch Sect, the Blood Society, and the Morse Penance Society do not like the Rose School. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit interesting... "Desire Mother Tree" belongs to one of the two most isolated ones? Klein thoughtfully stopped a carriage Looking at the bell ringer, Kano sent the "Fate of Destiny" Ricciard up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately entered the carriage and told the driver to go to the hotel not far away. It wasn’t long before the carriage arrived at the destination, and Klein was about to get off the bus and suddenly heard a loud noise. The explosion of the bomb made the whole street obvious. Trembling, the debris of one side of the glass window fell to the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No... Is it caused by Anderson’s doom? Klein’s spiritual instinct tells him, This is the case, but the most unlucky hunter seems to have not died yet.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked out of the carriage and saw a large wall, flame and smoke on the second floor of the hotel. There are still survivors.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a figure is cluttering, standing in a ragged, muttering to himself <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was such a bold guy who traded arms in the hotel, or a new type of explosive, almost made me die unclear... my suitcase... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean looked down at the suitcase he was carrying, and suddenly it was great to be cautious.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He turned back and grabbed Rickard, and helped the destiny member to walk down the carriage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson had some sense, and he smiled bitterly: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, your bad luck is a big part of the responsibility... Klein nodded and said to Mr. Rejoed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is him." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard turned his head to Anderson, and the black eye mask covered all eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused for a few seconds, smiling slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me a gold coin." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?" Anderson suspiciously pulled out a Lun gold coin from the inside of the garment, and then laughed at German Sparrow, "My hometown The custom of sewing a small pocket on the innermost clothes and loading a few coins. I originally didn't believe it, but it was too bad recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that he handed the gold coin to Ricciard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richardt caught the gold coin, slowly closed the five fingers, and took it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, your bad luck has been lifted." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Anderson stunned and looked at the side of the German Sparrow, as if to say: This is fine? You won't find a liar? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is also a loss, but choose to believe in Ricciard, after all, this is a fate member. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard collects gold coins, hehe laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you get bad luck, too So simple, if you don't believe, you can go to the casino and try your luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It makes sense!" Anderson took a shot and immediately pulled the pedestrian and asked clearly. Where is the nearest casino? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he changed his clean and neat jacket back and watched Mr. Rejoed, who was waiting on the street, instinctively opened his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly stopped, forcibly shut up, and then smiled and thanked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the demigod was sent to the carriage, he moved closer to German Sparrow and smiled with emotion:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just wanted to say that although you are a blind person, it is really powerful in the field of destiny... Fortunately, I remember in time that he is a demigod."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say so, it is expected to become a hunter who was "deadly killed on the spot"... Klein did not echo the other party and said:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can tell me the clues about the pistol."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the "crawling hunger" limit, he still hopes to have one More conventional offensive magic items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson took care of his hair, hehe laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Baiam.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a friend I have known before, a very powerful adventurer. Tired of the unsafe life, he bought a few spice manors with savings, found a good girl to marry, and completely withdrew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He had a child some time ago, his thoughts have changed, and he hopes to give children a better environment, better education, a safer situation, so he plans to move Go to Beckland, where there is the best grammar school, the best public school.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, he doesn’t want to rent in Beckland, but Not ready to sell the manor that can continue to make money, the magical items on the body are just superfluous, so I am ready to sell the revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the time I was anxious to follow the treasure hunt to the sea, I didn't know if there was success, but I could take out nearly ten thousand pounds in one breath. Very rare, the transaction is not so easy to achieve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
