			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. "World" also got the potion formula and main material of "Ocean Singer", it is really amazing! "Sun" Dairik pulled his eyes from the parchment in his hand and looked at the gentleman at the bottom of the bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his heart, the degree of power of the "world" has jumped to a level, and it is already comparable to the weaker ones in the "six-member council". Now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Fols also has a similar amazement, and the feeling is getting deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembers that when she first joined the Tarot Society, the intuitive impression that Mr. "World" gave himself was gloomy and restrained. Apart from this, there was no other characteristic. In the past, he has shown the experience of experience, the extensive knowledge, and the ability to be fairly good. At first glance, it is the kind of extraordinary person who has experienced many things. It is second only to the "downside man" in the Tarot Club. Member of the gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original image is quickly set in the heart of Fols, and in recent months, the "Magician" found that the "world" has been refreshed again and again. Your own cognition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first heard about the very important news, and then sold a lot of extraordinary features in a short interval, making people wonder if he is an active and active in the mysterious world. The killer, feeling fear from the heart, accompanied by a certain joy, because it means that some commissioned to find "world" Mr. has a high success rate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the new member "Hidden" appeared, "Magic" Firth thought that the light of Mr. "World" would be completely concealed by the powerful lady. Who knows, he regained the "wind" in silence, so that everyone can not look straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously get the "Ocean Singer" potion formula, the corresponding main material and the "Light Priest" potion formula in a week, it is not like human beings can complete Things! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really amazing, I appreciate this seemingly dumb, ordinary, practically capable type, oh, I don’t know when I can become a Viscount. After the hunt competition, the winner's reward should be a gift that will give a bloody person an essential boost... "Moon" Emlin White soon turned his thoughts back to his own affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey was amazed by the fact that he was increasingly puzzled by the previous one:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Why did such a powerful "world" never collect the diary of Russell the Great? Hey, he is not like the "hidden" lady. It has been a long time since I joined Tarot. I still need to observe... He doesn't have no need. There is no need to collect Russell's diary to exchange the corresponding things from Mr. Fool... ...why didn't he collect it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did he submit it privately? Why do you want to be private? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vague agreement, Audrey feels that there is a certain connection between Mr. "World" and Mr. "Footer", but it is still uncertain. After all, there are still many possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "downside down" Alger was silent for a few seconds, looking sideways at the top of the bronze long table:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, I asked to communicate with the 'world' separately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come...Clean is quite Looking forward to beheading, and immediately shielding the senses of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger waited for two seconds, looking back at the "world" of German. Sparo Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I exchanged with the original island coordinates that are not known to others.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are not only many extraordinary creatures that have been extinct in the North and South continents, but also There is an ancient relic of unknown age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the beginning, I was discovered with Qi Lingus. At that time, we were not able to explore it in depth, but he found some traces and doubts. There is something very precious and very important hidden in the ruins, and its value is not worse than one of the cards made by Russell the Great.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" My strength is not as good as that of Qieringus. I don't know how deep he is. He can't know what he saw. He can only guess the situation from some words he casually said. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......"""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I also explored the dangers and discovered the original islands and ancient ruins. Before I thought that Qi Lingus had left the sea to solve the pirate general, it was also him... "The hanging man" is not a simple storm church member, he The past seems to be very complicated, hiding a lot of secrets... Well, the value of a pristine island is indeed not small. For a hidden organization, this is the cornerstone for supporting the growth of people... Klein manipulates the "world" to sink into the sink Attitude, trying to get more information from the "downside down".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing "World" did not refuse, but did not agree, Alger, who had calmed down, said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are semi-divine-level extraordinary creatures on it. The trace of existence, for you, should be of great value.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, I can swear to Mr. Fool's to ensure that there is no lying. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got the potion formula of "Mr. Master", I had to consider the acquisition of the corresponding master material. At the level of the gods, money can play. The effect will be much less, and it is most likely to get what you want with the barter. The place where the semi-god-level extraordinary creatures are important is also very interesting. The world is no longer hesitant, and laughs low.道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted Man" Alger did not immediately request the "Ocean Singer" potion formula, and said: <br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a precondition. I hope that when you first explore the original island, the companion is me. There is a 'fool' who looks at it all. I don't think you have to worry about what is wrong with me. Plot. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein considered it and let the "world" nod.:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, When going to a dangerous place, I will need some companions, I hope you have enough ability to keep up. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger was not angry with the other person's tone and relieved: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I hope that your first exploration will be after my successful promotion. Of course, if I get out of control because of the potion, this agreement will naturally be void. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "The World" replied inadvertently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted Man" Alger no longer swears, with the consent of Mr. "The Fool" Parchment with the original island situation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the edge of the sea in Roth...the overall area is not small, equivalent to a blue mountain island... Klein took the paper and quickly scanned it, figuring out exactly where the original island was.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly looked up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The potion recipe and master material are given to you at the end of the party. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. "Alge, who made the choice, no longer has any entanglement. He heard a lot of groaning in his heart, but the surface is calm and steady.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two exchanges alone At the end, the "hidden" Jia Delia retracted his gaze to the "world" and turned to the "magician" Foer: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Get 60 pounds for 60 grams. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurry... The "Hidden" lady is very efficient! Fols's surprise is a while.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After the party ended last week, she has received the blood crystallization of the octopus, paying £600 for this, leaving only £230 in deposits, counting the 150 pounds that I just received this week. The difference is 220 pounds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First lend some money to the emergency, she should have so much... If the promotion is successful, then make money! Earn money! "False silently took a breath: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, trade this time tomorrow. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Hidden" Jia Delia "Well", without a trace of water, looked at "Justice" Audrey:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spinal fluid of the black hunting lizard has been confirmed, 1,800 pounds, the fruit of the psychedelic bell tree has no clues. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is already very good, better than I expected, thank you, ‘the hidden person’. "Audrey sincerely thanked the company for not paying attention to the price issue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She recently discovered that the establishment of the "Antiquities Collection and Protection Fund" has another effect, It is possible to make the use of their own funds more subtle and less attractive, so that both father and mother can't detect the problem.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After confirming the two transactions, Guardian Liya looks around in a circle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there a clue in the blood of mythological creatures?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately manipulated the "world", and dumb laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does it mean pure mythological creatures?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure mythological creatures? Are there not pure mythological creatures? "Justice" Audrey and others are both confused and interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hidden" 嘉德丽雅愣一秒:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pure, also It’s the blood of an angel. A drop is enough.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t elaborate on it at the time, she thought that there would be no such high-end things in Tarot for the time being, unless Mr. "The Fool" is willing to help, and it is clear that Mr. "The Fool" does not need others to explain what mythological creatures are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have some clues, but I am not sure I can get it, and I have to wait for at least three months." Klein manipulated the "world" to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other members of the Tarot Club were silent, but did not expect that the "world" even the angel's blood has clues! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else can he not do? "Justice" Audrey, "Magic", Firth and others once again refreshed their impression of "World". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger suspects that "the world" is to borrow a drop of blood from the angel of "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief silence, I suddenly found that my ascension was not necessarily as obvious as the other members of the Tarot Club. Emlin asked: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My last commission, do you have any clues?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic" Firth Immediately open: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a suspected situation, I will trace it down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is full of motivation to work on her debts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the transaction, "Sun" Dairik made a request to purchase the crystals of the roots of the elders, while the tail of the lynx was in a special warehouse in Silver City. There is in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, he also purchased auxiliary materials such as Phnom Penh Sun Flower, which is a common thing that the outside world lacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rhizome crystallization of the tree of the elderly and those supporting materials are not a problem." "Moon" Emlin spirits swayed, "So, you can What is the exchange?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he last provided the fruit of the tree of the elders to Miss Justice, he knew where the rhizome crystallized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik thought: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A vampire corresponding to sequence 5 The extraordinary characteristics?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a rare monster in the depths of the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood!" Emlin said with a grin. "You don't have to worry, I will tell you what I want, and then tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not want to repeat the items from the transaction and the rewards of the hunting competition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Dairik, who has owed the "world" a debt, is quite calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a silence, "The Fool" Klein tapped the edge of the mottled long table and signaled the beginning of the free communication session. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: There is a question to say, why should I disassemble and change the idiom into a more cumbersome description, because the background of this book is Western, Therefore, I have tried to find a place where there is no abruptness in language style. In addition to Russell's diary and Xiaoke's psychological language, I try to change the idioms with more Chinese characteristics, so that the overall description is less fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was originally told that there was a few words in the water and a word of water. I can see that it was teasing and joking, so I laughed. There is no need to explain anything, but now it may be affected by people who say water. Actually, many people think that I am deliberately adding more words. I think that my attitude towards words is problematic. I have to come from two arguments. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
