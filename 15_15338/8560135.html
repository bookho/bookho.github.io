			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quiet hotel room, the dark and deep radio ticker instantly returned to normal, and the surrounding light was no longer gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was busy preparing for the ceremony, sacrificed it to the fog, and then had the mood to think about the answer he just got. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the clues provided by "Magic Mirror" Arrods, combined with Mr. Azick and "The Snake of Destiny" Will. Ryan initially had a plan for the next phase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not just because you want to take a break to return to Beckland, but to think of this metropolis as the main venue for a long time, See if you can steal the Antignus family notes from the Church of St. Seychelles in the Church of the Night God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no way, try to go to a similar path. If this doesn't work, you have to take the last road to the main peak of the Hornaces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... Back to Beckland, you can’t just use the identity of Sherlock Moriatti, unless you want to catch Ins. Or a faction in the royal family hidden in the dark, but when you contact an acquaintance or use steam to teach resources, you can change back to Sherlock Moriatti.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "In short, you have to use a new identity, and have a complete distinction with German Sparrow. For the time, don't go back directly to Port Pritz, and take a circle from Desi Bay. People can't find the origin. "Klein thought about turning, and soon there was a clear idea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After initially determining the direction, he wanted to extract blood and use it on the fog. Explore the "Grossel Travels", consider the Tarot Society in the afternoon, and lie back on the bed, rest and relax.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Future" steadily travels in the undulating waves, "the star above" Jia De Li Ya stands by the window, looking at the open to the invisible margin The scenery, while the front deck position, from time to time came Nina's impetuous voice, she was roaring Frank Lee to make a bunch of beef-flavored mushrooms that breed very fast to eat fish.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Delia sighed silently, raising her hand and pushing the heavy glasses on the bridge of the nose.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, her inspiration suddenly Touched, looked down at the desk, I saw that there were a few more yellow papers when I was there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Diary of the Great...She ended up The messenger came over..." Jia De Li Ya was delighted to turn around and pick up the paper that was not much more like the initial temptation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is three o'clock in the afternoon, Forcibly remembering those symbols, she saw the illusory crimson ray of tides drowning herself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A towering pillar propped up under the towering dome, "The hidden "Jade Liya saw a similar dark red glow, turning into a vague figure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not go to the fine, found that the nose has been naturally presented Out of the familiar glasses, it seems to be the perfect re-enactment of the outside world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, her eyes are aimed at the "Justice" lady, gracefully got up, tone softly Greetings to the Bronze Long Table: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon, 'Mr. Fool'~"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Audrey's recent mood is really good. After returning to the family castle, she successfully helped her mother, Mrs. Caitlin, to solve some of the actual ages. And the psychological problems of the physical state, got very good feedback, which led her to sum up more "psychologists" to play the code.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, the heaviest One is to help others solve their mental problems. She suspects that this is why the potion name is called "psychologist" rather than "psychologist." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missing "Justice" is very happy... Klein seems to be infected, nodding with a smile, it is a response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, he found that Mr. "upside down" seems to be very worried, seems to be hesitating and struggling, and has not made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the greeting of Miss Justice is over, the "hidden" Jia Delia looks to the top of the bronze long table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Mr. Fool, I have I collected three pages of Russell's diary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come...I don't know if the three-page diary specially selected by the "Mysterious Queen" will be of high value. The information, for example, the fall of the "Big Card" corresponding to the "Divination" approach, can provide me with another possibility... Klein is quite expecting, and the appearance is calm and natural: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good, you can think of a request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, 'Mr. Fool'." Jia De Li Ya's attitude can't pick up a little bit of grievances, and then apply for a diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing her performance like this, and thinking about her dreams, Klein is quite pleased, just like the teacher in charge of the class has succeeded in getting a student to become It’s just as sensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. 'The Hidden Person' provided the Russell's Diary for the first time. With her level and ability, there should be no way to collect it... Well, in the past, she was more observing. After being punished by Mr. Fool’s last time, she really integrated into our Tarot Club?” “Justice” Audrey combined with the “hidden” Jia Delia’s performance last week. A certain judgment. At the same time, she also noticed that Mr. "Down Man" is not too right today. He seems to be looking forward to what he is not giving, and he is quite a curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not wait too long, the three-page diary was completed and came to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Sun" Dairik and other members instinctively quieted down, not disturbing the reading of "The Fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On February 9th, today is Bonova’s birthday. He is already a healthy, strong, honest, kind young man. He is so religious. It has received the attention of the church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is congratulating me, saying that Bonova is sure to be a leader and a Holy Spirit, praising his faith is like that. Pure, innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should be very happy, but my heart has a sadness that is difficult to contain. I hope my children can be more human, more emotional, and more Do more of yourself, not the believers of the gods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But almost everyone thinks that Bonova is in good shape now, Marty. Erda is like this, Shire is like this, my aristocrats, my ministers are like this, only Bernard and I have the same feelings, she told me privately, she thinks that people should be more self-conscious, as long as they do not hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking about the words that Charato was born in Bonova, and the more and more premonitions I have when I stepped into the demigod, my mood More heavy, cute angel, huh, really a lovely angel.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this your defense against me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the way you try to control me?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you probably can't understand My inner pride, in my opinion, what about the gods? I can replace it! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On February 11th, contacted Charato again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since I got the note of Antignus, the leader of the secret society appeared less and less frequently, I don’t know how to plan secretly. Anything, anyway, He will not tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On February 12th, Bernardie made a magical item that suits her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will enable her to effectively avoid the shackles of the 'hidden sages', as long as they do not take the initiative to ask for a response, um, this thing seems to help The ruins of the gods in the easternmost part of the Sea of ​​Sonia are not affected by the slang of the 'real creator', where there is a high probability of hiding the secret of 'the land of God's renown.' <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, I just just make a small gift to send my daughter, there is such a powerful effect, Bernard, you are the most in the world. Excellent 'artisan'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
