			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compass!噗通!噗通! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s heart suddenly began to violently beat, it shrank into a mass, and swelled fiercely, causing the body to tremble slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, he almost forgot what he was going to do, what to do until the infiltrator’s figure suddenly paused, slightly side ears, as if to hear What changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood" fell from the brain, Klein restored his basic thinking ability, touched his hand under the pillow and took the wooden wheel of the revolver Gun handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hard and smooth touch came, his mood was fast and steady, and the pistol was pulled out quietly and silently, aiming at the infiltrator's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, he is not sure whether he can hit the other side. Although he has been able to stabilize the target before, the active person and the fixed target are completely different. The concept, he has not been arrogant to the extent of confusing the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he vaguely remembers a sentence from his last life, probably meaning that the greatest power of a nuclear bomb exists only before it is launched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this environment, the truth is the same, the best deterrent before the bullets are fired! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not pull the trigger, do not blindly fire, the other party will not be sure that he is a rookie, it is very likely that he can not hit him, he will worry, he will be afraid, He will consider a lot, so that he will add restraint to himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, one idea after another emerged, let Klein immediately have a decision, he is not the more critical and calmer kind of person, but early I envisioned the scene of encountering the monitor, and I expected to focus on intimidation and non-attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big idiom has an idiom that is prepared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein’s muzzle was aimed at the intruder, the thin man froze and seemed to have sensed something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he heard a voice with a chuckle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This gentleman Good evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin man’s hands were quietly held, his body seemed to be tight, and Klein sat down in the bunk bed and pointed his gun at his head. Ministry, the tone is as leisurely and natural as possible:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please raise your hands, turn your body, try to be slower, and frankly, I am a timid, People who are nervous, if you are too fast, I will be scared, I can't guarantee that there will be no accidental shots, yes, that's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thin man's hands were half-lifted beside his head, and he turned his body a little bit. The first thing to see in Klein's eyes was the neat black tights, and then the two thick and sharp brown eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein couldn’t see fear from his blue eyes, but there was a feeling of being pegged by a ferocious beast. It seems that if he was not careful, he would be Slammed over and tore into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held his hand on the handlebar and tightened his hand to make his expression calm and indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the thin man was completely right at himself, he raised his chin and pointed to the door, gently and gently said:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Let's go out and talk, don't disturb other people's dreams, um, move slower, lighter steps, this is the most basic courtesy of a gentleman..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin man’s cold voice turned and swept Klein, still holding his hands halfway, step by step toward the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the aim of the revolver, he twisted the handle and slowly opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the door was half open, he suddenly slammed and rolled forward, and the door seemed to be pulled by the wind, jingling and reclosing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm..." Benson, who was on the top, was shocked by this huge movement, stumbled and waking up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, the threat of fear, the hope of blush!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least the truth is true: this life flies.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The truth is true, the rest are lying, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long time, he will be alive..." (Note 1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This poem seems to have the power to relax and settle. Benson in the upper store and Melissa in the middle and other people stumbled and slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was quiet and almost yawned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin man who just got rid of the action is so agile, he did not have time to react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the closed door, he smiled and said to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may not believe it, my hair is actually a blank bomb."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevent the empty bomb with a false hit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Klein listened to the midnight poem and patiently waited for the end of the battle to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in a minute, the tranquility stopped like the moonlight on the moonlight lake, and the night returned to the deepest silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein silently slides the wheel, shifting the air away, waiting for the result to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is ten minutes, just when he was uneasy, hesitant to go out and check out, the door finally came to Dunn Smith’s calm and gentle Voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coke, Klein breathed out and raised the revolver Take the key, bare feet, carefully approach the door, silently open the door, see the black windbreaker knees, half-high hat, Enron, gray-eyed deep Dunn Smith standing opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backhand closed, he followed Dunn to the end of the corridor, standing in the faint blush moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wasting some time into his dreams." Dunn looked at the red moon outside the window and said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know his origins?" Klein relaxed a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunn nodded slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An ancient organization called the 'Minister' They were founded in the Quaternary, and the Solomon Empire, and some of the fallen nobles at that time, oh, the notes of the Antigonus family came from them, because a member’s negligence entered the antiquities market, and was Welch. Get, they have to send people everywhere to pursue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for Klein to ask, he stopped and said:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will catch some of their members in reverse based on clues. Well, not necessarily good results. These guys are as good at hiding as the mice in the sewer, but at least they will Understand that the notes of the Antigonus family are likely to have been obtained by us, or have mastered the key clues. As long as they are not very critical and very important items, they will completely abandon this action. This is their philosophy of survival. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...if pen Crucial very important? "Klein asked, worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng Enxiao did not answer, but instead said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the 'Missing Club', We know very little, this time to success, thanks to your cleverness, this is your credit, then consider the possible, hidden dangers, and after the inspiration is improved, help in finding notes, you have An opportunity to choose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The chance of choice?" Klein vaguely guessed what, breathing was subconsciously heavier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den converged with a smile, solemn and serious expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
