			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olavy is in the northeast of the Rhodes Islands, not far from the straight line, but the safe waterway is winding around, adding a few hundred nautical miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was originally a pristine island with many extraordinary creatures. It was not human. After the hunting era, the Kingdom of Lun used it as a prisoner’s exile. Let the island of Olavi gradually have villages and towns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the islands on the east side were found to be colonized one by one, the convenience of the waterway and the richness of their natural resources attracted many new immigrants. Bustling port city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the lighthouse is so so warm in a dim environment that guides the passenger ship into the port and anchors at the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally, thanks to the red moon and the fate of the fate." Fat pharmacist Dirkwell jumped off the last step and stepped on a solid concrete floor. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seriously speaking, in addition to fate, you mainly have to thank the "fool" and "Poseidon" for your care... Klein has a leather suitcase and ordered it. Civilization stick in the palm of your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell 揣 揣 揣 “ “ 概率 概率 概率 概率 概率 概率 概率 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指 戒指Go straight to the church of San Drocco and enter the magnificent clock tower that boldly uses red, blue and yellow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the clock tower, Kano has a small room of his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚,咚,咚,Dakwell knocked three times in a row and couldn’t wait to hand over the items in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops, the brown wooden door opened, and the man in the room was tall and slightly awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks like he is about forty years old. The five senses alone, without any problems, can be combined, but full of disharmony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just glanced at it and found that his eyes were high and low, the two nostrils were big and small, and the left muscles were slightly loose, causing the corners of the mouth. It’s a little drooping, and the right side is just the opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kano’s legs are obviously long and short, and the arms are thick and thin, and the whole person is extremely asymmetrical and extremely ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are?" Kano, wearing a black robe, looked at the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the bellman Kano?" fat pharmacist Dakwell cautiously asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kano has a high mouth and a low-pitched smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am as ugly as I am There should be no second one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really." Dakwell nodded very honestly and immediately smiled. "I can see, your mentality." Very good, in fact, for men, the appearance is not important, and the ability to be strong is the key point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, you have never seen this real Ms. Yan’s ladies... Klein, who has experienced the flow star era, sneered at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kano’s expression was gloomy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t want to discuss this.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have problems with that? It doesn't matter, I have all kinds of pharmacy, there is definitely a problem that can cure you..." Dirkwell hasn't said When he was afraid of being killed by Klein on the spot, he stepped forward and blocked half of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein said low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a student of Roy King."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have already guessed that Roy Kim described his characteristics." Kano let the road open and asked the two to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His room is very small, with only one bed and a cabinet that can make a dining table, and the bathroom is on the ground floor of the clock tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My teacher asked me to hand over the items to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kano opened his eyes and saw that the scorpion was facing up at 4 o’clock, and it was obviously relieved. Ke Weidao:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not as unreliable as your teacher said, you can see that you have not tried to use it, this will wake it up, let It understands that it is no longer sealed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The fat pharmacist is red and honest, "it's just quiet now, one or two more The hour will turn by itself, and you'd better find a way to re-seal it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kano's face twitched:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"又?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, this, I accidentally dropped it to the ground, then it just, it will live a little bit. ......" Dirkwell instinctively wanted to take a look at the owl Harry, but found that the other party did not follow up, stopped at the bell tower and started to guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kano’s eyes are obviously wide, and his body is almost straight:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How are you? Arriving here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, the student Roy Kim should have been killed by the blind man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell is busy pointing to the German Sparrow Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This gentleman, he is a powerful adventurer, providing the most effective protection and short-term method of sealing the dice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What method?" Kano asked, blurter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trade secrets."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kano’s face changed a few times, and he held a hand with his chest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I thank you on behalf of us. Help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His employment price is £1,000 Add a request, we ask him to help him find a magical item with strong aggression and negative effects, he will buy it at a reasonable price.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forehead, I only have a little more than 300 pounds, so I only paid so much in advance, and the rest can only be up to you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kano silently finished listening The corner of the mouth moved: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only have more than 100 pounds..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran No one spoke in the bell ringing the room, the wind outside passed through the cracks, boasted in, and passed the three Face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Kano once again said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, Mr. Ricked, I will take you to see him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that we trust us relatively much. After all, a fate member can't compare with the "probability of probability". If we have problems, we will not Come with a donkey, so as not to have an accident, the only sex was snatched back... Klein looked at the bellist Kano and brought a horse lantern from the corner of the room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At this time, he quietly opened the vision, and simply looked at the other side.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This look, Klein almost raised his eyebrows because of Kano’s gas field color Quite freakish.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mood color is no problem, very normal, can represent the body of the etheric body but not natural enough, the heart of the green, the head of the purple, digestion The yellow color of the system has a patchy taste and is not very harmonious.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the spirit of Kano also gives a similar feeling.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kano made a good lantern and looked back at the adventurer of the German. Sparo. He said nothing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very sensitive to the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you have found some problems. I am not a natural born person. I am a product of the Mother Earth Church, which is relatively unsuccessful. That kind, so, I don't have the ability at all. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His last sentence was to Dakwell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kano no longer Opening, carrying a lantern, wearing a black robe, licking the tall body, with the dim light, stepping down in the dark silent bell tower.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The product of the body of the Mother Earth Church? The Church of San Drocco belongs to the Storm Church... Because of the relative failure and disregard, the Karno traitor has become the member of the School of Life and is a member of the Life School. This is understandable. The Mother Earth Church and the School of Life all hold the "pharmacist" approach, and there must be a certain intersection... Why does the life school send this seemingly incomprehensible guy to the Storm Church to be a bellist? Normal identity disguise, Or is there a connection between the two? Klein calmly follows Caron, stepping out of the clock tower and winding around a stone bridge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the left side of the bridge hole, Klein felt a little, looked up and looked up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owl Harry followed and flew over and fell onto a branch.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The branch suddenly broke, Harry fell straight, and finally flew back and did not fall to the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell is about to speak, Kano has explained in a low way: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Rickard was injured and his strength was somewhat uncontrollable. As long as he entered a certain range, he would be tainted with bad luck. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kano stopped and threw the ring box of the scorpion to the bridge hole:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Member, Roy Kim’s student sent the nephew. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. "A hoarse voice came from the depths of the dark bridge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A palm with a few silver scales groped out from the darkness, held down The ring box that fell on the dirt.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he opened the ring box and took out the milky white dice inside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also has another hand with silver scales to poke out, holding a piece of paper-like leather in his palm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The item is like a water pipe However, it meets end to end, showing a gray color in the moonlight of the blush, complex symbols and logos on the surface, and many ancient Hermesian texts pointing to the "Silver Snake" Will Anthony.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Destiny Member" Ricciard unplugged the item, stuffed the "probability of the cockroaches" into it, and then reconnected the head and tail.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seal the "probability of the probabilities" with a small repeating fate, so that it is always in a state of sleep or quiet? Sure enough, "Silver of the Mercury" Will. I foresee a similar thing and made some preparations... Klein relieved his eyes and heard that Rhodes was dumb and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I already know yours The agreement, Mr. Gelman Sparo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magical item will help you find it when I recover.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 700 pounds... I immediately gave you the extra luck. When you go to a few casinos in Olavi, you can get the reward. Remember, each casino should not win more than 200 pounds, and the total is no more than 700 pounds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, you have no money...Seeing how you are injured and hiding, it’s normal to have no money... Klein nodded and nodded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
