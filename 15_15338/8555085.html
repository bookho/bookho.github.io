			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This I know... "Justice" Audrey’s eyes turned halfway, her chin was slightly raised, and she happily turned her eyes to the front and cast it to the support dome. A stone pillar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly regained her gaze and was ready to appreciate the reaction of Mr. "downside down" after hearing the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Fols vaguely understands one thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russell's diary, you can exchange some questions from Mr. "fool", maybe you can exchange items! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Russell Diary? Are Russell writing with unique symbols, those that others can't understand? They turned out to be diaries? The tone is very certain, and Mr. 'Footer' has no rebuttal...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have met a lot, but because I am not interested, I have never bought it, oh, There are a lot of Miss Audrey! She is a fanatic in this regard! However, her dog was last week, no, maybe last week, I don’t remember very well. In short, it has shredded many books and notes, including all the Russell Diaries Diary. ! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden surprise and the accompanying disappointment filled the heart of Fols, and she wanted to raise her hands, cover her ears, and scream叫.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so insufficient to express her mood at this time!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hate dogs!" The magician "Fuls hates to hate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request for "downside down" is quite unexpected for Klein, but for him, It is the easiest to complete, so I laughed aloud:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want everyone to hear it, or do you know it yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "The hangman" Alger replied without hesitation: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only know for myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He does not have the spirit of selfless dedication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and shielded the senses of the rest of the members, which made Miss "Justice" very wronged, and she was waiting to see Mr. "downside down" and wrong again. The shocked expression is like doing a great thing for yourself. Although it does not actively promote it, it is very much looking forward to the reaction of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the hateful "downside down" deprives me of this happiness! Audrey sighed in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, she is very clear that the other party’s request is absolutely justified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I already knew the answer... she grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein leisurely flipped the card of the shackle and set it up so that the "upside down man" could directly see the black armor worn. Crown, Russell with a cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portrait of the great emperor can often be seen, "hanging people" Alger is no stranger, immediately recognized, and more importantly, the card There is also a bright logo on the top:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 0, Black Emperor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough! It is the so-called tarot card prototype that is rumored to be the card that hides the gods made by Roussal the Great! Sequence 0, "Black Emperor"... This corresponds to the path of the "lawyer" approach to the gods? Mr. Fool’s has been collecting Russell’s diary. It seems to be a clue to find the deck of cards from inside. Only a few months later, he has already got one... Alger is surprised and happy, and Excited and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, he inexplicably feels that the prospect of the "Tarot Club" is extremely bright. Before <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was only obsessed with the mystery and power of Mr. "The Fool", and only for the purpose of exchanging information and articles for the so-called "Talo Club", but Now, he began to think about the benefits that he and other members could get after Russell's cards were collected by Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein said slowly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"亵渎牌."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately Unblocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the senses were restored, "Justice" Audrey immediately turned his gaze to the "upside down man" and vaguely "read" through the blurred image. The shock, joy and yearning of the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case... Audrey has received great satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The card of 亵渎"... It is really related to "Slate"... "After hanging down" Alger looked down for a few seconds and started to get new Three pages of Russell Diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the three yellow-brown parchments came to Kline’s hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks like he casually hangs his eyes and reads it slowly and slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"March On the fifteenth day, I was the protagonist. With some archaeological clues and folk rumors, I found a ghost ship left by the Solomon Empire near the Oradec Islands on the edge of the misty sea. The ancient 'Black Throne'! Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It really pulls the wind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some ancient books on the top, including a treasure map pointing to an unnamed island, a Solomon empire that has resigned and left the North. The last settlement of the great nobility, everything he left behind is there!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This treasure will belong to me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On March 19th, after repeated consideration and measurement, I finally decided to sail to the sea once. After that, I will enter the Kingdom Army as an officer. It is difficult to have such an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Edwards and Green are willing to follow me in the foggy ocean.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "In fact, I am not simply for the treasure, I still want to verify a problem, from the sun, to the red moon, from the trajectory of the stars moving in the sky, to the alternating spring, summer, autumn and winter, all kinds of signs and different data prove that I The world in which it is located should be a planet. In this case, it should not be only the north and south continents. It is inferred from various data that the area occupied by the north and the south does not add up to 10% of the planet. Other places are only the ocean, only Islands? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The west of the northern continent is the foggy sea, and the east is the sea of ​​the sea. I suspect that the end of these two oceans, there are other continents, like violent The end of the sea is the same as that of the South Continent. Maybe I can find a brand new continent, the Western Continent!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get off, the great navigator Russell Columbus. Magellan Gustav, to verify your guess! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great emperor was really embarrassed when he was young. Just because he didn't know whether it was true or not, he didn't know what hidden treasure map, and dared to go sailing. No, after he was old, the same embarrassment, "the card of the shackles" is the evidence... Klein couldn't help but swear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This page diary It seems to be related to the page he has seen before, with one or two other diaries in the middle. So, Klein is roughly certain that Russell found a safe place in this voyage because he lost his way. The original island outside the fairway has many extraordinary creatures. In the process, he also used the stalks of "Apocalypse Four Knights" and "One Piece" to tease the Green and Edwards who followed him to the sea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Green, the person who was praised by Russell as the smartest of us, became more and more strange after discovering the original island, and eventually died in the foggy sea. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s said that the world’s view of the planet is now Widely recognized and confirmed by astronomy... Klein turned to the second page of the diary:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"April 18, I was in the 'Black Throne' In those ancient books, the term 'Western continent' was discovered! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really there is the Western Continent!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, even in the Quaternary, in Solomon The empire, when the gods were still walking on the earth, the Western Continent was only a rumor. It was said to be the hometown of the elves, involving the ancient god called Sunia Solem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
