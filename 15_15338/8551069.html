In the afternoon, depending on the situation, decide whether to go to the divination club. On Monday morning, he just ran to Hoyage University. To summon members of the Tarot Club, he has to consider playing the role of the divination. In short, he is busy all week, and there is no chance to rest and relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, at this moment, Klein only wants to be decadent, like a salted fish at home, doing nothing and not wanting, purely dazed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, as a 'cult" organization, how can BOSS be so ruined, if it is known by Miss Justice and Mr. Hangman, their three views will be broken... ..." Klein buried his face in the quilt and aired himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have the recipe for the clown potion, just wait for the divination potion to digest it completely... I have the recipe for the clown potion, just wait for divination The potion was thoroughly digested..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He muttered a few words, suddenly turned over and sat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the trouser pocket, a brass coin, Klein quickly divined whether it is suitable for the club today, got a positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five, four, three, two, one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished the countdown, he forced himself Stand straight, walk towards the coat rack, remove the tuxedo jacket and the half-height silk hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horse District, in the Divination Club meeting room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is sitting in a cool corner, drinking Xibe black tea, and looking at the "Tingen City Laoshiren", there are very few members around, only Then six or seven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady’s eyebrows were curved, her eyes were large but not enough, and her left hand was holding a feather-filled black velvet Intis hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hat is really exaggerated, not wearing a neck? Klein noticed, looked at the past, and squeezed his eyebrows as if to ease the fatigue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his spirit, Glacis and the woman with green eyes were healthy but anxious, angry and confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Glacis, the Mr. Lalhous is really not trustworthy, right?" Klein didn't get up, smiled slightly. Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time, Gracies, who had just recovered from lung disease, asked him to divinate him about investing in Llanus Steel, and got bad results. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Klein looked at the other side’s hesitant look, thinking that he would still choose to take risks, at most, no longer put on all the net worth, so now see him Immediately after the emotional color, there was Lenovo and made a judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grassis is a glimpse, and immediately laughs: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am really I regret not accepting your divination advice. Oh, this is the second time I said this, hope, no, I firmly believe that there will be no third."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He turned his head and said to the lady with a little crow's feet in the corner of the eye:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Christina, you see, we haven't spoken yet, Moretti Mr. knows our purpose. He is the most amazing diviner I have ever seen. I prefer to use the divination to describe him.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Good afternoon, Mr. Moretti, we are here because of the affairs of Llanus.” The lady named Christina simply took a ritual and looked a little confused and anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go to the citrine room?" Glacis was relatively calm and pointed to the door of the conference room with his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and got up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the work of a diviner." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked along the aisle, walked to the door and entered the unmanned citrine room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grassis locked the wooden door and sighed as he walked to the seat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lan Erwus disappeared. He used his excuse to go to West Vilas County to supervise the mining of minerals, left Tingen, and never returned. We sent people to look for steam trains and found that his so-called high-grade large iron ore only existed. On the drawings. Let me feel fortunate that I thought of your divination proposal and eventually invested only one-third of the original amount, otherwise I will lose my family and lose my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s eyes looked at the two people more deeply than usual, and asked with a little curiousness:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This major investment decision, you should not choose a representative, go to the Hornachs Mountains in West Vilas to verify it in the field?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christina The speed of speech is quite quick: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our representative was confused, temporarily hired by Lanerus, temporary rent The place, the temporarily enclosed land is confusing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not ask more, maintaining the divination posture:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to divination?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to divinate whether this thing can be recovered." Christina saw Gera Sith looked at him and said openly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took paper and pen:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we do astral divination, I Q, you answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question and answer, Klein marked the thunder constellation in the corresponding position, marked with the symbol of various situations, completed The event astrolabe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Sir, you are at a fork in the road. If you are greedy, panic, and ignorant, you will fall further into the abyss and you will never be able to get rid of it. But if you can stand, wait, persist, no longer greedy, you will be greeted. Turning, you will see the sun..." Kline said quickly and slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Christina slowly beheaded and thought about it. "Mr. Moretti, can you divince the whereabouts of Llanus? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I’m afraid it’s not possible. The big information left by Lalhous is false, even the name may not be true, which makes me How to divination? Unless you can get his very detailed real information, or provide personal items." Klein answered truthfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clestina was silent for a while, and took out 1 Sule's banknotes and gave it to Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I heard that Gracius mentioned that you are a true diviner who fears fate and does not greet money. The rest is even a tip for the club."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for giving me confidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up, politely left, and quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not greedy for money... No, I am vulgar! Klein regretted what he had before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;View Christina ¦, Glacis closes the door and turns back and asks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is there really no way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What I just said is the way." Klein smiled back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哎..." Glacis sighed. "Lalus has swept away more than 10,000 pounds of money, and the victims have more than 100 people. Lucky. The only thing I lost was £50, I just lost my savings, I didn’t have debt, and Ms. Christina invested £150, which is not an easy amount for her.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you alarming?" Klein heard the number of 10,000 pounds and suddenly expressed indignation at the fraudster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amount, even in Beckland, can be a rich man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a simple search for people, don’t know if the police will find a night servant, a punitive person or a mechanical heart to help... Kline’s thoughts are divergent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grassis focuses on the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have already alerted the police, and the police also attach great importance to it. Negotiation, we are willing to take a part of the money from the recovery as a reward, no matter who, as long as it can provide the relevant clues of the fall of Lalhous, once verified, you can get a reward of 10 pounds, if you can give the exact hiding Information to help the police catch Lalhus, you can get 100 pounds of cash!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clue is 10 pounds? Caught Llanus 100 pounds? Klein could barely hear his eyes bright and his breathing heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he is worried about the source of follow-up detective expenses:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week's extra salary 3 Pound plus the rest of the private money, just can pay the second pen, but if the Henry detective can complete two commissions next week, his extra weekly salary is not enough for the final part, so a few Soules, of course It is no place to use private money during this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May be able to get the personal belongings of Lalus from the police, but if he really left Tingen, it didn’t work... Klein’s moments Looking forward to sighing again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next one and a half hours, because of the recommendation of Angelica, two people are looking for Klein "consultation", one is just over 1 The old child divined, and Klein directly painted the birth chart, saying that the other party was convinced and satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is looking for items. Klein used Tarot divination combined with dream divination to lock him into a rough range, which made him very surprised because never I have seen diviners who give such accurate information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
