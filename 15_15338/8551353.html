			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang looking at the saviin standing in front of the monster's body, and looking sideways at the "detainee" who was responsible for the containment, helped the half-conscious companion, Klein suddenly had an indescribable sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the night, the punisher, or the member of the mechanical heart, almost no one can become a hero, because everything that is done is not known to the public. It can only be hidden in a variety of confidential documents, but the dangers and pains are so real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe one day, my opponent will be my teammate... Klein silently sighs and feels the "nighter", "the penalty" and " The heavy weight of the term "Mechanical Heart Member". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Old Neil sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's leave, don't bother They."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein picked up his cane, just about to step, and suddenly saw that Neil was still holding his left hand, so he asked, "Are you injured?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bounced The flying debris is tied up. When I am young, I can definitely hide. Fortunately, this is only a small problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loosened his right hand slightly Let Klein see the small wound on the left palm of his hand that is still bleeding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there was no major problem, Klein sighed down the ramp and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Neil, you are more calm than I thought. In the case where the monster is less than two meters away from you, you can calmly read the words and use the spell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the custodian who lost control became a monster at the time was rushing to Klein, but Neil was always close to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of praise, Old Neil immediately laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a senior value night In the dangerous scenes I have experienced, the things I just did not even enter the top ten. I remember once, I and Dunn visited the Rafael cemetery. Some of the dead did not know when they became a living corpse. The tomb, quietly ambushing in the shadow of the trees, I passed by, did not notice it, thinking about finding a hidden place, hey, you know, the result was he slammed into the back, holding his neck." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein heard a bit of a thrilling, speculative question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this case Next, can you calmly use spells, or a spell that can be quickly applied by a 'sneak peek'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil glanced at him, low Laughing: "No, Dunn dragged the living body into the sleep in time. I said this thing is to tell you that as a night actor, you must not only believe in yourself, but also Teammates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Kline was silent for a few seconds, half of it was a joke and said from the bottom of his heart, "Mr. Neil, you are so today. Wisdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil jumped one step and set foot on the dock, swearing with disdain:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is because you usually only recognize my most insignificant side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked out of the dock and returned to the front of the Dragon Bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein put away the revolver, leaned on the cane, took off his coat, and checked the light of the gas streetlight to check for damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so lucky, just a few wooden thorns, dirty a small place...” He pulled out the debris, roughly cleaned the dust, re-dressed neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil smiled and looked at him, imitating his tone, and added: "It’s a pity, I can’t reimburse it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Klein couldn’t find a language response for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not such a person! He emphasized one sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the public carriage arrived, and Klein took out a silver pocket watch with a stalked road and glanced at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is nothing, I have to go home," he said to the old Neil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil nodded slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back and enjoy your dinner, don't worry about just The 'Sleeping Charm', I will find Swine to compensate, he is a rich man, of course, not today, I have to consider his mood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "...thank you for your generosity..." Klein opened his mouth and finally spit out such a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly walked into the carriage and returned to Narcissus Street all the way. At this time, it was more than seven o'clock, and the sky was completely dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get out the key and open the door. Klein saw that Melissa was taking off the gauze and hanging it on the coat rack, so she smiled and said nonsense: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are only coming back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the complex emotions he accumulated before disappeared The whole person has become relaxed and feels warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a practical course at school today." Melissa explained seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took his nose, smelled the smell of the food, licked it, and subconsciously asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Who is preparing dinner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, he and Melissa replied at the same time:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Banson!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of the two was a little scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Benson, who heard them talking, walked out of the kitchen and rubbed the apron on the apron:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Don't you have confidence in my cooking? I remember that when Melissa was still not cooking, you would be sensible waiting for me to go home, very eager to watch me cooking, in fact, cooking It's very simple, like potato stewed beef, first boiled beef, then put the potatoes, then put the seasoning..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and Melissa look at each other Glanced at it and kept silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a cane and a hat, Klein turned and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think It’s time to ask a miscellaneous maid, and it’s always unhealthy to have dinner on time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I don’t want to have strangers beside us when we chat, that would I feel uncomfortable." Melissa subconsciously found a reason to veto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took off his coat and smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't care..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, his expression suddenly stagnate, the action paused:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I almost took off my coat, but I have a revolver. But I have a revolver...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough." He cleared his throat and did nothing. Said, "Don't care, after we go home, we can let the miscellaneous maid take a break in her room. I don't think any servant doesn't like to rest. Well, you must find a miscellaneous maid who is willing to learn to cook."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not want to suffer from the ravages of dark cooking in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson stood at the door of the kitchen and agreed to nod:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When there is free time, We can go to the 'Tingen City Helping Family Servant Association', they have a wealth of resources and sufficient understanding in this regard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, it's so happy The land decided!" Klein ignored Melissa's reluctant eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Queens, Gregory's Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey Hall took the close-up maid Anne and left the ball, went up to the second floor and entered the bedroom arranged by the Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of Anne, she slowly took off her gorgeous skirt and light dance shoes and put on a black hooded robes prepared in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wearing a hood, Audrey stood in front of the full-length mirror and began to examine himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw that most of her face was covered by hood shadows, only the beautifully curved lips could be clearly noticed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black robes, hidden in the shadows, mysterious and deep feelings... This is what I have always dreamed of! Audrey thought with joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not too confident to add a blue bonnet to her hood, with a black fine gauze hanging down, making her facial features 朦胧. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, that's it!" Audrey stuffed her feet into calfskin booties, sideways to Annie. "You are here waiting for me, no matter what Whoever comes, don't open the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne looked helplessly at the lady: "But you must make sure that you don't go out for more than an hour this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should believe me, I have kept my promises a few times before." Audrey smiled and leaned close to the maid, hugged each other and made a veil . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, she jumped a few steps briskly, pulled her hood, and turned away from the dark door to leave her bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went all the way down to the side door of the Viscount’s house and saw that a carriage had stopped there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Grallett stood in the shadows, looked at Audrey and praised it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You dress like this really, um, like Russell's usual description, it's cool."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Graceful and robes, a graceful and enjoyable ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two got on the carriage, went out of the villa, and came to a house ten minutes away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the main entrance of the house, Audrey saw the "apprentice" of the day and the "arbitrator" of her friend Dilcah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fols brown hair micro-volume, light blue eyes with a natural lazy, she pointed to the side of Hugh Dear Cha: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is an excellent persuader who can help you get what you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hugh Dilcha's height is short, at most one meter and five, and the facial features are delicate and soft, but the eyebrows seem to have never been open, quite green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she has a messy, rough shoulder and yellow hair, wearing a traditional knight's exercise suit, she has an indescribable majesty and convincing charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey and the other party have seen several times, and Xiao Xiao called and called:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Miss Hugh, can I trust you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to worry at all." Hugh Dilcha smiled and made a gesture of please. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she stepped up to catch up with Audrey and Gretel, she suddenly had a "dang" sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey looked at the sound and saw Hugh Dilcha’s feet lying quietly with a twinkling thorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Audrey and the other side, look at me, I see you, and forget to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a dozen seconds, Hugh Dilcha swiftly and agilely smashed, picking up the three-sided thorn and hiding it on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We must guard against accidents, some people lack sufficient reason, not so easily convinced." Hugh Dilcha explained in a serious way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey nodded silently, answering in detail:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe in you... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a prop that lets some guys calm down and talk to us." Fols turned his face and looked at the lawn, making a side note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
