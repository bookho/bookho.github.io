			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late at night, 7 Pfst Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Mitchell sat down on the chair, lifted his feet, reached the desk and rested on the edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he leaned back and pressed the joint of the wood to creak and the breathing gradually became longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, his eyelids pulled down and covered the scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Leonard’s spirit has come to a gray world, but the place is still his own bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flew to the window and saw the thick fog covering the nearby neighborhood and extending all the way out, seeming to cover the entire Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas street lamp next to the street, the warm fire in the different houses, is very faint at this time, can only illuminate the small area around, and dyed it A little bit embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, a group of illusory elliptical balls of light or hidden or present, staggered across a house, seems to be the source of their existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the city in the eyes of "nightmare." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard jumped out of the window in the form of a "nightmare" in accordance with the situation previously investigated and flew to No. 17 Minsk Street in Jowood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't break in directly, fell into the doorway in the thick fog, and politely rang the doorbell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the voice of "Cuckoo" and "Cugu", Starling Summerer in a nightdress opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stopped the silver-filled court feather fan on her chest and asked confusedly and puzzledly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Which one are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the landlord of Klein who plays Sherlock Moriatti, is about 30 years old Blonde blue-eyed lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard has now replaced the black and white Lun police uniform, and presented the documents at will:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know Sherlock. Moriarty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in the dream, Starling reacted slowly, after several times Seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked, at the same time, Under the influence of Leonard, Sherlock Moriatti, who naturally appeared in the mind, was wearing a half-height silk hat. Wearing a double-breasted long dress, gold-rimmed glasses on the bridge of the nose, a beard with a long ring around the mouth...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was with Sherlock before Leonard. Moriarty was in agreement, so there was no doubt, saying: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was involved in a case and is under investigation.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope you can work with us. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, ok. "Stalene wanted to lift her chin, but I don't know why I was a little scared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard thought for a second:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When did he rent a house? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last September. "Starlin recalled the next way.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard continued to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You What do you know about him? Or, in your heart, what kind of person is he? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After mentioning this, Starlin seems to have considered the answer long ago:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He comes from Kamihain. He has an accent on the other side. He is a very capable detective. He once helped Mary to solve her husband's affair. However, his income is not high, and he can't even afford a full-time miscellaneous maid. I can help my maid to help part-time... My child told me that he is a very telling story, especially good at detective stories, which may be the reason why he chose that industry..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without interrupting Leonard, she continued to say: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is not as rude as a general detective, read a grammar school, learned The most enviable thing about history is that thanks to Mary, I joined the Cragg Club, where I am a very identifiable person. I have been there a few times...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;" Later he seemed to be famous in the detective circle, often with private detectives coming to him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard was a little impatient, I couldn't help but raise my hand and smashed my forehead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Mrs. Starling, he didn't get any useful information except Sherlock Moratti. The economic situation is not very good and it is good at telling the story of the detective. The rest are within the intelligence range that he investigated before. He even knows that Sherlock Moriarty has a good relationship with Essinger Stanton.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, from the Craig Club and Sherlock Moriatti, the relationship between the better ones... After listening to Mrs. Starling's embarrassment, Leonard immediately thanked the other party and left her dream.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160 Burkrend Street, in the house of Dawn. Dontes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Available for hundreds In the hall where the guests dance, Klein is dancing in a woman in her thirties.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the etiquette teacher that Walter has called, called tile Hannah Hessen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a long-standing female name, but I am not ordinary, the five senses are only moderately high, but very temperament, every move Very interesting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Walter, she was born into a baron family, was well educated at an early age, and later entered the court as a female official until she got married.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the family has fallen, her husband’s financial situation is also general, she believes in the night goddess she chooses to be a ceremonial family teacher, often coming in different nobles or rich Ting, teach their children.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the butler did not say it, Klein knew that he could not perform too badly in front of this lady, otherwise the wind review would be basically saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——One of the important ways for aristocrats, rich people, and other upper class to inquire about a person’s situation is through a common acquaintance. And sometimes, the servant's interaction also has this meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked in the footsteps, the body swayed, and the black-haired light-handed Vahana applauded the position:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mr. Tang Taisi, it's really hard to imagine that you haven't learned this dance before.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In less than two quarters, you are proficient Like a nobleman who has received similar education since childhood. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is your teaching. "Klein smiled modestly, his expression was mild, and he was not showing his arrogance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With "Clown" balance coordination, dancing is a very simple thing for him. Vahana bowed his head and chuckled a bit: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are one A gentleman who is very happy for women. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her light brown scorpion then lifted up and swept through the horns and the lingering blue enamel of Dawn Dontes's doped silver.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the best compliment I have heard today. Klein smiled and responded at the same time, the footsteps did not stop, with Vahana lightly circled, not far away, the band invited to let the beautiful melodies continue to echo in the hall.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is interested in being familiar with Vahana, not only to improve the style, but also because the other party has served as a court lady.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waha Na corrected Daun Dontes's minor mistake: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inviting ladies to dance, not just dancing, but also having the necessary conversations, Can't be like two dolls, unless you are all immersed in music and immersed in the rhythm of dance, don't want to talk, of course, this is also a communication, spiritual communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When talking, be sure to be subtle. Here is Lun, not Intis.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In simple terms, don't be rude, let yourself appear demeanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I give an example. If you want to praise the lady's perfume, you can't directly say how good the taste is, you can't ask which kind of perfume and give praise, you To associate with the more subtle meaning, put a sentence on the side, um, you can say this: I seem to have come to the suburbs of spring.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, this must be met The characteristics of perfume. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sense of literature, isn't it supposed to say "Is the moonlight tonight beautiful?" Klein sighed with a Japanese-style stalk, and laughed at himself: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for not saying that my praises are not enough. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wahana’s smile is getting deeper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Tang Taisi, you know What is a gentleman who is popular with women in social situations? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. Klein shook his head calmly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wahana smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second Popular is the man who makes the lady think he is smart. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First? Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wahana glanced at him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" A popular one is a man who makes women feel smart. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, she smiled and didn't speak again. Klein understood her hidden praise.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Luen’s subtleness...not like Intis’s, all running down the lower body... well, this is a report in a newspaper and magazine, the real Intis The social field is what it is, and it cannot be determined accordingly. In any case, the two countries are always smashing each other... The era of the Emperor is in line with that description... Klein nodded in no doubt.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-hour etiquette course came to an end in such a harmonious atmosphere. Klein took the steward Walter and the personal maid Richardson to send the teacher Vahana Hessen to the door. , gave her a small gift.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the “Moonlight” perfume from Drim, which is filled with gray amber and is quite expensive.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the specifics, Klein is not clear, because the butler Walter is responsible for buying, spending from the female tube Going home, waiting until the 1000 pounds is almost spent, and when new funds are needed, Tanaia will take the bills and forms for him to review.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g The reason why Ryan knows which company and what perfume is because Mr. Guan Jia told him in advance that he would not know anything when he asked Ms. Wahhana. It is not enough sincerity.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these details, he deeply understands the role of a good steward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching satisfaction with Ms. Vahana Hessen Klein resisted the impulse of the forehead, and sincerely exclaimed in his heart: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is more tired than fighting the extraordinary, you must always pay attention to the action, consider Argument... I have to take a break. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Walter in white gloves stepped forward:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sir, since your progress in etiquette is fast, you can advance the rest of the course." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What course? "Klein had a headache.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"History, international politics, philosophy, music, and common sense of golf, horse racing, hunting, etc..." Walter answered meticulously.道.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Philosophy? Klein asked with a slight sigh.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val features the next line:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
