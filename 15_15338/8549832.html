			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil glaring at the temple:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reason why you committed suicide is probably clear That note is also in the hands of Riel Bieber, and things have been exposed. Whether you are alive or dead, it is difficult to influence subsequent development. I think, I think, the strange existence of all this. Or the mysterious power, will not pay special attention to you, just like you will not care about the ants on the ground, huh, huh, as long as you do not try to let 'He' think of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "And we will pass to Riel Bieber soon to the secret society, they should be able to guess, this is related to the whereabouts of the Antignus family notes, believe me, these survived The secret organization of the millennium must have a variety of news channels, so their focus will turn to Riel Bieber’s whereabouts, trying to grab notes before us, no, no, no more to harass you, follow you , to deal with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people, I like you, get rid of the shadow of the past, and will usher in a new journey full of sunshine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened to nod, and was delighted and relaxed. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hope is like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the crossing to the side, it is shrouded in its own head The haze seems to be dissipating...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, frankly, Klein is still awkward because there seems to be some degree between himself and the note. The embarrassment, so that when doing the normal task of saving the hostage, it is very coincidental to find traces of residue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was really afraid that one day, the postman suddenly sent a parcel and opened it himself, but found that it was the note of the Antignus family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that everything can develop as described by the old Neil... He silently prayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neal heard his answer and suddenly laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't seem to be Goddess devout believers, this time, should not draw a red moon on the chest, say "may Goddess bless us"?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Neil, you It doesn't seem to be, the true believers will not say 'welcome a new journey full of sunshine'." After this period of "mystery course", Klein and the old Neil established a good friendship, so unceremoniously Satire back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other with a tacit sigh of relief, almost simultaneously on the chest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;“赞美女神!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sound of the picks, marbles, etc. turned, and the black thorn security company’s door was opened. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The graceful Mrs. Oliana puts the fashionable curls up and the light green skirt swayed into the reception hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Mr. Neil, good morning, Klein." She grabbed the bag made of calfskin and smiled and said hello. "Today is a sunny day, a good day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Oliana, you are as beautiful as the previous ten years." He smiled and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olianna’s eyes are wide and the face is on the face:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your compliments are still as irritating as the past ten years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has accented the words over a decade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Old Neil looked at Klein inexplicably, his face full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t mention things that will remind women of their age... As a keyboard player who knows everything, Klein instantly understands Mrs. Liana’s point of care, smirked and said: “Good morning, Mrs. Oliana, you are so beautiful every day.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, our excellent Hoy graduates." Oliana smiled and said, "The old butler has paid for the commission, according to the captain. The stipulations are half of the extra funds, half for you and Leonard, and you are not a regular member, you can only get 10% of that half, and you can sign it and wait for it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much did he pay?" Klein asked happily and distressedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"200 pounds, he said so at the time, Lord, the storm is on, I really can't imagine, can't believe, this thing is solved! This is no more difficult than making a dream for you! Why is your security company not famous? This is a shame for the whole industry!” Mrs. Oliana imitated the accent of the old butler with a southern accent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought for a few seconds, humor said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This pair of kidnappers actually It’s not fair.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two extraordinary people quickly solved the problem in a way that can be described as easy and comfortable... It’s like a heavily armed adult bullying A small child...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are too unlucky, they must have lost the blessing of the gods." Oliana laughed softly. "I told the old man." Butler, this commission is just enough for us to be lucky. It is just that the cable people see the group of kidnappers carrying the children into the hiding place. Therefore, don't expect too much from us. We are really just a very ordinary security company. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, the more emphasis on ordinary, the less common... Klein smiled and said that Mrs. Oliana had entered the accounting room through the partition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil licked his lips next to him and said with envy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You It’s a lucky guy, how long it takes to join us and get a commission worth £200.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Is this rare?” Klein wondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not learning history, learning mystery, just hanging out and looking for clues with inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to Oliana's statistics, we may not be able to meet a commission in a week, and most of the commissions are worth less than £20." The white crystal pendant on the wrist replied with a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he implicitly looks forward to Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you meet again later For similar entrustment, please remember to inform me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the words of Old Neil, Klein suddenly had a strange feeling, so he asked directly Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Neil, you seem to be short of money? How much salary can you get per week? If it is not convenient, please ignore my question. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil leaned back on the back of the sofa, and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is not something that needs to be concealed. I have been here for many years. I can get a salary from the church and the police department every week for a total value of £12.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"12 pounds per week?" Klein stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 weeks of salary, 52 weeks a year, that is almost 600 pounds up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read the "Tingen Morning News" and "The Honest Man", I have introduced the senior barrister's appearance of 800 to 1000 pounds per year, which is advanced. Barrister! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Banson’s manager of their import and export company, the weekly salary is only 6 pounds, which is considered a decent figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this salary is actually rich enough, and we don't have to pay income tax." Old Neil smiled and added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened to his brother Benson, the weekly salary reached more than 1 pound, you need to pay the E tax, which is the government and company employees salary income tax, 1 pound to 3 pounds part three percent, 2 to 5 pounds part five percent, 5 pounds to 10 pounds 10 percent, 10 to 20 pounds 15 percent, 20 pounds or more 20 percent. In addition, he also saw four other income taxes in the newspapers. Class A is land, housing and other physical value-added profits tax, including government rent and Rent, Class B is agricultural income tax, Class C is bond, fund and stock profit tax, Class D is income tax for business, financial and professional industries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A point of appreciation." Klein echoed the words of Old Neil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But." Old Neil shook his head. "For us who need to explore secrets often, practice regularly, and try the rituals, the salary is always not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the materials not all be applied for?" Klein asked strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a limit, sometimes, You must also give enough justifications. If you want to practice more in the mysterious field, try more, you can only pay for the materials yourself, which can be bought inside, or you can go to some underground trading markets."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of Klein was a sensation, immediately asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The underground trading market with extraordinary materials? I thought, I I believe that the church certainly does not allow them to exist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are lacking enough material to get access! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a hidden organization behind it, can't everything be solved inside the night? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of thing can't be controlled at all. Well, in the occultist view, everything is alive, everything is the same, and the materials we use are not only from extraordinary. Species, also from normal animals, plants and minerals, such as the poisonous cockroaches, golden mint and night vanilla in your 'Divination' potion, are often encountered in everyday life, and they may not have extraordinary qualities. But they all have their own characteristics. After blending and blending, they can achieve certain effects. Therefore, this is not a transaction that the church can prohibit if it wants to prohibit it." Old Neil explained in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to wait for Klein to speak, he continues: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, extraordinary species are not the only ones The core is useful, just like the octopus, except for the blood, its eyes, its skin, its tentacles, are good materials, unless the church uses all of its own to capture, in order to completely hoard, control the outflow, It will be a very large economic burden. The more low-level extraordinary materials, the more so, only try to make the more special ones not circulate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil suddenly laughed. "Another important reason is that we know that the underground trading market is better than we don't know. Under the premise that the secret organization is not completely eliminated, this is a good strategy, and it can also be Help us get the shortage of materials. Of course, after such a market exists, there will definitely be contraband, as long as it is not too exaggerated, too dangerous, we all pretend not to see, use them to enrich our treasures."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "There are several churches that are mutually restrained and unable to adopt too aggressive means?" Klein said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil "Hmm", did not make a specific expansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a 'diviner', I will definitely need repeated practice in the future, I need more materials, Mr. Neil, can you take me to those underground transactions? Can the market take a look?” Klein asked for a legitimate reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil reveals a distressed expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, those places are active, big Some are not extraordinary, there are nobles who like mystery, there are rich people who yearn for this... Hey, well, I have a bill of 30 pounds that is about to expire, I am temporarily inconvenient."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." Klein didn't think it was the reason why he owed money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, he discouraged: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Neil, need to borrow money I have a reward of 10 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, no, I have a solution." Old Neil took the sofa and slowly stood up. Dao, "Hey, old is really the enemy that the creature can't deal with. The night of last night made me very tired. Well, this morning, you review the previous lessons yourself, read more literature, and until tomorrow, I will teach you ritual magic. Basic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein followed and got off the hat and said goodbye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the afternoon, seeing Captain Dunn not returning, Klein pretended that he was still looking for the note, once again swaying on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 10 pounds, he can go directly to the Divination Club without waiting for the funds to be allocated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
