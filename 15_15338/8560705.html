			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a philosophy class, Klein has the feeling that he has not slept for three days and three nights, full of skepticism, metaphysics, a priori Names and concepts such as nominalism, realism, social Russellism, existentialism, and positivism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the history of the original, there’s a glimpse of some philosophical knowledge, and he even wonders if he can fully take a class, which is no better than him. The non-one-on-one education of the university at the time of the earth, I can't understand if I can sleep or sleep, or read a novel to play mobile phones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is Mr. Hamid and I don’t think so much, funny, hearty, outgoing, lectures are not boring, neither like a philosophy teacher nor a storm The Lord's ideas that the believers often hold..." Klein raised his hand and slammed the forehead, turned away from the door, walked up the stairs deep in the hall, and returned all the way to the third floor, his personal maid Richardson. Silently followed by the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, he found that the maid maids are busy with their own affairs, no one is lazy, only when the employer passes by, will he pause Come down, say hello, it seems very educated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tanya is still very capable in the arrangement and management of family affairs... Klein stepped on the third floor aisle and walked to the semi-open room. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet, Klein saw that the butler Walter was hanging two double-barreled shotguns on the wall, giving him a rough and bold feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the layout that every rich businessman will have at home. The "hunting certificate" is very good, and the power of the double-barreled shotgun is not small enough to make the male at home. The servants deal with sneak thieves and even kidnappers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hanging up, Walter stepped back two steps, examined the shotgun, and took out a gold-shelled pocket watch from the inside pocket of the garment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed the pocket watch and looked at the inside of the lid, and the serious old-fashioned face was obviously softer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein coughed a light to remind the housekeeper, then pushed open the half-covered door and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter puts the pocket watch together, puts it back, and walks sideways:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. A total of six 'hunting licenses' were bought, and six double-barreled shotguns and corresponding shots were bought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s squatting is hiding the "Death Clock" revolver. I didn't care too much about it. I just clicked on it and said I knew it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately showed a gentle smile and asked in a chat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw 'help before When the Family Servant Association's information, noticed that Walter seems to have a wife and a child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steward, or the chief steward, is the employer’s deputy, Many things can't be circumvented, so it's something that every employer can do to get in touch with the housekeeper. Klein doesn't want to be an exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, he still remembers "The Mirror" Arrods said that there will be an extra expansion on the steward Mr. Walter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter replied in a serious manner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am at the home of Conrad When I was a manor of the manor, I was in constant contact with a woman for some affairs, and I developed feelings. Then, under the watchful eyes of the goddess, I stepped into the palace of marriage. With a daughter, she is now enrolled in a grammar. The school hopes to pass the entrance examination of the Beckland University, but this is something that will be considered two years later..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When referring to his wife and daughter, this Mr. Steward’s tone, which is not ridiculous, has become unconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- At present, all churches emphasize the importance of family to counter the pressures of life and spiritual problems brought about by the trend of technological progress, the only difference In fact, different churches have different emphases. The night is the equality between men and women. The storm is that men are busy, women are taking care of the family, and the angels are the supporters of the former. Steam is multi-learning and labor-intensive, each is good at each other and complement each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened inexplicably and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Taneiya seems to be single?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Walter’s expression was serious. "Modern society, male servants and maids are still It is not equal. This does not mean salary. The housekeeper belongs to the same level as the butler and the housekeeper assistant. Both have an annual salary of 25 to 50 pounds, but a deeper concept and idea. The church is committed to change, but it is full of obstruction. In part, after all, the goddess is not the only faith of Lun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Men can marry, and if a maid has a family, it means unemployment or the lowest, temporary employment, do not need to live in the employer's washing maid, all this to the female butler stage can be reversed, But this is not a young and inexperienced woman who can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not continue this topic, gently beheaded, and walked to the easy chair position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he glanced at the newspapers piled up next to the coffee table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart, Klein stopped and leaned over to the body, saying to Mr. Steward:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I saw an advertisement in the newspaper about the transfer of shares in the Beckland Bike Company. You consulted a professional lawyer and accountant in the past to find out the specific situation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I am very interested in this industry, if the price is right, consider buying it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that moment, Klein thought of a problem, that is, a rich man who brought huge sums of money to Beckland to look for further opportunities, it is impossible to not pay attention Transfer of shares of Beckland Bike Company.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if "he" does not see the prospects of this industry, he will find someone to understand it normally, otherwise it will not meet the requirements. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, you can also raise the price by the way, let the 10% share sell more money... Well, you must remember, just lift it, you can’t Too greedy, if you carry it in your hand, you should cry, it will make all my liquidity fall into it, unable to maintain the daily expenses... Klein is doing a good fantasy, and warns in my heart. A few words of myself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sir. Walter didn't ask much, he should bear it directly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 4:35 pm, the personal maid Richardson knocked on the door and entered the room. The book of Dawn. Don Tess Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., Mr. Morrie Macht and his wife, Ms. Liana, and the Church of St. Saul Mr. Electra, the bishop of the bishop, came to visit. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morrie Macht? The lower house of parliament? Also, the bishop of St. Seychelles came here... Klein thought about it, I smiled and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there such a courtesy? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has only attended two etiquette classes for the time being, knowing that this class will not be so direct to each other, they are the first to send the housekeeper and servant to the door, to deliver the invitation. Letter or appointment time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richardson habitually bows:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because Mr. Housekeeper sent business cards and gifts, I told my neighbors that you were at home the following week.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this case, the neighbor who received the business card is inquiring about your situation. After observing the corresponding details, you can not only send your own servant to invite you to be a guest, but also arrive at 4 pm. Between 5 o'clock, take a walk and walk by the way, go to the door for a semi-formal visit, um, ladies will wear the appropriate walk, otherwise it is not enough, and you can ask them to enjoy afternoon tea. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walked to the door, letting Richardson take off his coat and put it on himself, and asked casually:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why then there is Bishop Electra? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what he cares most. The question just was just a stepping stone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chadson replied as early as possible:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
