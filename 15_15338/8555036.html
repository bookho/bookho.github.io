			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Old Kohler did not hear a clear question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at some of the potholes ahead and laughed at himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Nothing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that the Liv family can get rid of the current situation and get better and better. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just did have a feeling. As a successor to the new era of the big food empire, thinking of the revolution, thinking of mobilizing the masses, thinking of changing the land, is normal. The instinctive reaction can be carefully considered, and the specific problems are analyzed. He also feels that the poor cannot save themselves because the world has extraordinary power, and some are quite strange, not solved by guns, just like "heterogeneous." "The sequence of the route 5 "resent" is the same.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one aspect, on the other hand, it is limited by the law of conservation of extraordinary characteristics, limited by the acquisition of materials. Extraordinary power cannot be universalized, and the advantage of the number of people is difficult to translate into effective combat power. Even if it can be popularized, as long as the problem of out of control is not resolved, it will also bring disaster.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp If there is no high-sequence strong, these methods have some solutions to some extent. However, the real world is not only semi-god and half-human, but also various seals that do not know how to die, and, gods. Really true, high On the other hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the poor will fight with the strikes and other means, there will be no major problems, but once they take up arms and build an army, they will inevitably encounter It is difficult to counter the counterattack, large-scale natural disasters, large-scale psychological cues are not impossible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and can compete with the official extraordinary institutions are mostly secret organizations, often Bringing evil attributes and joining them, death may not be the most tragic ending, so the most promising way to succeed in this revolution is to win the support of one or several churches.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On strikes and marches alone, how many concessions can the vested interests make? Buying will be relatively easy... but the last time the "real creator" almost used the poor The tragic situation came to Bakerland, and the goddess church and the informed aristocrats seemed to have some touch. This can be seen from the investigation task accepted by Mike reporter and the feedback from Miss Justice.... Kline wants to think infinitely. East Things in the dock area and the factory area.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, he couldn’t help but sigh and sighed in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thinking about it, or relying on the threat of evil spirits, is most likely to strive for the improvement of the situation for the poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the evil spirits are the most eager to take their flesh and blood, devour their souls, and most likely bring disasters that no one can escape.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really a great irony. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens, the luxury villa in the Earl of Hall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there was something else after Dr. Islant, Audrey took up the second psychological class this week.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi is more excited than her, rushed into the study early, and even the ball game that she usually plays is lost.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In this class, Audrey deliberately showed his own curiosity, and from time to time asked Islaland about the psychological knowledge related to the mysterious field.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the course, Islant finally thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Audrey, we have organized a seminar in this area. Yes, many members have more professional research on the intersection of psychology and occultism. Are you interested in joining? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course! "Audrey nodded without hesitation and answered, perfectly suited to the person who planned the innocent and curious girl.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Island showed a smile:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Audrey gave a positive response with a little excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sending her long hair and waist, Islant left the study, she closed the door, facing the mirror next to the bookcase, and quiet for two seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she lifted the skirt and stepped into a court dance, then looked at herself in the mirror and smiled:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Audrey, you are awesome!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey knows that he has entered the psychological alchemy club The first step, although the seminar is mostly just a peripheral circle, there are still many tests in the follow-up, but it really made her push the door of the psychological alchemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this process, she did not rely on external strength, based on her own observations and performances, perfection through the Islante psychologist, so She is very proud and proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The seminar sounds very interesting." Su Shi came over and shook his tail. "Audrey, can I join?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Join? Looking at a golden retriever, the eyes of a thief-loving dog, Audrey suddenly fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a long "hmm" sound:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Su Shi, temporarily not, you, You are too conspicuous..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, she turned around and smiled lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"But I can take you with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Friday night, Klein took the "master key" and black cane and walked out of Minsk Street No. 15 - without the latter, he estimated that he would not come back today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to "find" Dr. Allen, enter the other's dreams, and figure out exactly how the nightmare associated with Will Anthony is coming. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for where Dr. Allen lived, he had already inquired yesterday: 3 Burningham Road, Hillston District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein arrived there, the time had passed by 11 o'clock, and the surrounding neighborhoods were dimly lit, faint and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After throwing a coin and doing a divination, Klein crossed the iron fence outside and went around to the side, using the "master key" to open on the wall. An invisible passage entered the corridor where the black light was bonfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the pace of agility, he went silently to the second floor and hid in an unoccupied room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and confirm that Dr. Allen and his wife are already asleep, and Klein penetrates the wall and enters their bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing he did was to come up with the "Sleep Charm" and to open the mantra, so that Dr. Allen’s wife fell into a real sleep. I won't wake up suddenly, disturbing his subsequent dreams of her husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Klein sat in the chair in front of the dresser, holding the "dream charm" and whispered a Guhmish word:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blush!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, he suddenly felt the charm of the palm became light, just like it became An illusory thing without weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the spiritual infusion, the transparent flame envelops the spell and burns the deep, quiet black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black, driven by Klein’s will, spread out and shrouded Dr. Allen, and also shrouded himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who quickly entered the state of meditation, saw the innocent darkness and saw the lonely elliptical ball of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His spirituality extends over and touches the illusory things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
