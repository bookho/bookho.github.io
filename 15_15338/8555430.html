At that time, the organizer, the big detective, Mr. Essinger Stanton, had been attacked this afternoon!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must pay attention to it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police officer retracted the hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moriarty, rest assured, we You will definitely not ignore the possibility of your proposal and will report it to you immediately. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you so much. Klein put on his hat and walked out of the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing the two threatening letters and the provocative demon dog owner’s provocation, he took the evidence without hesitation The nearest police station reported the case and secretly hoped that the matter would be handed over to the punitive or mechanical heart team as soon as possible, leaving themselves in the protection of the official powerhouse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Although he does not have the reason to retain the identity of the detective, he can completely abandon the residence at 15 Minsk Street and change his place to another identity, but he suspects that this may be the purpose of threatening the writer:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forcing yourself to stay up all night with the fear of wild extraordinary people, and then seize the opportunity to launch an attack in the process.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, my way to report is also very suitable for starting... The same was true when I was at home... The guy had another plot... Klein returned to Minsk Street with doubt and caution.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just left the carriage and borrowed The gas street lamp contaminated with some rain saw a personal shadow on the doorstep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein first glimpsed in the heart and immediately relaxed because he recognized the person Who is the visitor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a private detective Stuart, who is a medium-thin and thin, with his own admirer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also can't care... In the event that the "Devil" follow-up has the ability to resemble a "no face"? Klein clenches his cane, walks slowly, and then screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart Detective jerked back and said with a bit of nervousness:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mr. Moriarty, I received a threatening letter, the above is 'You are going to die!' ’”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you also received? "Klein was surprised and felt that he was out of the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is one of the detectives convened by Essinger Stanton in the serial murder case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart’s eyes are abruptly enlarged:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you also received? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "Klein's focus is on the head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more than one... he added a sentence silently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How to do this? I went to Mr. Stanton first. I heard that he was attacked. I quickly came to you. Hey, thank God for his blessing. I almost left early! Stuart said, "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pointed to the door:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We first Go in and say. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the living room, he excuses to go to the bathroom, and quickly went to the fog to do two divinations, one is to confirm whether Stuart is his own, The second is to 'inquire' whether there is a greater danger tonight, and the result has been fully affirmed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Stuart is not an enemy change. And there is no small danger tonight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limitation of this mysterious field cannot be solved by technical means such as exclusion and dichotomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the real world, Klein pressed the mechanical button of the toilet, and in the sound of the water, washed and pulled the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stuart, do you want coffee or black tea?" Klein asked without a fluster. Stuart stood up and shook his head: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem, although I have received a lot of threatening letters before, but not once compared with today, he must have written it with blood! My instinct tells me that he will definitely take action and have that ability!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Mr. Stanton was attacked and he did it?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so. Klein said calmly, and immediately sat down. "This should be related to the previous serial killings. You, I, Mr. Stanton's only common intersection is this case." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart's reaction was a bit too aggressive... was scared by Mr. Stanton's attack? At the same time, Klein carefully observed each other.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infected by his attitude, Stuart calmed down a lot, sat down again, thinking and saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice has not fallen, and the room suddenly echoes the sound of slamming.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone rang the doorbell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart suddenly shook a bit, as if the bird was scared.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at him with a slight brow and got up to the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just took the handle and the outside scene was already It appears in his mind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actor is a sneaker in the gray coat, and her assistant red-haired girl Lydia, and several others A man who looks familiar.<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private detectives who were summoned by Mr. Stanton... Sure enough... Klein recognized the visitors once they thought about it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled the door open and took two steps at the same time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casalina with thick eyebrows and a slight drooping cheek muscles Klein and Stuart behind him, without a chill, said straightforwardly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have all received the same threatening letter, should you also? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. Klein solemnly responded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caslana spit out his breath without hesitation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "We have all been called by Mr. Stanton to participate in the detection of the serial killings. This is the only thing in common. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too. Klein pointed to the inside of the house. "Come in and say." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the six private detectives coming in, Klein quickly analyzed the intention of the demon dog owner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Made so big, it will soon attract the attention of the official extraordinary organization, maybe there will be a half-god and a half-strong strongman in the vicinity, how can he retaliate?<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is purely a provocation, so that the military and the extraordinary people of the three churches have to send people to protect so many private detectives, both divergent and exhausted, and dare not neglect, in retaliation for the hands-on The main goal?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, there may be opportunities to kill several official extraordinary people...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And the actions of private detectives will not begin until a long time after the defense...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the demon who can predict the danger, this is a method that is quite conducive to their own characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the three churches plus the military and the royal family, there are many strong, sealed, and even the presence of demigods, there is no shortage of '0' and ' The 1' seal, the owner of the devil's dog, is sure that there is no ability or object to restrain his characteristics? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, he must not dare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official extraordinary forces, especially those who are night servants, punitives, and mechanical minds are organizations that have been fighting demons for years, in the Quaternary, and even more ancient In the third period, there will be no lack of similar deeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil's owner is at most the sequence 5, as long as the situation is a little, even if there is no problem, it may be shredded by the demigod or the horror seal. Why did he dare to make such an attempt? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, he simply teases the official organization, does not act, again and again...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Well, there is a possibility that he used more than half of the goals of the threatening letter to gather together, using the regular organization to check and balance each other, programmatic, bureaucratic tendency, and make a time difference...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack on Mr. Essinger Stanton must have been handed over to the mechanical heart responsible for the supernatural affairs of the Hillston area, but the last time the devil dog was killed was the night owl, both sides were in The details will definitely not be communicated in detail...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it may also be distributed according to Mr. Stanton’s faith... Which god does he believe in... I seem to I have never known, I have not seen it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, so many private detectives live in different districts and have different beliefs. The division of jurisdiction is one. It’s a headache, and joint action is not so easy to achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, taking over and secretly protecting us should be only two or three groups of official extraordinary people, at most to the deacon level, and not used too much Too dangerous a horror seal, the high sequence of the demigods did not so quickly look at this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will give the devil owner a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although three to four groups of official extraordinary people can definitely kill one, even more than one sequence of 5, but as long as he grasps the timing, there is still no small possibility Successfully separated afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just twenty or thirty seconds, Klein speculated two or three possibilities and each gave a preliminary judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminiscent of the divination results that are not too dangerous tonight, Klein thoughtfully lowered his head, closed the door, entered the living room, or sat or stood The detectives said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have an alarm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is almost the same time Half of the people in the discussion... He looked around and said silently at the bottom of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caslana answered instead of others:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some of the police, there are Trying to find Mr. Stanton or a familiar friend, and finally we gathered together and negotiated to visit your big detective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Ryan gently decapitated, deliberately said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone should not be too nervous, the person who sent the threatening letter should want to avenge the serial killer, but he has only one person, There are at most one or two companions, and we have a full eight detectives, and they are good at fighting and shooting. Why are you afraid of him?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not only those of us who were summoned by Mr. Stanton, but also those who received the threatening letter, but they did not meet you and did not come to visit me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing these words, Kaslana and her assistant Lydia had a look of doubt on their faces, and it seemed that something was not certain. Another detective took a breath: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
