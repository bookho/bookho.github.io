			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Xue Lun?" Dunn clearly knew the widow of the Baron Hoy, the most famous social flower in Tingen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Mayn’s wife looked at her thin lady who accompanied her to the Blackthorn Security Company and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thin black skirt black lady considers the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, snow Mrs. Lun, the wife of the old baron who died in the Hoy family, she, she..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stayed for a few seconds, the thin woman suddenly angered out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a blind man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this swearing, Klein suddenly remembered The "small dirty film" that I saw and the seemingly sturdy performance of Mrs. Xue Lun at that time made him convinced of the relevant rumors, and silently sympathized with the old baron who passed away:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that Mrs. Xue Lun can’t marry again, but this kind of chaos... Hey, the old baron’s grave is afraid of a green meadow...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun has no change in expression, sitting on the opposite sofa, whispering and saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this and her is not The criminal has nothing to do with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, I know that Mrs. Shelen is very influential in Tingen City, rashly following her, monitoring her, it is easy to cause unsolvable problems and very bad consequences. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a criminal!" said the thin lady, resentful. "She caused my brother's death, but her lover gave the police department a lot of pressure." Let them have to make the conclusion that my brother died suddenly because of excessive drinking and continuous indulgence. They are all criminals!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those...Klein Also sympathetic to the old baron for a second, and figured out the identity of the thin lady, she is the sister of Maynard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, this kind of scandal is definitely not going to bring the maid to come, or to be reassured by the family... he nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Maynard took the back of the thin woman’s hand, and the voice was low and coldly added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "She is a criminal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you suffer damage, I will help you solve it and make up for your loss."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tone...is the daughter of the New Party’s amnesty...if the police department is very confident about the result of my psychic, I am afraid I will succumb to her pressure... Ryan groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng En silent for a dozen seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... I still have a question You seem to be very sure what we can find out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skinny lady nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s the tobacco merchant Vickroll who introduced us. He praised you for being the top elite in the industry and able to accomplish tasks that others could not do.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tobacco Businessman Wickrol...what is this? Klein subconsciously looked to the captain and found that Dunn Smith was also full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am stupid, why do I expect the captain to remember this kind of thing... After all, I don’t remember it myself... He sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the two elite "mercenaries" look puzzled, the thin lady added another sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You saved his abducted son."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out to be him... The kidnapping case made me discover the Antignus family notes. Clue... Klein is amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, the thin lady opened the condition:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Tracking and monitoring that, the nephew for two weeks, even if she could not find evidence of her crime, she must record who went to her home, who she went to, and we will pay 50 pounds for this." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And if you can find evidence of her crime, or clues, we will pay an additional £200."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge commission.... Klein suddenly thought that he had used only 7 pounds to let Henry detectives collect so many red chimney houses, and he was somewhat ashamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng thought of the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, we can sign the contract now." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You need to pay 20 pounds in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, recently the staff is very nervous There is a big case of Llanus... Klein didn't expect Dunn Smith to promise this task, although he was quite a bit hearted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Maynard sighs first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe in you, please don't let me down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den smiled without speaking, turning Head to Rosanne: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going to draft a contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until the contract is signed Finished, the deposit was received, and Mrs. Maynard and the thin lady were left to leave the Blackthorn Security Company. Dunn looked sideways at Klein Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will hand it over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Klein looked blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not learning the skills of tracking and monitoring? This is a good practice opportunity, and it happens that the part you are responsible for in the Lalhous case is over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." Klein did not decline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he promised, his thoughts began to turn fast:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the regulations, the task fee Half of it was handed over to Mrs. Oliana, handed over to the treasury, and the rest was divided equally by the participating players, and this time, it seems that only me alone took over...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the success of the investigation, there is a 25-pound income, and its own salary is taken... If you can find some clues, you can get a full 125 pounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain is really wise! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean glanced at him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look for Leonard, Frye in the morning Learning tracking and monitoring skills, the afternoon fighting class is suspended, this week is suspended, um... I think you should have mastered it, I will send someone to inform Gao Wen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking for Leonard, Frye learning and tracking skills? How do you feel a little unreliable? Klein stunned. In his heart, the only way Leonard would adopt was to play the inner port, sing beautiful poems, seduce Mrs. Shelen to go to bed, and track closely. And monitoring, and Frye's temperament is very special, cold, gloomy, which makes him look at others regardless of where, how to track and monitor this image? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking and turning, Klein replied seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng gently decapitated and walked to the partition. Suddenly, he stopped and turned his body and hesitated:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... the original captain, you just remembered nothing, I don’t understand anything... why can you pretend so calmly and confidently! Klein reached for his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Leonard’s teaching, Klein is not in a hurry to follow Mrs. Shelen, even if he knows that he lives in Orsna Street in the Eastern District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before you don't figure out the rules of action of the target, it's very easy to track down the problem, and it's hard to observe everything by a single person's monitoring, unless you don't If you don't drink, don't sleep, don't go home." This is Leonard's original words, so Klein follows his instructions, go to the hound pub, find a gang leader, spend 5 pounds and ask him to send his men to take turns to monitor Mrs. Shelen. Record her daily actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this is reimbursable...how it feels like subcontracting... On Friday afternoon, Klein got the gang leader’s offer. Investigation report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an investigation report. It is obviously insulting those professional private detectives. The gangster’s leader does not have a word to know, relying on pictures and symbols. Instead, they read and read the semi-literate bosses of the school on a one-week Sunday. They saw that Klein’s head was in pain, and it took half a day to finish reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the monitoring, Mrs. Shelen has rarely been out recently, and few guests have visited... it should be affected by the death of Mr. Maynard... Those gang members are quite capable, and they are on the line with Madame Xuelun’s maid... Well, she is going to attend the Conservative Party’s banquet tonight, maybe she will go home very late, maybe not going back... This is A practical opportunity.” Klein quickly decided to sneak into Mrs. Shelen’s home tonight and quietly searched it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the end of his part of the Llanus case, the suspension of the fighting course, and the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qilingus incident came to an end, Ryan has only two things left to worry about recently. One is to check the red chimney house, and the other is to track and monitor Mrs. Shelen, so it is relatively free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Two days ago, he had received a reply from Mr. Azick, which had only one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I got the 'squirming hunger', I remembered something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Klein finally confirm that Zilingers is Mr. Azick got rid of it and finally confirmed that the amnesia teacher with a long life is a high-ranking strongman, but he did not dare to ask the other person to remember what was done with "squirming hunger", because Azick obviously did not want to say - - If he is willing to share, it will be described directly in the letter. In the reply, Klein reminded Mr. Azick that in addition to his greetings, "squirming hunger" would be eager for the flesh and soul of the living, and must find a safe Seal method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, "justice" and "downside down" still have not prayed to him, but Klein is no longer worried, understand that the two members are scruples may exist. Surveillance, regardless of rash mourning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night in Olsna Street, gas street lights shine flat The road, the moon of the blush is hanging high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean, who sneaked out of the door, used the balance and agility of the "clown" to silently turn over the wall of Mrs. Shelen’s house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the garden, to the side of the house, he climbed the tap water pipe and entered the balcony on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an alternative creation history for Klein, who has never been successful in climbing trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a tarot card from the pocket of the black trench coat. Klein inserted it into the balcony door and opened the latch with a light touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The servants are so big... they didn't even have extra locks, or else I could only try to open the window..." Klein whispered silently, flashing Into the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the information provided by the gang leader, he easily found Mrs. Shelen’s bedroom, twisted the handle, and sneaked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully close the door, he suddenly smelled a faint fragrance, reminding people of the bloody fragrance of women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
