Like drunk, he jumped into the bucket filled with ice, from the soles of his feet to the top of his head. Infiltrated into the coolness of the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? How could it be so weird? Daniz took a breath and forced himself to turn his head back to the back of German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that this crazy adventurer is getting faster and faster, so that he has to run small in order to keep up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the street, walking through the alley, Daniz suddenly saw a blue-green shadow falling from the tree. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, it covers the scales, twisting the slippery body, with a triangular head, spit a slender scarlet core, it’s not too short The poisonous snake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dog! How can there be a snake in this weather this season? Daniz is not afraid of this kind of creature, even roasting snake meat to eat, so that he is stimulated by this abnormal situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Troubled the snake that was wrapped around the place, Daniz looked down to the left and right, found the drains on both sides, the broken corners of the house, the surface Inside the rusted tap water pipe, there is a pair of icy, vertical, pupils of different colors looking out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz instinctively shuddered, only to feel that the scalp seemed to be tied up with dense needles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t dare to stay any longer, didn’t dare to leave, speeded up again, and followed Herman Sparrow’s. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he entered the "Azure Wind" hotel and climbed up the wooden stairs, he couldn’t help but look up and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his chest was stuffy and his breath was stagnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he is like diving into the sea, being squeezed by heavy water from all sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the faint ambiguity, Daniz heard the sound of the tidal wave, seeing the waves of Unreal cascading around the German Sparrow, as if A boundless blue ocean with no bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge, blue-blue figure in the ocean like a tower, which sets everything up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...Daniz’s right foot stopped in midair and couldn’t step on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar feeling, he is no stranger, the last time the pirate conference, "King of the Five Seas" Nast is more majestic, more horrible, almost all The pirates can't lift their heads, and only the strongmen of the military ranks can barely fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz is very clear that this is by no means the performance of German Sparrow itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other party is at the level of the demigod and the half man, hunting "steel" Maviti, there is no need to introduce "the penalty"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ocean...The tide...Daniz’s mind quickly flashed these two nouns, and immediately thought of the basic belief of the Rebels, "Poseidon" Tuva things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it true that when Greel Spalo touched the bone sword, he suffered the curse of 'Poseidon' due to unknown factors? The corpse of a believer who is completely devoid of water is one of the conditions for the curse to be launched. The driver of the previous year bowed and kissed the ground because he felt the breath of 'Poseidon'?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey...German Sparo is probably going to die here today...I want to escape a little, so as not to be affected, the most, the most, then come back and collect him...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe there is still a rescue, I use the 'Lingling Ceremony' to ask the captain, she knows so many strange secrets, should be able to solve this problem... No, Lord, 'The Spiriting Ceremony 'The conditions are within 500 nautical miles, they have to sail for at least one and a half days to enter this range..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein still didn't speak, and the dark brown eyes seemed to have a rich, almost black azure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went straight to the bedroom and slammed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi is outside, wants to run for a while, and feels that he can rescue the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bedroom, Klein closed his eyes and waited for an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he reversed four steps, each step accompanied by a mourning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burst of madness or sharp slang in his ear, and the spirit illusioned up and went straight into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, he heard a painful, difficult wording. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein appeared in the ancient palace and appeared at the top of the mottled long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the quiet fog, there is an illusory, huge blue-blue sea snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is placed in an ancient ruined relic, coiled on a half-pillared pillar, the head of the skull rises, and the bloody mouth opens, revealing a The root is more curved than the human arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the creamy white teeth, the blood is layered and the mucus flows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sea snake madly swayed its tail, picked up the horrible waves, swayed the exaggerated shackles, and made the entire ruin swaying, seemingly to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This picture is fragile and fast, no matter how big and unimaginable the sea snake struggles, it is difficult to reverse, only painful and long-lasting Light, annihilated in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat on the high back chair belonging to the "fool" and watched it all quietly. There was no extra action for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog is silently spreading, and the scene here seems to have never changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few tens of seconds, Klein leaned back on the back of the chair and sighed and spit out the other’s name:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Poseidon' Cavitowa..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After touching the bone sword, he already felt abnormal and In the dialogue with the "skinhead" Karat, keenly discovered that a small, weak but extremely high-spirited sinister evil power did not know when it invaded his body and slowly polluted his own soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the initiative and turned around, then realized that the evil power was connected with the surrounding, gradually strong, and connected a little unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he is distracted against the erosion, while controlling himself, not interacting with the surrounding,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein believes that as long as he reacts to anomalies on the way, the erosion will be more intense and even irreversible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally wanted to find a place nearby. The bathroom, with the help of fog shielding and isolation, melts away the evil and cold power, but after considering it again and again, it is decided to stay away from the area, because there are so many believers around the "Poseidon" that it is very likely to cause an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, Klein grasped one more point, that is, if you "explode" in advance, the power of "Poseidon" Cavitowa will be partially Remaining in flesh and blood, the consequences and effects are unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had to wait patiently for an opportunity, waiting for the cold and evil power to penetrate into his own spirit in order to "purify" in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminiscent of the whole thing, Kline finger tapped the edge of the table and whispered to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;“Not strong...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The character of “Poseidon” is much lower than he imagined! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this, Klein concluded that the "Poseidon" Cavitowa's personality is lower than the "渎神者" Amon - although the latter may be better at intrusion, but at the time it was only a avatar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was dropped by the "Lord of the Storm", or it was not an angel, it was only strong, and it could respond to believers within a certain range. Demi god? Klein wondered and found that the state of "Poseidon" Cavitowa was quite abnormal: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The foundation of the existence of this evil spirit is quite fragile and seems to collapse at any time. Disintegration...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, it and the ruins it is in, have the feeling of blending with the spirit world, because of this, they escaped the storm church. Cofferdam? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned back on the back of the chair, and there was a speculation between the vague.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Today's events are not accidental. They all stem from the fact that the archaeologist Latsia took away an important item from the forgotten temple. The situation of the 'Poseidon' Cavituva, which has been lingering, has deteriorated and it is difficult to maintain its existence for a long time... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It allows the believer to find the item while preparing for the survival of the possession. The bone sword should be derived from its demigod. The body hides a little power that it projects. If the target is right, it will invade the person inside the body, pollute the soul, establish coordinates, and let the spirit of itself transfer before dissipating...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, it's obviously not good at this kind of thing, um, it's not a snake of mercury, it can't self-circulate, it's a reincarnation, it's not like '渎神者' Amon, you can live in someone else. Within the soul, it is really necessary to occupy this body, which will only lead to the complete collapse of flesh and blood, creating a horrible monster. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this logical development, Cavitewa, who is on the verge of complete degeneration, will have a lot of crazy moves next... Klein frowns, no longer delays, Falling into the fog, returning to the real world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted the anti-lock, opened the door, entered the living room, and scared the sneak peek of Daniz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz looked up and down a few times, cautiously and alertly asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You ,is that OK? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein maintains the design of the German Sparrow, calmly replies:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Resolved. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved? Daniz looked left and right, and looked at the bedroom. He suspected that his previous feelings were all illusions, and there was no curse of "Poseidon". .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did he do in the bedroom? It took only a minute or two to lift the curse of "Poseidon"? Hey, this guy is not a secret... Daniz Going back two steps and letting the road open.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the table with little debris, the "skinhead" Karat sitting in the iron wheelchair looked regretfully at the tattoo male Edmonton: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a pity what. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a little...he didn’t pick it up, just touched it. Edmonton also sighed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karate looked at the slightly curved bone sword and said to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When an outsider picks up this holy sword, God will reproduce in the earth..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edmonton followed After squatting, it seems to be confessing to the gods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time passes by, Karat and Edmonton suddenly heard two screams.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They looked up and found that two of their companions were straight down, and the skin was like weathered rock, losing all the water.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karate and Edmonton looked at each other and felt some strange atmosphere.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
