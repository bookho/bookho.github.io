			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian Gray did not make Foers wonder. This one-month correspondence has already made her mentally prepared. At the Tarot meeting, I consulted the experienced "inverted man", and it was normal to grasp what kind of expression and reaction to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there really a kind of extraordinary person?" Fols "suddenly" asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian nodded lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and saw no one nearby, so he walked over to a tree with fallen leaves and put his hand on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian’s figure suddenly blurred, as if it had turned into a reflection in the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is clear, he has appeared behind the tree and his posture has not changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God! This is really, it’s amazing!" Foers remembers the teachings of Mr. "Down Man" and "Meaning", half of his mouth The round opened and exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian came back and smiled and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to be such extraordinary "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Think!" Folsic was silent, "excited" to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, to become a peripheral member of the Abraham family, many things will become easier in the future! Her heart is filled with sincere joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian laughed, sinking his face, solemnly asking again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are willing Be my student?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fols nodded frequently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“willing!”< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian breathed a sigh of relief and immediately ridiculed himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not a good The teacher even taught, oh, there is no need to mention the previous things. In short, you should not expect too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this time Considering that he decided to learn from his previous experiences and lessons, he did not tell Firth about the Abraham family, and only treated the relationship between the two parties as simple teachers and students, so that you don’t have to worry about the other ones. Super magical items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, your explanation of mysterious knowledge is very good, really, Mr. Gray, no, teacher." Foers quickly determined the relationship between the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian looks out to the tombstone and shakes his head and exhales:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't intend to teach again Student, but your noble character has infected me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If nothing happens, today I will be able to give you the corresponding potion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today? "Firth asked in surprise.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she went to Beckland to pick up Dorian Gray, she found that the other person only mentioned a small one. The suitcase is barely enough to hold a change of laundry. There is no evidence that he has carried extraordinary materials.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he have his own resources in Beckland? , belonging to the resources channel of the Abraham family? Fols has vague speculation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She originally planned to rely on the inconvenience of the two places, will get The "apprentice" potion extraordinary material was sold, and then told the other party to successfully promote to the extraordinary, so that she can get a lot of cash supplements, can also avoid repeating the "apprentice" potion, have to spend some time The sad result of digestion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "Dorian did not explain, pointing to the other direction. "Let's go to see Lauro and Alisa first. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past more than a month, he has been promoted to the "Sheriff's Officials" in order to repay the heavy debts he has shouldered. He goes out early every day and tries to get every bounty that he can get. So, near noon, she has no doubt. The land is not at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a quiet room?" Dorian looked around with ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot." Fols led the new teacher into the living room on the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian walked around the room to confirm the environment, and then ordered Folsch to light a candle with a deep red sandalwood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed the door and pulled the curtains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dim swaying room, he walked over to the front of the candle and took out two bottles of essential oils such as water and some common herbal powders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a ceremony? Shouldn't it be three candles? Fols was curious and watched, and did not rush to open it, as if it had been shaken by this atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the completion of the ceremony, Dorian took a step back and changed his face to the ancient Hermes language:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I call in my name:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" A strange spirit that travels in the upper bounds, a virtual creature that loves music, and a contractual partner of Dorian Gray Abraham."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden wind in the living room, with a crying trembling, and the swaying candlelight was dyed with a blue color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lap of light leaps fast and seems to form a door beyond the normal concept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of semi-real and semi-real spherical things flew out from the "bottom" of the aperture,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp It is milky white, with no eyes, nose, arms, legs and feet, and only cracks a gap in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian showed a clear smile, opened his mouth and sneaked a lullaby with a folk flavor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "ball" suddenly swayed from side to side, making it extremely comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a song, Dorian put his hand over:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Malmous Give me the items that I deposited with you the day before yesterday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "ball" jumped up and down, the body swelled, and the "mouth" was extremely Big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, it spits out two singular and extraordinary materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still like this... Firth looks at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian picked up the main material of the "apprentice" potion, interrupted the summoning, and ended the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and smiled at Fols:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even in the spiritual world, Marmo Such virtual creatures are also very rare. Under normal circumstances, the summons cannot point to them. There must be an elder with a high enough sequence to enter the spiritual world. After long-term search, they must enter into a contract with one of them to make the descendants correspond. The call is completed in the name.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the Nether creature comes over, the contract can be re-established, and they are closely connected with themselves and no longer called by others. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out to be like this... it sounds very interesting! "Fuls said from the heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is difficult to contain the future:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't consider the full moon curse, and don't consider the situation where the ordinary extraordinary is under pressure and always at risk, it is really a wonderful thing to explore this wonderful world... I hope that one day, I can really travel to the spiritual world... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Malmos's biggest role is that you can swallow a lot of things into your stomach without causing any harm to them. This is equivalent to a mobile, hidden, almost unrecognized warehouse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, you can't store too much, its belly is limited, and it doesn't like people who don't have musical talent, and will refuse to sign contracts with similar people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, at least I will play the lyre...Fuls just breathed a sigh of relief and was ordered by Dorian to find a black-and-black stew. Pot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the other side where the potion is being dispensed, her expression does not seem to change, but her heart is crying for an accident.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to drink an "apprentice" potion again! It will waste a lot of time! I know this, I will be honest, honest... Now I say, it’s too late, Teacher Gray There should be divination, but it is disturbed. The frankness means that there must be a strong person behind me. Some people instructed... there was a lot of thoughts. Fols saw Dorian turning around and handing a bottle of bubbling bubbles. Potions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Drink it, you can be extraordinary. "Dorion used a plain but tempting tone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he comforted Folse:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, there is no problem with me here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well! "Falth bit his teeth, took the "apprentice" potion, and drank it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, she flashed a sentence: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honesty is the most valuable quality...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage stopped outside the Eastern District, and Kline, with his cane and hat, entered a wide slum from a relatively poor neighborhood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he saw two familiar figures coming out of the neat apartment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are all girls, one seventeen eight Years old, a fifteen or six-year-old, is the daughter of the women who wash the women, Lie Fu, and Daisy, who were once kidnapped by Kapyeong and rescued because of the "black emperor" incident.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wuxi also found Klein, and immediately revealed a bright smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Moriarty detective! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and daggered, slightly surprised to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just, you Didn't you go to a public elementary school? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the appeal of reporters such as Mike Joseph and the promotion of the Church of the Night God, the Beckland City Government established a charitable fund with the property of Kapyeong. Specialized to help women and families who have been harmed by Karping.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Daisy family used this opportunity to move from the dilapidated apartment with a bad public security environment to the edge of the eastern district. From one room to two rooms, the "laundry workshop" and the place to sleep and eat are separated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Daisy has also entered The compensation for reading in public primary schools, the tuition fee of 3 pence per week and the corresponding meal supplement are the responsibility of the charity fund, which makes her very happy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is strange It is precisely because public primary schools only have a rest on Sundays, and this point should not appear here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The school is very close, I take a break at noon, come back to help Leia sent the cleaned clothes to the guest's home. She and her mother were busy. Come. "Yuxi calmly replied.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most direct impact of her going to school is that Liv and Fryia can reduce the amount of clothing that can be washed every day, and the family income drops significantly. If Mike’s reporters have helped to apply for charitable fund subsidies, they simply cannot maintain their current lives.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
