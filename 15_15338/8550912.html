			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Writer?" Audrey observes Grein's reaction and asks a random question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next topic is normal, she did not evade Anne, who is next to the close-knit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glylint straightens his body, hehe laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I want You should have seen her work, and I have been widely praised by Stormwind Villa in the last two months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like this book, especially like cool 茜Ms. Yu.” Audrey replied with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, she turned her eyes on her hypocrisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because her recent hobby is not a novel at all, and the reading progress of Stormwinds has been stagnation in one-third of the position for nearly a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since joining the Tarot Society, I have met a powerful fool and become a truly extraordinary person. She is integrating her own mysterious knowledge and systematic learning psychology. The content of the aspect lacks sufficient interest in other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gregort Viscount led Audrey to the living room with a sofa and said with a smile:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I am sure that you will have a good impression of Ms. Fols. Wall, because she is as calm, intelligent, and lazy as Ms. Yu in the Stormwind Villa." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, my dear Miss Audrey, wait until we play the piano for us. This is the best award for literature and novels." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey looked at Glylint’s side face, feeling his emotions from his expression, tone and certain body movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants me to be the capital he shows off... Audrey seems to think like this friend for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She maintains an elegant smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My music teacher, pianist Vika Mr. Nal thinks that my recent level has dropped significantly and I need more practice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All right." Glylint was trying to say something, Suddenly I saw a woman who went to the long table to eat dessert. "Audrey, this is Ms. Fols. Wall, the author of "Storm Mountain Villa.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Audrey looked up and saw that the woman, Mrs. Fols, was about twenty-three or four years old, and she was wearing a beige, ruffled collar. The skirt, brown hair and draped, the pale blue eyes turned over because of the introduction of Glylint, with a bit of a playful smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no more than three seconds of observation, Audrey noticed a lot of small details:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mrs. Fols's fingers have traces of scented yellow... She likes cigarettes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The position of the pen is clearly thick, consistent with The identity of the author..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her arm movements show that she has good strength, this is not a feature that a writer should have, unless she loves exercise, or This is what happened by nature, or has been engaged in another profession..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her "Storm Mountain Villa" presents a calm, rational and precise style, and her There must be a certain relationship in the previous occupations..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is now relaxed in her eyes and expressions, and there is a feeling of overlooking me and Glenlin. Is this the psychological advantage that extraordinary people have for ordinary people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If she was accidentally discovered by Glylint If she is the identity of the individual, then she will definitely have some cramped and uneasy emotions. After all, she cannot guess the reaction and subsequent development of the other party, and the unknown will bring fear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"...This shows that she took the initiative to contact Glylint and learned about our hobbies in advance, and has some certainty about the next thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;At this time, Glylint is introducing to Firth: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms. This is the Miss Audrey I mentioned, she is Baekeland. The most dazzling gem of Germany, her father is Count Earl, a member of the House of Lords who is trusted by the king and respected by the nobility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon Ms. Foers, your "Storm Mountain Villa" is still on my bed. "Audrey took a ceremony in strict accordance with the rules of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, she silently added in her heart: That is because I have not read it for a month...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falth is simple and courteous:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Miss Audrey, your beauty is really impressive, I think I have With the material of the next novel, oh, Viscount Glylint also praises you for having outstanding musical talent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the vast audience, both sides are only chilling A few words, did not say anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Flowserve continued to go to the table, aiming at a small cake with cream, Audrey took back the line and followed Greerlin to the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She recalls the details she has just seen, trying to accurately grasp the other’s ideas and win the initiative for later contacts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A step forward, as cold as a neutral audience, Audrey stepped on the hanging skirt, and the body swayed and almost fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the close-fitting maid Anne had prepared to hold her back and saved her good image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss, the unique design of this dress requires you not to go too fast." Annie leaned into Audrey's ear and lowered her voice to remind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Audrey's face rose red and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just focused too much on observing others, forgetting to pay attention to my feet... She complained in her heart. In the salon afterwards, Audrey has always had an elegant and sweet smile in front of the diligent writers, critics and musicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the cheek muscles began to sore, she accepted the suggestion of Viscount Glylint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, she used the bathroom as an excuse to lift the skirt, slowly stood up and left the salon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there is no sight to chase herself, she wanders around the study on the first floor and talks to the personal maid Annie:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have something to discuss with Grein, you hold at the door and let no one else come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good Anne didn't feel strange because she knew that her own lady and Viscount Glylint had the same hobbies and often exchanged mysterious things privately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the study and locking the door, Audrey saw Glalint sitting behind the table, playing with a pen, and Fols Walley In front of the bookshelf, look at the books at will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Re-introduction, Ms. Fols, a real extraordinary." Glylint put a pen and greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Audrey deliberately showed her suspicions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls put the book back to its original position and turned to laugh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I need to prove myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked slowly to the door, extended her right palm, and pressed her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, Audrey’s eyes, it seems that Ms. Fols has turned into a phantom and penetrated the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her heart was horrified, and she looked at it again and found that Forth was no longer in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a magical ability." Glylint praised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey took a sigh of relief:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no doubt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the ability of Forth’s performance also allowed her to confirm the other’s true thoughts, because no matter how much money or material, it’s hard to beat such extraordinary people. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glylint’s home is not guarded by extraordinary people...Fuls is hoping to accomplish something with the identity and resources of Glylint? Audrey tried to make herself like an audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folse laughs at two channels:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us communicate honestly, stay There is not much time for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to be a clinic doctor and became an extraordinary person in a chance. It has exceeded today. Two years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that you will do one thing for me, and the reward I give is to lead you into the circle of truly extraordinary people and sell them to you. The formula of the sequence of potions and the corresponding materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing such a promise, Glylint can't wait to ask:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a companion who is in jail, waiting for the final trial, I I hope that you can save her, no matter what method." Fols succinctly described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey frowned slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Fols, you show it The ability should be very suitable for doing this kind of thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls shook his head and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, it is not like this, where I can pass, she can't pass, I can only go in and see her, and talk to her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And I think that adventure rescue is not a good idea, life is very short, and there are a lot of things to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey observes each other's face And the body, ask at the discretion: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand. Your companion was detained for what crime?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fols's expression suddenly became awkward:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My companion is actually very respectable and makes people think from the bottom of their hearts. To obey, her character is noble and kind, sly, forehead, It’s just that when you are convincing a villain, the method you take is a bit too...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After entrusting the task, Klein kept the schedule of morning mystery and afternoon fighting practice. The law of life made him almost forget that he was a night-time person, and the "curse" that always encounters extraordinary events often seems to Disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, it was his turn to be on the door of Chanis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The black tea in the coffee and civilian office I stayed here, you can enjoy it at will." Dunn swept the duty room with a faint ashes Circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who had compiled a reason to explain to his brother and sister in advance, nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Okay, Captain, you are a generous gentleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This will help you relax your spirits, too tight for your health."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took his hat and carried his cane and walked slowly Doorway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
