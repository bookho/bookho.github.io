			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the undulating waves of the Sunia Sea, the "Aurora Blue Avenger" is like a leaf, sometimes thrown high, sometimes it is rolled up, but There is no sign of overturning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger Wilson stood in the captain's room, facing back with a shelf of red and white wine, and took a few steps unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he bit his teeth, and he returned to the mahogany desk with a serious expression, took off the brass sextant, and found the paper and pen. It depicts the complex, mysterious symbol of the "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the memory of the "voyager", Alger quickly completed the first step of the sacrifice ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he opened the drawer, took out the candle, arranged it according to the "binary method", and placed one in the "innocent eye" and "twisted" Above the symbol of the "line", one is in the center, indicating the sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After picking up the debris on the table, "Down Man" Alger condensed the water on the palm of his hand, wiped the altar and used the ritual silver plaque. Reluctantly created a sealed wall around the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he ignited the two candles with spirituality and stepped back in the dim light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instinctively took a breath, Alger lowered his head and mourned in ancient Hermes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "A fool who does not belong to this age;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the mysterious ruler above the fog;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the king of yellow and black in charge of good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your faithful servant prays for your gaze;"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for your acceptance of his dedication;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for you to open the door to the kingdom."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ancient mantra reverberates within the wall of spirituality, igniting the gale of the hover The shock of natural forces came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the oldest ritual language created by the extraordinary human beings. It contains many mysteries, but it lacks sufficient protection for users. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger endured the pain of the skin being scratched by a knife, took a dark brown glass vial from his pocket, unscrewed the lid, and poured out a lot of shapes. Granules of sesame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These particles flow with metallic luster and have an indescribable aesthetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger sprinkled the particles and sprinkled them into the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is getting more and more exciting, but it is no longer cool, and it is dyed in silver and dark black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the constant collision and the continuous fusion, the two colors of different colors are put into the candle that symbolizes the "fool", which expands and tears out a normal size. The illusory door, the symbol on its surface is exactly the one that Alger just described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Klein above the fog is seeing the door that he has seen before the high back chair, and feels the power of spirituality. A wave of waves swayed to stimulate this mysterious space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that... Klein’s sudden hunch, immediately spreads out its own spirituality, adding shock and excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unrealistic voice, the slamming door slowly opened! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger in the captain’s room suddenly saw the illusory door made of wind and light open, and the back was deep darkness, a mysterious shadow that was innumerable and hard to describe. It is a clear glory that contains a huge amount of knowledge. It is a dense fog above them. It is an ancient palace overlooking the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was busy picking up the colorful lizard dragon pituitary that had been prepared for a long time. He held his head in a low-pitched posture with both hands, and handed the piece of the palm-sized thing that was constantly changing and colored, soft and musky, to the illusory In front of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holly emerged and instantly disappeared in the suction, Alger's hands became lighter, losing the slight tingling sensation brought by the pitted body of the colorful lizard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t dare to look up until the low voice of the “fool” swayed in his ear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Doing a good job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my pleasure." Alger replied without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked forward again, only to see the illusory door disappeared, the gale stopped, and the candlelight returned to its original state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the normal process of extinguishing the candle, the "hanging man" Alger sat down in a complicated way, silently saying:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the beginning, you can only pull people into the world above the fog... After a while, you can listen and pray and respond... Now you can accept the sacrifice and give it... Mr. 'Footer' step by step to get rid of the predicament and go deep into the real world little by little?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conclusion makes Alger afraid and worried. A little fortunate expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least I am a member of the Tarot Club, the earliest member... He sighed with a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magnificent palace above the fog, Klein is playing The pituitary gland of the colorful lizard, the face is reflected in a variety of colors, alternating colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tactile sensation of micro-stinging came from the palm of his hand, and a strong sense of accomplishment filled his heart, giving him a real smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the future, Tarot will be more 'magical'..." With a sigh of relief, Klein extended his spirituality and passed his ideas to the symbol of "Justice" The deep red star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the bedroom, Audrey can no longer sit quietly beside the bed, she sometimes flips through the books next to her pillow, and sometimes her eyes are not focused enough to look at it. Oneself in a pair of glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is looking forward to the completion of the "downside down" sacrifice ceremony, and fear that the result is a failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell the Great said that in the face of important things, you must calm down... Audrey, come, take a deep breath... or go to tease the dog? However, Su Shi can talk and think, it is a self-respecting creature, can't just tease... Audrey has a wide range of thoughts, and unconsciously holds a gorgeous puppet with exquisite workmanship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, there was a thick fog in front of her eyes, and there was a high chair in the depths of the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Fool" sat there and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss justice, try already Success, are you ready for spiritual materials?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awesome! It is worthy of Mr. "Folly"! Audrey throws the "upside down man" aside and curbs her own excitement: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I have always had similar materials around me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even before joining the Tarot, Audrey was like this, but at that time she was not sure which materials were considered spiritual, just according to the collection. The various incense essential oil formulas are constantly being carried from the family treasure house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gently sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When do you want to hold a ceremony?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The premise is to confirm that there are no extraordinary people around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extraordinary dogs are not counted...Audrey Looking at the closed door with guilty conscience:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein "hmm": "br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ritual process is the same as I described earlier, just need to change the prayer statement to:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your faithful servant prays for your gaze;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for you to open the door to the kingdom;"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for your strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, use the dual ritual method."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey recalled it again, restrained the urge to nod and began to prepare for the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the illusory door is wide open, and when it is more dreamy than the starry sky, Audrey feels that her body and mind are drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the mysterious world I have been pursuing, this is the feeling I always wanted! She sincerely praised the words "Mr. Fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a belief in the goddess, is a cult to the "fool" Mr. Audrey in his heart silently defended himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followingly, she suddenly saw that there was more of the same thing on the altar, constantly changing the color, and the soft things covered with the hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pituitary body of the colorful lizard!" Audrey's heart is happy, his eyes are bright, he is going to take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her etiquette habit immediately controlled her, and Audrey once again sincerely praised Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ending the ceremony, she couldn’t wait to go forward, and carefully observed the extraordinary material five times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our Tarot will be one level higher than all hidden organizations..." Audrey was proud of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, she looked at the door with caution, seemingly afraid that Su Shi suddenly broke in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will continue to work hard to prepare the potion and complete the promotion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Audrey’s hands have a lot of bottle gloss that seems to be able to shine into everyone’s heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She confidently drank this bottle of "reader" potion, successfully passed the stage of integration of extraordinary characteristics, and was promoted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a lot clearer in the eyes, and the extra has increased a lot. Audrey is familiar with the meditation of the distracted spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sequence is stable, she smiles at her mouth, walks briskly to the door, puts the golden retriever in, and sees Su Shi’s dog’s face Suspicious expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have spent more time than ever." Su Shi did not hide his thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey sat on the ottoman and laughed twice, shifting the topic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Susie, you said, how can I tell Hugh and Fulth about something in a hidden way that doesn't expose myself, and let them be interested in it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The words are not finished, Audrey himself began to seriously ponder the task that Mr. "fool" explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, she looked at Su Shi, Su Shi looked at her, one person and one dog, and fell into contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein who has completed the scheduled goal returns to reality and sleeps a little An hour and hurriedly went out, spending 1 pound to buy gold-rimmed glasses for camouflage, wigs and various beards that can be pulled down. This is the need for his disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before dinner, he went to the easternmost district of Zhi’an, the most chaotic population, renting a one-bedroom house, renting 4 Sule 3 pence per week , one-time payment for two weeks, and the same amount of deposit, a total of 17 soler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
