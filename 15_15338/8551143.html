			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time passed smoothly, Tingen sent away the summer tail, and in mid-August, the temperature stabilized at 26 degrees Celsius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein suddenly stood up from the bathtub and stepped out to bring the drops of water drops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood there naked, looking down at his abdomen, and with a little force, he saw the lines of the muscles of the block clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the result of his insistence on training during this time. In addition, the whole person seems to be much more spiritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just today, his fighting teacher, Gao Wen, began to teach him basic boxing and power skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪,啪,啪, Klein’s feet are stepping on the floor of the bathroom, sometimes slipping forward, sometimes retreating, sometimes flashing right, with a punch And the action of the block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, he stopped, sighed with delight, took the towel next to him and wiped himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than two weeks after contacting the madhouse doctor Dast Gudrian, Klein seemed to get rid of the coincidence and left the strange circle that always met the extraordinary event. Life has become stable, and the salary has been led step by step. In-depth study of occultism, practice shooting and fighting, transplant and develop new dishes, and a piece of decent tableware and furnishings with my brother Benson sister Melissa, to the captain. Dunn, teammate Leonard and others asked for extraordinary cases in the past, as well as to the club to help people divination, and strictly follow the rules that they have summed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes his mind calm, if it’s not in the dead of night, he will miss the earth, if it’s not the red chimney, it’s still not clear, if it’s not a doom The pattern that is passed occasionally appears in a dream, and he has to get used to it and mourn the present life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the "Talo Club" was called three times, and Klein did not get a new Russell Diary, but according to "Justice", she is new I have met two extraordinary people and are naturally contacting them. When I enter the circle, I should be able to trade more Russell diaries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "upside down" also said that he has returned to the land, is processing some affairs, as soon as he is idle, he immediately began to look for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, "justice" feels that the two extraordinary people she knows are all worthy of development. For example, each has a good face protection, each has Certain, non-similar resource channels, each with its own persistence and characteristics, are not the kind of people who will sell secrets at will. The only problem is that they only have sequence 9, which is not suitable for the high-end strictness of the Tarot Club. The hidden organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-end organization? I feel more like MLM... At that time, the "fool" Klein only wanted to cover up and sigh. She felt that she could not find a language to deal with Miss Justice. She could only promise to let her go further to the two extraordinary people. Observation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, "justice" is not the first innocent and romantic girl. She cautiously did not mention the names and characteristics of the two extraordinary people, afraid to "fall down" Hang people" to find out according to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Justice said that she clearly felt the signs of the digestive digestion. Maybe for another three or four weeks, she could complete the 'audience'..." The formula of 'Person's has to be put on the agenda..." Klein, who wiped his body, put the towel aside and wore close-fitting clothes, thinking about the things on the Tarot Club the day before yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past twenty days, he only met Dr. D'Dust Gooding, and he only talked about the idea of ​​not being able to reach speed. Talk about each other's status and ask the psychological alchemy to do something irrelevant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the speed of "justice" digesting the potion, he had to wonder how to get the sequence 8 "reader" formula from Dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One button up the shirt button, Klein picked up another dry towel and wrapped it around the head to absorb the moisture on the short hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with "Justice", he is only slow to digest the "Divination" potion. By this week, there is no meditation or mental state. Then I heard that I shouldn’t hear the sound and see things that shouldn’t be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My summary of the 'Divination Code' is really effective. Next week... I should be able to completely digest the potion next week... The Hornacs Grey Goat in the 'Clown' formula has a crystal and a face rose. Know where to get it... Maybe you can learn Ms. Dai Li and submit a special application... but that will definitely be the focus of the upper level... I just want to grow awkwardly... Aurora will also be found in the police department, but still I don't know who Mr. Z is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Henry said that he could complete the 'Red Chimney' commission by the end of the week... My private money returned to the £7 No, don't worry about how to pay the last payment..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Some of the houses and guest information he gave before did not see any problems, I have no time to check them one by one. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you can see which house with red chimney has recently changed the guest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, this is an idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp; sit still for twenty or thirty seconds, he put on gray-black trousers, put on a bow tie, buckle the gun bag, throw the replaced knight exercise suit into the laundry basket, open the door and walk out of the bathroom - he just finished Wednesday It didn’t take long for the fighting training in the afternoon, still in the home of the teacher Gao Wen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Moretti." Gao Wen's miscellaneous maid just passed by and was busy with a ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded slightly, pointing to the messy wet bathroom:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trouble you Clean up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my duty, the clothes will be handled by the woman who washes the pulp, and she will come at six." The miscellaneous maid lowered her head and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powdering women workers do not eat and live, and the rewards are very low, so they will not be employed only in one family, often contracting the clothing of some nearby residents Or, rush to catch up every day, wash the family and go to another family immediately, or collect them all at home and deal with them, and send them back in order. Only then can they barely survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t say much more, came to the living room and said goodbye to the owner sitting in the rocking chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw two whispers of Gaowen without any anger to beheaded, with a light brown blanket on his legs and a copy of Ajo in his hand. Wa Evening News. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein knows that the man who is bathed in the sun in the west is just in his early fifties, but he seems to be eighty or ninety years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the usual fighting training, Gao Wen also kept silent. He only spoke at the point of the instruction. He definitely didn’t talk too much, and Klein was tired every day. To die and live, there is no desire to actively talk, so the relationship between the two sides is still cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at Gao Wen’s demonstration, his strength is still quite amazing, the pace is also agile enough, hitting me three estimates is not a problem... he has a policeman The salary given by the office, in the villages of the suburbs of Tingen, also bought a piece of land, can charge a fixed rent... He hired a chef, a miscellaneous maid, a pulp-washing woman... a big country of eating on earth, The 50-60-year-old who has such a family has traveled to the world as early as..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took his eyes back from Gao Wen and shook his head, then Came to the coat rack and took off his half-high silk hat and black thin windbreaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing neatly, he took a cane, walked out of the house, and approached the gate along a slate road with weeds on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw a two-wheeled carriage outside the iron fence and stood a familiar man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leonard?" Klein looked puzzled at the messy night teammates and whispered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard was wearing a white shirt, black trousers and unbuttoned boots, his hand was spinning his hat, and he saw Klein coming out, smiling. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surprise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard puts the hat on the road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain Jean You cooperate with me and Frye, we will go into detail on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein followed the other side into the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the scenery on both sides swept back, Leonard picked up the briefcase next to him and threw it across the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein steadily caught the file, took it out and read it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At 11 pm on August 11th, the bankrupt Sorce attempted to set fire to the tragedy in the Western District Almshouse, but eventually burned himself..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At 10 pm on August 11th, docker Zide jumped into the Tsock River, ending the poor life..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At 8:00 pm on August 11th, Mrs. Laughes, who lives on the Iron Cross Street and eats a matchbox, is dying of illness..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw the first two things, Klein wondered that a similar death was too ordinary. Common, not only should not be valued by the night, even the police department must avoid the waste of police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you look down, he gradually frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through two pages, he suddenly raised his head and looked at Leonard:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is this too much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the normal number of deaths is astonishing, it is hard to be normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard is in a rare position:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The deaths in the past two weeks are Five times the normal value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem was discovered during the statistics of the Tingen City Police Headquarters, and the matter was handed over to us and handed over to the generation. The penalty and the heart of the machine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the initial verification of these deaths is no problem, the captain thinks we have to check it again, and this may require divination. Or the aid of ritual magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stunned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard screamed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, you and Frye In the group, he waited for us at the Iron Cross Street, a group of Sijia, Luoyao and Lao Neil, and investigated the corresponding incident in the North District. The captain stayed in the security company to deal with the accident."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Enzhen focused on it and suddenly remembered one thing. He quickly asked, "Can I go back home and leave a note?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has to tell My brother and sister have something tonight, not at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, just drop the way."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was determined to look at the deaths again, trying to find associations at different points in time from different names of different deaths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at him, he thought:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I became after the night The first collective task? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: Regarding a plot of yesterday, say two words without spoiling, if I want to force Klein not to open the vision, so as to miss Observe, then I will use a softer and less uncomfortable way, such as opening a vision, but nothing is found, or just a small mental problem, so there are enough reasons to explain later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
