			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, in the outskirts of the North District, a two-story house with a simple style and a long history of disrepair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, a trainee inspector’s uniform, looked at the weedy gardens and the walls that climbed a lot of plants, and looked slightly at the side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My fighting teacher lives here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fighting that can be picked up by the night squad The home must be very good. ............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Mitchell, who led him, smiled low:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't despise Mr. Gao Wen because of his living environment. Although he did not get the title in the end, he used to be a real knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Speaking of this, the poet's temperament night who wears white shirts, black trousers and buttonless boots is suddenly full of sentimental:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is active In the last glorious era of the Cavaliers, the warriors wearing breastplates rushed toward the array of muskets and artillery, destroying their opponents and leveling the front. Unfortunately, they soon ushered in a high-pressure steam rifle and six tubes. After the invention and installation of the machine gun, the knights gradually withdrew from the stage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Gao Wen is also like this, more than twenty years ago, he was The Akhova Knights have encountered the army of the most advanced weapons in the Republic of Intis... Hey, whenever I think of this, I seem to have touched the dust of history, shocked by the vicissitudes and fate that cannot be reversed, and there are poems in my heart. In brewing, in the surging, however, I will not write poetry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Then what do you say so much? Klein pretended not to hear Leonard's self-deprecating, serious and serious suggestion: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My college classmate told me that writing poetry is a very necessary The gift of talent, it is best to start from reading "The Early Classical Poetry Collection of Lun"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard’s emotions change and change the way :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already bought this collection of poems, as well as books such as "Russell Poetry", I will try to make myself a midnight The poet, Mr. Diviner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is hinting at...playing the law? Klein seemed to answer nothing without understanding: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you still need grammar books."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, let's go in." Leonard reached out and pushed the half-covered iron fence door to the house along the road that could be paralleled by two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet close, Klein saw the main entrance open, and a tall man came out of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His blond hair is very short, two eyes have appeared white, the skin on the face has traces of wind and frost infestation, and the head-up pattern, crow's feet and decree lines are deep and obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" asked the middle-aged man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Gao Wen, according to the contract you signed with the police department, our trainee inspector will follow you to learn to fight." Leonard smiled and explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fighting? The current era does not need to learn to fight." Gao Wen looked at Klein with a slightly muddy eyes, said in a deadly voice, "You should practice pulling Guns and shooting, master the most advanced weapons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a psychological shadow cast by six-barrel machine guns and high-pressure steam rifles? Klein did not respond recklessly, looking at Leonard with a funny face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the police, fighting is still a subject that must be mastered. Most of the criminals we face are not demons who must be executed immediately. They don't even There must be weapons, and this time you need fighting skills." Leonard had prepared to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gao Wenyin’s face, silenced for more than a dozen seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You give it a try Punch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who didn’t have a cane, recalled the boxing match he had seen in his life, raised his arm and swung forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gao Wen’s mouth was slightly invisible and he thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Kicking.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Half-side body, licking the ankle, Klein tightened his thigh and pulled out his right foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough..." Gao Wen put his hand against his mouth and coughed twice, looking at Leonard. "I will abide by the contract, but In his case, the first month, only four times a week, three hours each time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a fighting expert, you decide Leonard nodded without hesitation, smiled at Klein, "See you at dinner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he got out of the iron fence gate, Klein was curious.道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, where should I start practicing? Punch, or footsteps?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp As a qualified keyboard player, he knows that the pace of fighting is also very important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaowen’s hands hang on both sides of his body, and his head swayed heavily:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is most needed is strength exercises.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Seeing there? There are two iron dumbbells, they are your companions today.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides, you also need to practice squats, running and skipping, and we come together in groups."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wake of Klein, his voice suddenly rose, and the majesty asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you understand?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understood!" At this moment, Klein felt that he had returned to military training and faced an inhumane instructor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First go and change the clothes, there is a set of knight exercise clothes on the sofa." Gao Wen suddenly sighed, turned his back and turned to the iron black Dumbbells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 6 pm, the corner of the oldville restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Frye of the Chanis Gate, the members of the Blackthorn Security Company are all in line, with a total of six nights and five civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white tablecloth is quietly laid on the long table, the waiters are carrying a plate of food, they cut first and then sent to each In front of the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw the steak with black pepper sauce, saw the bacon, saw the sausage with mashed potatoes, saw the custard, saw the aloe, saw The characteristic cheese, I saw the amber champagne, but he didn't have any appetite, and the afternoon training made him almost spit it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After aiming at the whitish, stunned new-nighter, Dunn picked up the red wine in front of him and smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us welcome new members, Klein Moretti, toast!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coolly introverted black Ms. Luo Yao. Lai Ting, the short and insane "sleeper" Cohen Li. White, the unspoken man of the sling, Leonard Mitchell, and the white-haired black-night "Midnight poet" Siga Thong, Qi Qi Toast, looking to the new teammates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein endured the discomfort of training, took the amber champagne and stood up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clinks one by one with each of the nights, and sipping up a small amount of champagne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At this time, does our writer Miss say nothing?" Dunn smiled and looked at Siga. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sieca.Tang is a 30-year-old woman, looks quite ordinary, but her temperament is outstanding, quiet and peaceful, plus her rare Long white hair, quite a bit of unique charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened to the old Neil, the "midnight poet" amateur is a fan of novels, and tried to vote for newspapers and magazines, but unfortunately only Several tabloids were passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siegel smiled and saw Dunn glance: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to make your name "Miss Writer" become a fact, Captain, I think you should special I have a fee to pay for the novel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun’s booth laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You should learn from Old Neal and find a more suitable reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this regard, I admire Mr. Neil most!" Swallow a piece of roast leg of lamb and lick the appendix. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the people talking and laughing, Leonard looked at Klein and chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Too tired, no appetite, can't eat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Klein sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you haven't touched it, then I can help." Leonard didn't waste food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein doesn't mind at all: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, most of the food in front of him was eaten by Leonard and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the dinner, the waiters brought up a piece of beef pudding and a portion of ice cream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein tasted the latter, only feeling cold and sweet, extraordinarily appetizing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, he finished his own ice cream with blueberry juice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is because of this that he began to feel the hunger of the heart and stomach, which is the desire to supplement the body after a lot of consumption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swallowing swallowed, Klein looked in front of him, only to see the plate was messy, almost no surplus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come here, let us have a drink for Klein at the end." At this time, Dunn proposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice did not fall, Klein blurted out and debuted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, I can come back again Dinner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this request, everyone was silent and then whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, you finally recovered, no problem, you can do two more." Dunn shook his head and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anxious and unbearable waiting, Klein heard the scream of his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the freshly fried piece of black pepper sauce came up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knife and fork flew, and Klein, who almost shed tears, solved the seven-point cooked food in one hour and a half, and had meat in the mouth. Fragrance and juice reverberate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, looking at an empty plate, he sighed with satisfaction, put down the knife and fork, and drank champagne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The waiter, checkout." Dunn turned to the waiter next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter first went to the front desk and then returned with the bill, explaining in detail:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have opened five bottles of Desi Champagne, each bottle of 12 Sule 3 pence, a small cup of South Weir red wine, 10 pence ... each black pepper sauce steak 1 Sule 2 pence ... each beef pudding 6 Penny, 1 ice cream per sore... Total is 5 pounds, 9 sul 6 pennies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 pounds 9 sul 6 pennies? I almost ate my salary for a week! The restaurant is really much more expensive than eating at home! Klein heard a slap in the face, very glad that the captain said that he did not need to treat himself, there is a small vault, there are extra funds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calculated carefully and found that the most expensive part of dinner was the drink, just 5 bottles of champagne and 3 pounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
