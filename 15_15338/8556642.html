			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the recent major events, "Moon" Emlin quickly locked in the outbreak of smog and plague, guessing that the opposite lady is referring to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I heard that it was a "desperate witch" who sought to be promoted... and the storm church quickly responded, creating a hurricane. Everything, how can this be said that Mr. "The Fool" saved Beckland? The news of Emlin, backed by ethnic groups, is fairly well-informed. It is inevitable that both sides are strange and confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has always been proud and unwilling to spend his time on social interactions, he still has instinctive fears when he exists in a hidden existence that can be called "He". I dare not rush to ask, I plan to listen to it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger even received the news of the Bakerland smog incident, even the secrets hidden behind the scenes and the truth behind the scenes. I am very interested, and I am convinced that this is absolutely a battle between the gods. After all, it has attracted the attention of Mr. Fool! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you exchange news, ask Miss "Justice", but she may not be too clear, her position can not understand so many real details, Oh, her curiosity is very heavy. With such a beginning, she will definitely try to get answers from Mr. "fool", hoping to have the opportunity to listen... I think here, Alger looked at the "sun" and saw He is not anxious, calm and restrained, and he knows that he and the exploration team of Silver City have got rid of the cycle of fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, "Justice" Audrey also read the smoothness of their actions from the reaction of the "Sun", quietly relieved, ready to wait and then detail Understand the passing of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the solemn ceremony of Mr. Fool, she thanked the "world" and thanked the Tarot members who did not look like good people in advance. Warning: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Mr. World, if it’s not your advance reminder, perhaps this time in the fog, Beckland will die hundreds of thousands. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, this also saved myself." Klein manipulated the "world" and snorted and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said sincerely, there is no such thing as acting, because if the "Justice" is not notified in advance, the night goddess church is reminded by the other party, the wipe The strong man who lost Mr. A will not arrive in time, and he may not be able to support himself for too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr. A takes it apart, he may not be able to resurrect... Klein thought fortunately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. A’s eating is really eating! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as a "fool", he leaned back on his chair and responded with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I just provided a little help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, your leader really saved Beckland, his contribution is the biggest among all people. "Justice" Audrey praised the heartfeltly, "His reminder to let the goddess prepare the church of the goddess of the night, clear the desperate witch in time, and stop the wake of the 'original witch', let the fog The degree of pollution is within the controllable range, and he also directly ruined the ritual of the Aurora, and once again tried to isolate the 'real creator' from the real world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the most important news, Audrey received the unanimous praise of Earl and Countess, and did not conceal the results of her investigation and some details of the inquiries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, they also raised the hope of being a parent, letting her daughter try not to be too involved with the secret organization, in the outer circle, and get some news. It is enough to maintain the strength below sequence 7. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original witch" wants to wake up... "The real creator" is trying to come... What happened to Beckland? At the same time, "downside down" Alger and "Moon" Emlin had the same reaction, but the expression was different. The former was only slightly lifted on the eyelids, the pupils contracted, and they did not consciously sit a little, but the latter gave The illusion of jumping up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother, no, the moon is on, when did Beckland become so dangerous? There were two evil spirits in a smog! The lady is a lie, right? Although the "fool" is a suspected god, it is impossible to offend two "his" at the same level. Can it be said that he is actually the embodiment of the god? Or is there an alliance between gods behind him? Is this the reason why the ancestors asked me to pray to Him? The more Emlin thinks, the faster the heartbeat can be confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The nickname of the blood race "vampire" does not mean that they have no heartbeat, but it is relatively slow, and the heart itself is one of the Achilles heel of the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough! It’s an event that has attracted the attention of Mr. Fool... But what good can He gain from the plot to destroy the evil spirits? "The hanging man" Alger secretly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Fols is surprised and scared, not thinking of the horrible smog that has taken away tens of thousands of lives is still more scary behind the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not stopped in time, the entire Beckland will be destroyed, and I and Hugh will not survive... Fuls swallowed hard . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her feelings are also Audrey’s thoughts. With this matter, the aristocratic girl really realized that she thought that peace and stability were normal and stable. Life, in the collision between the gods, like soap bubbles, will be broken immediately after a little stimulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, the whole kingdom, the entire human society, is only due to the balance between the gods, and this balance is extremely fragile...every similar ideas Audrey was amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing someone knowing and remembering their contributions, Kleinton was a bit gratified and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, he has to stay away from Beckland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Fool"'s leader temporarily left Beckland? "Justice" Audrey once again got up and made a sincere dedication:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please convey my thanks to him."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein maintains his image, does not respond, just clicks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Audrey added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, because the three churches The military and the military are cleaning up Bakerland. I have not been able to get the follow-up Russell Diary. Please wait another week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Klein said plainly without wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the conversation between the two people, "Magic" Firth woke up and looked forward to the bronze long table:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, I have received three pages of Russell's Diary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the more members The more channels, the more things will fly like snowballs... Klein sighs lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell Diary? "Moon" Emlin feels like he has heard something wrong again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his doubtful eyes, Fols had a three-page diary and passed them on to Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, Klein remembered that he had missed a vampire and introduced it with a chuckle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is a new member, Mr. Moon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This gathering is called Tarot, they are..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. "Moon", I thought that the "Moon" card would be a lady... "Justice" Audrey was polite and eloquent, thinking and distractingly thinking about it. Similarly, Emlin is also speculating about whether members such as "downside down" and "justice" are human beings, or supernatural creatures, in what way. It is equal to the sequence, which organization it belongs to, and whether it is friendly to the blood family.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not care about their mutual consideration, and turned their attention to the diary in their hands:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On February 11th, I learned a secret of the Sauron family today, hahaha, laughing at me! Hahaha! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that the 'hunter' approach they master will be degenerate in sequence 4, the man will not change, the woman will become a man! No wonder I understand the high sequence of the Sauron family. The strong one does not have a woman, 'Iron Blood Knight' is really a real man!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
