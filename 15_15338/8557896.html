			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Kline’s spiritual touch, the ever-expanding and shrinking crimson “Star” reveals the picture and sound it contains:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black-haired lady in a classical robe fell to the floor, wriggling and twisting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She holds a seemingly ordinary astrological instrument in one hand and a short scepter with a small arm in one hand, and the strong will to survive will almost break through the deep red "stars" "The bondage is directly passed into Klein's ear." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like "Justice", "Sun" and others, this lady's figure is rather vague, it is difficult to identify the specific looks, but there are some things, Klein It can still be clearly seen. For example, she has five facial features. For example, the muscles of her cheeks are cracking, and the flesh and blood are condensing, which seems to have turned into eyeballs. For example, her ears stretch out like a horn, for example, her fingers are on the floor. Grabbing a trace of vivid blood, for example, there is a pair of cold and ruthless, almost opaque, almost transparent eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The variation of the black-haired woman has not been serious, her body is self-repairing, making the eye-like flesh and blood, let the cracked muscles Condensed, letting the outstretched ears retract... Each detail is in a state of repeated sawing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pair of illusory transparent eyes without eyelashes let Klein squint, seemingly back to Tingen, back to the first time to master the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw such a pair of eyes behind the old Neil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hidden Sage"? Klein leaned back against the back of the chair and stretched his hand, holding the "Poseidon Scepter" who once again flew out of the debris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intends to do a favor and give the two evil eyes a few lightnings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But carefully discerning, he is keenly aware that the abnormality of a brunette woman comes from a crazy slang that no one else can hear, because the source of everything is in the ear, in the spirit Deep, in the spirit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation with Miss "Magician" when she suffered a full moon slang is very similar... Fortunately, I am an experienced person, otherwise I will make a wrong response. ... Klein's thoughts have turned, there is a way to save people, that is, to pull the other's spirit into the fog, directly shield the crazy slang, as long as there is no source of power, the mutation will soon be The self-repairing instinct of the lady's body is solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether the other party is not worthy of help, whether it is a matter of want or not, now he is no longer as troubled as in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the black-haired lady is very sinful, in the case that she has already established a connection with the deep red "star" and the mysterious space above the fog, Klein was ready to give her a few lightnings and let her go where she should go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the meaning, or what kind of accident, I have the "Poseidon Scepter", "Black Emperor" card, and can initially shake the fog power There is no power to counter it... Klein holds the white bone scepter in his right hand and points to the corresponding "star". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spirituality rushes into the deep red glow of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he has established a mysterious and solid connection more easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of Ms. Brunette is instantly displayed on the side of the bronze long table, sitting on a chair that does not belong to the current members of the Tarot Club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Klein showed the final picture of the other side through the crimson "Stars", the variation of the other body has been significantly weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t see the dagger, patiently waiting for the other person to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Brunette is still a bit embarrassed, the first second is still struggling in the ultimate pain, the eyes gradually black, and the next second has come to a towering raft Inside the palace, there is a quiet fog that can't be seen at the end, how to keep her from staying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief silence, she looked at the top of the mottled long table, and asked in a whirlwind tone:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the underworld?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not dead." Klein laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw the black-backed chair of the black-haired lady, and the symbol of the starry light moved quickly, forming a pair of eyes with countless stars, cold and indifferent, without eyelashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to past experience, he believes that this is the symbol that represents the "sneak peek" approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Brunette is stunned and gradually finds her reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She instinctively quietly looked around and finally turned her eyes to the mysterious man shrouded in fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White shirt, swallowtail dress, untie bow tie, black pants, bright leather boots, black hair, blurred appearance, this is no strange place... he The hand is very casually holding the milky white scepter whose root is slightly longer than the arm. The scepter... The blackhead's pupil shrinks, and the blue sapphire is reflected in the depths of the scorpion and it almost stirs around. The sea and the storm breath, in addition, the hard-to-find light spots around it naturally give a sense of sacred majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a semi-god scepter! In his hand is like a toy... He doesn't care about it at all... The brunette lady is slightly blinking and cautiously asks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do? Calling you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You can call me Mr. Fool’s.” Klein answered skillfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foolish...The black-haired lady chewed the word and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I heard about your name from Mr. Z of the 'Aurora Club'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is waiting to admit or deny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Z who knows the 'Aurora Club'... This is an old friend... Klein smiled and did not answer, but said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not going to introduce yourself?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This should be the most basic etiquette. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Brunette remembers what she has just happened and silences again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few seconds, her voice whispered a little deep: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Jia De Li Ya, and there is a nickname of 'Star above.' <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool's, have you saved me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "?" One of the seven pirate generals, "the star will be", a reward of 37,000 pounds of "star above"? I saved a treasure, no, a person with a low status... Klein is half-sweet and slightly changed the sitting position. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; He chuckled replied: "? the fact that it is not very clear" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;; & nbsp <br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the star above" Jia De Li Ya immediately got up: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your help, what are you doing? If you need me to do it, you can directly command it, as long as it is within my ability and does not violate my principles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s going to be a good person...very sophisticated Experienced... It’s a “star above” that has been known for many years... Klein’s inexplicable feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His members of the Tarot Club, in addition to the "downside down" and their own incarnation "the world", were quite young when they first participated:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missing "Justice" is a kind of faintly understanding of the mysterious world, but it has not really entered. The "sun" is "educated by education", but the environment is occluded, and the age is younger. Small, very honest, although the "Magician" has been an extraordinary person for several years, but has been stuck in the sequence 9, in the wild state, not much understanding of the various hidden parties, experience is not counted Foot, "Moon" Emlin is born in an extraordinary race, backed by a profound force, but because he does not love to go out, like to play at home, very inexperienced in some aspects, it is easy to be cheated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin, guy, smart is smart, but that is, hehe, if he meets Terry, no, Terry Chik, this witch, can Being cheated by the other party to sell the doll... Klein teased the vampire who can count as a friend in the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the "star above" and did not directly respond to the question of how to repay the help of life. He smiled and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a member of the Morse Absinthe ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Jia Delia did not feel that this thing can survive the "Foolish Man". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you just do, it provoked that Guy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not sure that the eyes before belong to the "hidden sage", so replace it with a vague "that guy", so that no matter How, "Mr. Fool" is absolutely correct and personal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Delia was silent: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I didn't provoke him." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused and continued:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moss members of the martyrdom believe Everything is all, chasing the knowledge itself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Russell once said that we are not chasing knowledge, but knowledge is chasing us, 'hidden The sage' is the knowledge itself. He is chasing us and chasing every member of the Morse sorrow. When a lot of knowledge is poured in, but it cannot be digested and mastered quickly, the situation just happened, or the mind is released. The defense line, accepting the transformation of the 'hidden sage', is supported by perseverance. If it can't hold it, it will get out of control. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, it is not specifically targeted by the "hidden sage", even if you succeed in getting rid of the predicament, you will not be suspected... according to you In that case, you have mastered a lot of knowledge... At the beginning, Daniel just wanted to get the knowledge of human body refining and perfect resurrection... Klein was awkward but not showing his face.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "the star above the wind" is not bad, it belongs to the kind of thieves... Klein converged thoughts, calmly said:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After encountering similar things, you can miss my name. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missing your name...Gailelia's lips moved a few times, and the instinct wanted to refuse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't speak for a moment, and she was silent for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After repeated discretion, she stood up, arms crossed on her chest, slightly squatting A shout: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can I do for you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein laughed and said with a less careful tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The future My leader provides some help. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow your wishes. "Jia De Li Ya sat down again and asked carefully, "Is the name given by Mr. Z belongs to you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rehearsed the name of the "fool".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gently Nod, it’s right.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gardella looked at the other seats that were empty, and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, is there anyone else here? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some people like you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They established a fixed party, I am a witness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘉德丽雅Silence for a full dozen seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I participate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thinks Since it is related to the mysterious existence of "fool", it is better to do more understanding than to do nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, you have money, knowledge, power, and demand... Klein leans back against the chair:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
