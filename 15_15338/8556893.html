			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending a telegram and packing the table, the "White Shark" Hamilton relaxed completely and had the mood and ability to think about the details of the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first problem that jumped into his mind was:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the outside guard?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up with his hands, suddenly stood up, walked heavily to the door, opened a squat, and found several men standing there slantingly , telling jokes about women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamilton first angered, and immediately calmed down, his face muscles slightly slammed down the open door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several guards were shocked, instinctively turning their heads and looking to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing who made the sound, they hurriedly stood and snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Shark" silently took a breath: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just saw who entered me "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Lardro, said there is a situation downstairs." The guards were very confused about this problem, "The boss let him in." The..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, they suddenly thought of other explanations, and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Head (boss), there are items stolen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamilton sinks and shakes his head:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be distracted!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! He retracted his body, closed the door, left a few guards there, and you looked at me and I saw you, suspecting that the head was drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, the tall, fat Hamilton frowned and took a step back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Lardro, Lardro, they saw Lardro... that guy, that guy, can change into the look of others "As a collaborator who helps pirates sell and collect intelligence, "White Shark" Hamilton is no stranger to all kinds of rumors on the sea. The first thing that comes to mind is that it can be turned into any former pirate general, Kiringes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he soon thought of more:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily this magic Ability, if it is really close to the description in the rumor, illusion, suggestion, spiritual manipulation, can do something similar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, there is a The place feels not right. The guy who just looked like Sven, mad inside, horrible, how to sneak in, pretend to be my subordinate, and called a 'boss', with his character, he should stun or kill Everyone who saw along the way walked to the door like a walk and then knocked the door very politely! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't make a big move, don't leave too much information, and don't expose the secrets of your own sequence, then you can use more hidden." Ways, such as climbing windows...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "very contradictory... There is only one explanation for this contradiction, he is pretending! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you disguise your personality, or do you pretend to be powerful? Or, both may have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking Here, Hamilton suddenly stopped and put all the details together:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guy is a newbie! His madness is disguised! His power is dependent on a certain A magical item is shown!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it must be! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The only way to explain those contradictions is that he does not climb the outer wall and enters from the window because his own sequence is low and he is not good at it." Things, the focus of magical items is not in this field... In order to enter the room smoothly, he is willing to lower his head and call my boss because he relies purely on magical items, he does not have much confidence in himself, is not proud and crazy... he acts like A madman is to cooperate with magical items to create fear, create pressure, and ask for news.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can also explain perfectly why he left like that. The reason why he found me is because he got a powerful magical item, his ambitions are expanding, he wants to make money by arresting and hunting some pirates, and so on. I was in the service of the 'Golden Cod Snake' Odell and the 'Blood of the Blood', and may be involved in the 'Mysterious Queen'. I was afraid, feared, and chose to leave when I was a little perfunctory. "Dare to kill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Shark" Hamilton wants to think that he has found the truth, busy re-sending the radio, flipping the code book, and reissuing a Intelligence, a brief description of his own guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks that he has not been targeted by the hunter. The previous thing is purely due to the ambition of a young man who has an adventure, and he gives the target Corresponding features: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Blonde blue eyes, not crazy, even timid.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Having a very magical item, perhaps changing the looks and body, may create hallucinations, combined with terror, the latter is more likely, in short, no way to know what he really is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a novice with no experience, good at using objects to pretend to be powerful!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I have some understanding, not the first time I came to the port of Damir. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒,哒,哒, Hamilton stopped his fingers and sat back with satisfaction, pressing the chair to squeak.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of his mouth is a little raised, it seems that he has seen the ending of the bastard:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A sequence is very low, but has The guy with powerful magical items will not have any good endings at sea, and the more greedy sharks flock to him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At that time, there is no need to worry that my problem will be revealed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... .........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The port under the night is quite quiet, leaving Klein, the "flying fish and wine", to go far, fast and slow, and gradually enter the walk . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that no one was tracking, he changed his face back to German Sparrow when he passed through the dark area, and put the shirt hem into it. In the pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lower corner, and Klein took out the gold-rimmed glasses and placed it on the bridge of the nose, and the appearance of Sven was a little cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to rely on the stars to identify the direction and return to the position where the White Onyx docked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking around, he laughed softly, in the cold wind, dreaming:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I hope that the white shark is not so stupid, can see the flaws that I left behind..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did for the "visitors" tonight The person is a new adventurer who has little experience and will make mistakes. This person has a good understanding of Dam Harbour and the “White Shark”. He has a coveted magical item and is powered by powerful forces. Dizzy in my head, my heart seems a little crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s original idea was that pirates roamed the ocean, and even the Navy could hardly find them if they could get more from the White Shark. The exact information, of course, can be directly on-site service, if not, then use this identity as a bait, attract some pirates who know the goods to the intended location, complete the initial hunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discovering that the "White Shark" can contact the "Veteran of the Blood" intelligence officer, Old Quin, Klein’s plan is improved, that is, The content of the password and the spectrum band, monitor the corresponding situation, grasp the movement of the target, and interfere with divination, and then use the combination of powerful magical items and weak adventurers as bait to catch a few big fish at the most appropriate time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The problem now is that I don't have a device for monitoring... I can't buy it at sea... I can't be 'world', please 'justice' Or Miss 'Magician' helped buy a set at Beckland and 'delivered' with a sacrifice... This is the advantage of the Tarot Club!" Klein felt a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the White Onyx in sight, he stepped up slightly and found that the Donna family and Krivis and others returned from another street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crevis greeted him in a dagger, and when he met formally, he whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that there are people in the 'flying fish and wine' there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message is very well-informed, quite familiar with the port of Damir... Klein outlines the mouth, dull Answer: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just taught the two swindlers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crives brows I suddenly felt that I had some mistakes in the judgment of German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the previous observations and getting along, he thought that this young adventurer was sharp, a little restrained, cold, but still a smile He is polite and knows how to advance and retreat. Now, he is somewhat uncertain, and he only feels deep inside, and may have a crazy flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Donna’s father interjected: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;” Mr. Krivis "This is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A peer, German Sparrow." Krivis introduced it very simply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiles politely and extends the right palm:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am honored to meet you, if later You need to hire people, but you can't find them. Think about me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, I hope you are as strong and professional as they are!" Donna’s father shook hands with Klein enthusiastically and introduced himself, “Uldi Blanche.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just returned Retreating, the inspiration was struck, and there was a slight anomaly in the gift box that the servants of Blanche had. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quietly opened his mind and found that the gift box contained a strip of cured meat, but the surface of the cured meat was red, white and black. It’s very dark, it’s like something from the spiritual world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a spirit of the spirit, but it is basically harmless... This bacon is very strange... Klein has a strange heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noticing his gaze, Donna’s father smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a specialty of Port Damir. There is an extinct volcano in the center of the island. There are gaps in several surrounding caves. There is a natural hot air blowing, where the cured meat is served, and you can get a wonderful and unique flavor. Gift, give it to a friend.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Sparo, if you want to buy something, you still have time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unique flavor? The taste of the spirit? Klein has a general understanding of what is going on.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp According to the theory of occultism, the spiritual world is completely overlapping with reality but does not interfere with each other. It must rely on extraordinary power to break the interval. However, this situation is not absolute. There are some spiritual circles in the world that are too strong and affect the reality. The place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an area, the deceased can easily become a ghost, a zombie, etc., and there are also many possible spiritual events in the house.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be a similar situation inside the cave of Damir Harbour, but it is not serious, it does not cause anomalies, but the bacon is dyed with a unique flavor... Things don't eat a lot at once, no problem... Kline smiles and responds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no interest in cured meat. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this moment, he confirmed that the cured meat given by the previous bartender was of a common breed, not a special one.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; At this moment, the little boy Denton pointed to the moon in the air:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good red! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well! Donna nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good red? Klein looked up and saw that the red moon tonight was no different from usual.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the child’s spirit is purer, after eating this bacon, it has a short-lived, certain vision ability after being exposed to the spirit of the spirit? Will the children on this island be Is there a similar situation? Oh, this may be the source of folklore in Port Damir... Klein looked at it and found the answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
