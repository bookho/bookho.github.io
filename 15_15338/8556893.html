			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending a telegram and packing the table, the "White Shark" Hamilton relaxed completely and had the mood and ability to think about the details of the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first problem that jumped into his mind was:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the outside guard?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up with his hands, suddenly stood up, walked heavily to the door, opened a squat, and found several men standing there slantingly , telling jokes about women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamilton first angered, and immediately calmed down, his face muscles slightly slammed down the open door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several guards were shocked, instinctively turning their heads and looking to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing who made the sound, they hurriedly stood and snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Shark" silently took a breath: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just saw who entered me "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Lardro, said there is a situation downstairs." The guards were very confused about this problem, "The boss let him in." The..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, they suddenly thought of other explanations, and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Head (boss), there are items stolen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamilton sinks and shakes his head:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be distracted!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! He retracted his body, closed the door, left a few guards there, and you looked at me and I saw you, suspecting that the head was drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, the tall, fat Hamilton frowned and took a step back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Lardro, Lardro, they saw Lardro... that guy, that guy, can change into the look of others "As a collaborator who helps pirates sell and collect intelligence, "White Shark" Hamilton is no stranger to all kinds of rumors on the sea. The first thing that comes to mind is that it can be turned into any former pirate general, Kiringes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he soon thought of more:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily this magic Ability, if it is really close to the description in the rumor, illusion, suggestion, spiritual manipulation, can do something similar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, there is a The place feels not right. The guy who just looked like Sven, mad inside, horrible, how to sneak in, pretend to be my subordinate, and called a 'boss', with his character, he should stun or kill Everyone who saw along the way walked to the door like a walk and then knocked the door very politely! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't make a big move, don't leave too much information, and don't expose the secrets of your own sequence, then you can use more hidden." Ways, such as climbing windows...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "very contradictory... There is only one explanation for this contradiction, he is pretending! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you disguise your personality, or do you pretend to be powerful? Or, both may have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking Here, Hamilton suddenly stopped and put all the details together:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guy is a newbie! His madness is disguised! His power is dependent on a certain A magical item is shown!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only way to explain those contradictions is that he does not climb the outer wall and enters from the window because his own sequence is low and he is not good at it. The focus of magical items is not in this field... he wants to enter smoothly. The room, willing to lower his head, call my boss, because purely relying on magical items, not much confidence in itself, not arrogant and crazy... He acts like a madman, in order to match the magical items to create fear, make Stress, ask for a message.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This also explains perfectly why he left like that. He found me because he got a piece. Powerful magical items, ambitions, want to make money by arresting and hunting some pirates, etc., I know that I am serving the intelligence officer Lao Quin for the 'Silver Coin Odyssey' and 'Blood', and may involve ' After the mysterious queen, I was scared, afraid, and chose to leave when I was a little perfunctory, not afraid to kill! "<白 /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Shark" Hamilton wants to think that he has found the truth, busy re-establishing the radio, flipping the code book, and reissuing an intelligence message. My own guess is described briefly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks that he has not been eye-catching by the hunter. The previous thing is purely due to the ambition of an young man who has an adventure. And for the goal, he also gave the corresponding characteristics: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Blonde blue eyes, not crazy, even a little timid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Having a pretty magical item, perhaps changing the looks and body, may create hallucinations, combined with terror, the latter is more likely, in short, I don't know what he really looks like.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a novice with no experience, good at using things to pretend to be powerful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a certain understanding of me, not the first time I came to the port of Damir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒,哒,哒, Hamilton stopped his fingers and sat back with satisfaction, pressing the chair to creak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of his mouth is a little raised, it seems that he has seen the ending of the bastard:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" A guy with a very low sequence but a powerful magical item will not have any good endings at sea. Most of the greedy sharks are coming to him!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you don't have to worry about my problems will be exposed! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The port under the night is quite quiet, leaving "flying fish and wine Klein turned around, fast and slow, and gradually walked into the walk.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that no one was tracking, he would pass through the dark area The face turned back to Gilman Sparo, and the shirt hem was put into the pants.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lower corner, Klein pulled out the gold-rimmed glasses, the frame On the bridge of the nose, the appearance of Sven is a little cold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to rely on the stars to identify the direction and return to the position where the White Onyx docked.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking around, he laughed softly, in the cold wind, and thought:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hope" The white shark 'is not so stupid, can see the flaws that I left behind..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His experience for the "visitors" tonight is experience Not many, new adventurers who make mistakes, and this People know a lot about Damir Port and the "White Shark", with a mouth-watering magical item, which is stunned by powerful power, and the heart is a bit crazy.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s original idea was that pirates roamed the ocean, and even the Navy could hardly find them. If you could get more accurate information from the White Shark, you can of course come directly to the service. If it doesn't work, use this identity as a bait to attract some pirates who know the goods to the intended location to complete the initial hunting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being able to contact the old "Queen of Blood" intelligence officer, Klein's plan is perfected, that is, to obtain the password content and spectrum band, monitor the corresponding situation, grasp the target's movements, and interfere with divination, and then The most appropriate time, using a combination of powerful magical items and weak adventurers as bait to catch a few big fish.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the white agate was in sight, he stepped up slightly and found that the Donna family and Krivis and others returned from another street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crevis greeted him in a dagger, and when he met formally, he whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that there are people in the 'flying fish and wine' there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message is very well-informed, quite familiar with Damir Port... Ryan outlined the corner of his mouth and replied plainly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just taught the two swindlers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Reeves frowned, suddenly felt that he had some mistakes in the judgment of German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the previous observations and getting along, he thought that this young adventurer was sharp, a little restrained, cold, but still a smile He is polite and knows how to advance and retreat. Now, he is somewhat uncertain, and he only feels deep inside, and may have a crazy flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Donna’s father interjected: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;” Mr. Krivis "This is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A peer, German Sparrow." Krivis introduced it very simply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiles politely and extends the right palm:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am honored to meet you, if later You need to hire people, but you can't find them. Think about me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, I hope you are as strong and professional as they are!" Donna’s father shook hands with Klein enthusiastically and introduced himself, “Uldi Blanche.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just returned Retreating, the inspiration was struck, and there was a slight anomaly in the gift box that the servants of Blanche had. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quietly opened his mind and found that the gift box contained a strip of cured meat, but the surface of the cured meat was red, white and black. It’s very dark, it’s like something from the spiritual world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a spirit of the spirit, but it is basically harmless... This bacon is very strange... Klein has a strange heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noticing his gaze, Donna’s father smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a specialty of Port Damir. There is an extinct volcano in the center of the island. There are gaps in several surrounding caves. There is a natural hot air blowing, where the cured meat is served, and you can get a wonderful and unique flavor. Gift, give it to a friend.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Sparo, if you want to buy something, you still have time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unique flavor? The taste of the spirit? Klein has a general understanding of what is going on.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp According to the theory of occultism, the spiritual world is completely overlapping with reality but does not interfere with each other. It must rely on extraordinary power to break the interval. However, this situation is not absolute. There are some spiritual circles in the world that are too strong and affect the reality. The place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an area, the deceased can easily become a ghost, a zombie, etc., and there are also many possible spiritual events in the house.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be a similar situation inside the cave of Damir Harbour, but it is not serious, it does not cause anomalies, but the bacon is dyed with a unique flavor... Things don't eat a lot at once, no problem... Kline smiles and responds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no interest in cured meat. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this moment, he confirmed that the cured meat given by the previous bartender was of a common breed, not a special one.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; At this moment, the little boy Denton pointed to the moon in the air:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good red! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
