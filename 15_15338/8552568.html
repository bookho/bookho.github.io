One of the men who rushed into the carriage, looked at the flight attendant in disgust Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein uses the corner of his eye to sight the other side's skinny and fine, the skin color is like the long-term exposure to the sun, the eye socket is more depressed than the normal Lun Kingdom people. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highlanders? Or mixed? He looked down thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the Northern Continent, at the beginning of the Hornaces Mountains, it is a dry plateau, most of which belongs to the Kingdom of Fenetport, which is attributed to the West. The Republic of Tis, close to the east, is occupied by the Kingdom of Lun. The aborigines are barbaric but brave and brave. For a long time in the past, they are one of the most troublesome problems in the three countries, but with the improvement of gunpowder weapons, the form of war The changes, these plateau people finally recognized the reality and completely yielded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large part of them left the plateau, entered Beckland, entered Trier, entered Fenetport, and entered the bustling cities and ports of the North Continent Some do the workers, others become the fresh blood of the local gangsters, dare to fight and dare to kill, not afraid of things big. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Crew is a twenty-year-old man, heard shrink the shrink body, pointing to the direction of third-class carriage road: <br /> <br /> & nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw...he went there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first person wearing a black jacket and a half-high hat nodded invisibly. Leading several accomplices, rushing to the third-class car, did not care about the eyes of the surrounding passengers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were the boy, I must have got off the third class at this time... Klein thought about the newspaper as he thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than a minute, the whistle of "呜" sounded and the door of the carriage slowly closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the jingle, the steam subway started to run from slow to fast, but at this time, Klein suddenly touched and looked up to the other second-class The door of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the fifteen-year-old boy wearing an old coat, wearing a dome hat and carrying an old satchel slowly walked into the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face is green, the facial features are delicate, and the bright red eyes are calm and serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;".........Great, this is the car that got off the third-class car, and it’s in the first-class position around the circle? I’m afraid the chaser will have Colleagues are waiting in the subway station?” Klein was a little surprised. He only felt that the way the big boy handled things was quite mature and cautious, much stronger than many people in their twenties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flicking the left tooth, he quietly turned on the vision, swept the big boy and saw that his body was in a state of exhaustion, his mood was tight, but still Maintain a blue of calm thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not simple... From the age point... Klein silently sighed and continued to look down at his own newspaper. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; the big boys are not aware that they have extraordinary person look at it again, again to the third class to go, <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next journey was calm and calm, and Klein arrived in one of the three subway stations in the Jowood area after more than 20 minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat for another ten minutes in the rental carriage, finally found Minsk Street, according to the description of the newspaper, came to the 17th next door, No. 15, pull The doorbell rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;布谷! Cloth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the reverberation of the ringtones in the house, there is a mechanical bird on the door that is not a good-looking figure. It has to be slap-sized and consists of gears and other parts. Constantly nodded and sounded like a cuckoo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very good toy, is a rough workmanship... Klein pertinently commented. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; After ten seconds, the dark door was opened, a maid wearing a black and white dress young woman looked quite alert Klein Road: <br / > <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "I ask you something?" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Klein smile Young cane wrapped in newspaper under Rod's道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came to Mrs. Summer to rent a house. Should I have not rented it yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full name given in the newspaper is Starling. Summer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. Wait a moment." The maid bent down politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rushed in, informed the hostess, after a while, came out again, led Klein into the house, and helped him put his hand and suitcase In the foyer, hang the coat and top hat on the coat rack in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm air wave rushed in, and dispelled the coldness that Klein brought in. His eyes swept, and he first saw the unique fireplace and saw the inside. The piece of red, saw the burning smokeless charcoal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living room of the Summerer House is quite large, almost equal to the entire floor of the Moretti House, and some places are decorated with decorative carpets and hanging landscapes. painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid came to the sofa area with Klein, and said to the hostess wearing a pale yellow dress:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs., the guest is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hostess is about 30 years old, blonde blue eyes, beautiful appearance, well-maintained, hands Holding a palace feather fan with silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was in her own home, because the fireplace created a warm environment, she did not wear high-necked clothing, the chest was white and greasy, and the neck was long and smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mrs. Summer." Klein pressed his chest and took a ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Summerr laughs and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, please sit, you want to drink Coffee, or black tea?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat down on the couch and replied calmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Black tea, thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Julian, Marquis black tea." Mrs. Summer said to the maid, and her eyes turned slightly. "What should I call?" You?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock. Moriarty, you can call me Sherlock directly." Klein had long thought of a pseudonym. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he smelled the smell from the kitchen location and saw the complicated pipes there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, this is my husband’s design, although his job is the manager of the Coim company, but the amateur is a mechanical enthusiast, but also Member of the Kingdom Coal Tobacco Emission Reduction Association.” Mrs. Summer noted Klein’s gaze, smiled and explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. I don’t have to introduce this in detail, I’m not coming to kiss you with your husband... Klein spit, and his face smiles without a smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. I want to rent the house on the 15th."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuel's waist The back is straight and sits in a beautiful position: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I have to remind you in advance that there is no such pipe in the house on the 15th. There is no such comfort. Chair, no table, no sideboard with mahogany base, no good ceramic plates, no silver cutlery, no gold plated tea set, no detachable carpet..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pointed to the things in her house and did the same introduction. At the end, she added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It originally belonged to me My sister and brother-in-law, but my brother-in-law’s business failed. I can only move to the South China. They have a plantation in Bailang, but I don’t agree with their choice. This is for me. Poor nephews and nieces are not fair, there are no good grammar schools, not even good tutors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. This is not what I want to know. Klein nodded in earnest: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to the weather, there is no place in the Southland that compares Beckland."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His addition makes Mrs. Summerr very satisfied, and his eyes are light: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The house has a three-year lease. I hope that you can pay a one-year rent for one year, 18 sule per week, and 1 sule for furniture. I can only charge a little deposit for a total of 50 pounds."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shook his head and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Summer, you should see that I just arrived Beckland, I don't know what will happen next. Paying £50 at a time will reduce my ability to withstand risks. My limit is half a year, £25.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also intends to rent another room in the East Bakerland area for changing clothes, camouflage, and getting rid of tracking - this is an essential preparation for the things he intends to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starling Summerr gently daggers and asks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Have you read the grammar school?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein chuckles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I later learned the history myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have proof of identity?" Stalin asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I was too rushed from home, forgot to bring it, huh, I just forgot to introduce, I am from Kamihain." Klein deliberately used the classmates. Welch's usual accent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just said the word "forget", he remembered Captain Dunn Smith, the smile on his face became more and more brilliant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the maid Julian came over with a cup of black tea, the porcelain enamel was white, the pattern was classical, and some places were plated with gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a sip, only to feel the fragrance is far, sweet and sour, obviously much better than the Xibo black tea he used to drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very pure Marquis black tea." He praised the description with a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stallin. Mrs. Summer's mouth is slightly squinted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half a year, 25 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thanked him for chatting for a few minutes until another maid rummaged through the study. come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were their respective names, and Klein painfully counted 25 pounds of cash and pushed it to Mrs. Summer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starlin spreads the silence and immediately slams his chin:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Ryati, are you looking for a job in Beckland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Klein replied a little blankly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stalene’s mouth is slightly stalked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I can give you some advice, week The salary is less than 3 pounds. It is very difficult to live in the Jowood area. Your rent, food expenses, tap water gas charcoal costs, transportation expenses, etc. add up to at least 2 pounds 5 Sule, believe me, this is Beckland, The rest will have to consider new clothes and good tableware tea sets... The weekly salary of 3 pounds is a very stubborn bottom line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the weekly salary can To reach 5 pounds, you can hire a maid, 6 pounds to consider hiring a chef, 7 pounds plus a male attendant, 8 pounds to hire another maid..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Summer, I think you are showing off... I used to pay 10 pounds a week... Klein kept a smile and listened carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door suddenly opened, and a burly man came in. He wore a black double-breasted long dress and the same color leather gloves. There are two beautiful mustaches on the lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luke, this is Mr. Moriarty, he is now our neighbor." Starling Summerer greeted him and introduced Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obvious that the male master’s Luke took off his coat and handed it to the men’s servant behind him, and politely smiled:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moriarty, willing to accept dinner invitations?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
