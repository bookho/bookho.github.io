			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has opened the door in the depths of the mural hall and came out? The out of control or extraordinary creatures in the vicinity? And he also has the ability to act in a dream? After listening to Anderson Hood’s remarks, Klein logically made speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thoughts turned around, he suddenly had a new idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it be Before looking at the deck, look at the owner of mysterious eyes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is possible! If the mysterious man has been lurking on the ship and following the sea, he will certainly fall asleep in the dark, appearing in the dream world... Ms. "The Hidden" is completely unaware of his existence, or acquiesced. His actions? This is her dare to take over the cards that I am not afraid of being afraid of this place? No, this is not certain, at least not sure that the one who opened the door in the mural hall is the mysterious man on the boat... Klein looked at Anderson deeply, and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Why don't you feel like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Anderson Hood mentioned that he originally suspected that the door opener was a member of the "Future" and later felt Not quite like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson laughed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just visited everyone on the ship in a dream And found that they do not have the ability to move freely in that world, except you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately I was pushing the door outside." Klein said calmly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson shrugged his shoulders:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, so I didn't doubt you, this The ocean is full of dangers, and there are all kinds of unimaginable monsters. Maybe the guy who opened the door is the former stone giant, or a rotten dragon that dreams of countless treasures."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he leaned on the ship's side and looked out at the ocean covered with golden sunlight. He smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found me from the storm After the escape from the shipwreck crisis, the bad luck was eliminated a little bit, haha, obviously, it is not fixed, permanent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, I am successful I swam to the island, but after all the bad luck, at least it was up to you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I quoted the monster and let the stone giant appear, but we solved it easily, isn't it?<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, I have been on board for a few hours, nothing happened, this doesn't mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson The voice has not fallen, and Klein has interrupted him ruthlessly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy doesn't know if he is black and he talks less? I want to beat him! If you didn't divination before the fog, you didn't change, you didn't get I am going to sink you into the sea, um... The sequence 8 of the "hunter" route is "provocative", he must have digested the potion very easily... Klein sincerely I think that Anderson is much better than Daniz in the "provocation" aspect.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, good, I shut up, shut up. Anderson lifted his hands and smiled a little at no worries.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that he didn’t provide clues to the openers in the dream world, Klein was silent for a few seconds. Suddenly turned and walked into the cabin.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found himself negligent in one thing!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Since Anderson, who was overshadowed by bad luck, got on the boat, it means that the possibility of a dangerous attack will increase dramatically, so it is necessary to make some preparations!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to the room, Klein took out the Azick copper whistle and Will. Anthony paper crane, entered the bathroom, arranged his own ritual to summon himself, and then put "fire" gloves, sun brooch and " The extraordinary characteristics of the Nightmare brought from the fog to the real world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not immediately replace the items that he carried with him, but put them in the suitcase and put them Beside the biotoxin bottle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, even if the danger is sudden, he has the opportunity to adjust the "equipment" in time to make a targeted selection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, Klein relaxed a lot, packed up the rest of the items, left the room, went to the deck, afraid to miss the mermaid's clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just walked out of the cabin and saw Frank Lee next to him, his expression shocked and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" Klein groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was afraid that the experiment of this crazy "hybridist" had gone wrong, causing the "Future" to fall into a terrible ecological disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank swayed and shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did I tell you about those little things?< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They originally needed to sleep for a while before they could grow and reproduce, and the result..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What is the result? "Klein's face has become dignified.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the pirates on the deck and the pirates boast of how many pirates they have hunted but have not noticed that the eyes of the surrounding audience have occurred. Anderson, the "strongest hunter" of change, noticed, curiously stopped telling, and came closer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franking Frank looked up and said:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They just completed a large-scale breeding and changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, this is a miracle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then? Where did they go? Is it still in your 'laboratory'?” Klein intuitively thought it was not a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank digested the problem in two seconds, rolled up his sleeves and exposed his thick arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked on the deck in front of him, revealing a puzzled smile<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They got into the Here, it seems that there is a transformation of the 'future number'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dull percussion, a milky white fountain with suspected milk suddenly emerged from the deck. , splashed Frank Lee full of faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked the liquid in his mouth and surprised the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Future ', 'Future' produces milk!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the pirates on the edge of the ship’s side are horrified at the guns below:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Muzzle, muzzle spit milk!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...this is unscientific...Klein almost controls Can not stop the twitching of the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since boarding the "Future", since the ship came to the fracture and began to fall, he felt that many things that happened were extremely unscientific and even exceeded His range of occult knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson was stunned and even forgot to ask questions, and habitually crippled and successfully saw another milk fountain rushing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thought flashed quickly in Klein’s mind, which made him keenly grasp a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately looked at Frank Lee, and asked in a deep voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your little things After they have infected the 'Future', will they continue to infect people on board?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as the question, Klein’s right palm has been tapped into the pocket. According to the shape, the "floating spell" was selected, ready to fly to the air, away from the infection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank seriously thought:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In theory, it will..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s not falling, a figure smashed out and kicked his ass, kicking him and turning a few more, hitting a beach and A pool of milk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winner is Nina wearing a linen shirt and a dark blue jacket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She roared on the deck of Frank Lee, breathing in a hurry:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I still can't solve your damn little things!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think my chest is not big enough? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, okay. Frank Lee patted his buttocks and said, "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Klein has drawn a spell and whispered:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Storm! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks that he can't underestimate Frank Lee's ability to do things, and suspects that the other party may expand the disaster next time, so fly to the air first. The blue-violet flame envelops the spell made of white tin, and the wind is instantaneous, coiled around Klein's sole and holding him off the deck. Fly to a height of four or five meters.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson first glimpsed and immediately found the palm of his hand, trying to catch Klein, but he slowed down, failed Success, can only watch as Greman Sparrow rises and stays where he is.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ordinary handsome hunter has a distorted expression Shaking his head, he wants to laugh and wants to dismember the opposite "Future" Mr. Daji into eight pieces.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Frank has taken out a bottle of dark green The powder, grabbed a hand, and sang the giant mantra while sprinkling them around.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powder just touched the deck, Breeding green vines, the vines grow wildly, and quickly pick up the milk to pick up the "small things" and wrap the entire deck around the cabin.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Just ten seconds, the "Future" became a vine forest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call, solved. Frank first smiled at Nina, and suddenly his face mutated. "They, they have changed!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a pirate swayed over and shouted in amazement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I, I have a watermelon on my head! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the sound and saw that the pirate’s head had a green-green vine, and one of the knots seemed to have matured. Watermelon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the so-called change? This is simply crazy, damn crazy! Anderson sighed and sighed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately turned his eyes and shouted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There is a problem with the ocean nearby! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-empty Klein also made the same judgment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no external factors Interference, Frank Lee's experimental products and extraordinary abilities will not change at the same time!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zla!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A vine has been torn, and the window of the captain's room has been opened.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The star above will appear", and Jade will appear there and be enlarged with witchcraft. The voice of the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frank, stop all attempts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There may be the atmosphere of the Mother Earth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mother Earth? Klein looked at Ms. "The Hidden" and felt that her previous speculation about this sea area might have to be overthrown! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, kind mother." Frank crossed his hands and made a baby-bearing posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he squatted and kissed the vines devoutly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the star above" Jia Delia stunned at this scene, lingering in the sky, and letting the whole "future" follow Shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
