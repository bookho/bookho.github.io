			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A extraordinary person is allowed to leave the fleet? Without Daniel's special instructions, Klein easily understood why he felt strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night squad, even pure civilian personnel will be subject to strict restrictions. Normal resignation will sign a lifetime confidentiality agreement, and may not be approved to leave the original night. After the squad jurisdiction has been approved to move to another city, it is necessary to find the local night church registration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this regulation, we can see the attitude of the official in dealing with extraordinary power and related things. An extraordinary person who has been drinking a potion cannot be so easy. Get out of the organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein clearly remembers that Miss Justice has the earliest clear channels and methods to become extraordinary, but is unwilling to try. The reason given is that they do not want to lose their freedom. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar idea has made a turn in his mind, but it has not been translated into words, because the courtesy but the cold, Gelman Sparrow is not going to Kind of rumors of interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about that?" Klein looked at the tableware on the table and asked calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you chat? "Flame" Daniz secretly took a breath and squeezed a smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, I just feel weird, we all suspect that he joined the MI9. Monitor the things on the route as the captain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible... Klein picked up the white water cup and took a sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dishes he ordered, according to the classification, began to come up, the restaurant also presented two sweet, bubbling, pale gold pre-dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein no longer speaks, concentrates on enjoying the food, and feels that this is much better than the second-class restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violin sounds melodiously, the slight contact between the knife and fork and the porcelain plate occurs, and the blue and open sea outside the window is quiet, everything looks so beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Klein entered the dessert section, a crew member ran in and rushed to the table where Elland was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, there is a pirate ship!" He did not hide his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most passengers were shocked and stopped eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked up, his eyes dark and coldly looking at the opposite Daniz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flame" Daniz stiffened for a second, with a bitter smile, and lowered the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that this has nothing to do with me, do you believe it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein soothes the eyelid muscles that are almost twitching because of the performance, slowly sketching The corner of the mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess you are a scorpion! Daniz was angry and almost sipped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He keeps a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your wisdom is enough to judge everything."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Elland has quickly asked the situation, stood up and said to some panicked first class passengers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only one pirate ship, we have enough capacity to deal with it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ladies and gentlemen, please return to your room in an orderly manner. Waiting for the arrival of good news, believe me, the damage caused by chaos is far better than the attack of pirates. I don’t want to have such rumors in the future, saying that although our White Onye successfully defeated the pirates, there are five or six hundred and eighty. The passengers fell on their own. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his arrangement, under the maintenance of a crew member, Donna and others left the restaurant in turn and returned to their cabins, including grams. Ryan and "flame" Daniz.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to throw an olive branch immediately after finding the right candidate, and talking about the program and treatment, is enough to show that he is an extroverted, happy sailor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at him, went to the window and looked out, seeing a large ship with a red skull banner in the sea and sky. There are chimneys and sails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know them?" Klein put his hands in his pockets and stood behind the thick glass windows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz came to his oblique rear and looked at it for two seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red The Pirates of the Pirates, small and medium-sized forces.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The captain is the 'Sea Wolf' Johnson with a bounty of 900 pounds, and the first officer is a 'one-eyed' with a bounty of 500 pounds. Andelson. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pirate world, bounty is an important reference for identity and status.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering I don't currently have the ability to perform underwater activities very well, and letting the pirates board the ship can easily cause casualties for innocent people. Klein is silent for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do they know you?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course! "Daniz instantly straightened his back. "They are eligible to participate in the pirate's grand meeting. I used to play ass. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worthy of 3,000 pounds of famous pirates... Klein’s expression is unchanged:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do they have a telescope? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a must, even if the ship is controlled, there will be sailors standing on the observation deck, using a telescope to observe the surrounding situation and prevent being People raid. "Daniz replied in a hidden and disdainful way.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see it, this dangerous guy is a new adventurer, and probably the first time. Come to the sea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before was a famous bounty hunter? A member of the secret organization? Daniz subconsciously guessed the past of the German Sparrow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At this time, will the captain and the chief officer observe the side with a telescope? "Klein wanted to use 900 pounds and 500 pounds to represent it, but it was a bit rude.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Certainly, they must always grasp the object of looting. Happening. "Daniz replied slightly in confusion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not understand what the purpose of Gilman Sparo asked these questions, according to his ideas, If you have the same strength as the other side, you will definitely let the Hung Hom pirate group approach, find the opportunity to board their ship and kill everyone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Ryan turned his head and looked at Daniz, revealing Sven and his smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is fine. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you want to do? Don't laugh like this! Daniz suddenly panic and provokes the courage to fight.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remove your wig. Klein calmly commanded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? Daniz was puzzled and slowly removed the wig from his head.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a special bottle of pure dew from the clothing pocket and handed it over:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clean your eyebrows and face. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the mysterious "cleansing makeup" prepared for the clown before he was promoted to "no face", killing the rose school "Used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Klein naturally no longer needs this kind of thing, but has not been willing to throw it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Daniz is more and more puzzled, but before the other party has a real attack, he is not willing to get to the point where he can't return. He has to clean up the camouflage on his face and restore the original. Look like.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You stand here and head out." He pointed to the "flame" Daniz Road just behind the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz walked over with a vigilant and steady, standing behind the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at it for a few seconds, calmly asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have two choices, First, I climbed out and stood there conspicuously. Second, I was carrying my collar and hanging there conspicuously."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" Daniz asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein once again reveals a sly smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Showing you to the pirate group Look, the fourth sailor of 'Iceberg Lieutenant' should have enough weight to persuade them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, can't!" Daniz subconsciously Rejected was chosen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can imagine what the judges of the Hung Hom Pirates will find after they find out, or the "flame" Daniz is arrested, on board There is a terrible strong man, or the ship has been stared at by the "Iceberger" and the other pirates are immediately away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the gesture of my hang out determines where they want to go... Daniz sorrowfully thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein laughs more and more well:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a good person, Really, as long as you follow my instructions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, Daniz feels the indescribable sense of hunger, only to the body The flesh and blood and the soul of the body will be torn off at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weighed a second, he raised his hands halfway and grinned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Myself Come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz endured anger and grievances, turned and climbed out of the window, leaning against the balance and strength of perennial training, with the backward elbows For support, it is hung outside the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't try to escape, I am not a patient person." Klein's expression turned cold, and the words were warm and reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call...Daniz resisted the urge to release his elbow and jump straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirate ship in the distance, the crew responsible for observing the White Onyx sent a message to the "Sea Wolf" Johansson:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, there is a strange guy hanging out of the window!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John squat for a second, lifted up The telescope is in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly discovered the strange guy in his mouth because the position of the other person was too conspicuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, isn't this the "flame" Daniz? John Song brows and recognizes each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did he appear on the White Onyx? What does it mean to hang it outside? Is this the prey of the "Iceberger"? After a series of questions, the "Sea Wolf" made a judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raises his right hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All attention, stay away from this sea area immediately!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;305 In the room, Krivis holds the revolver and stands at the window Side, to prevent possible joint wars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Donna family was a little scared, did not return to their bedroom, just sat in the living room, waiting for the start of the shelling, Cecil and another bodyguard Teague Then stay with them and be alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Krivis’s slightly vicissitudes of his eyes showed an incomprehensible look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
