			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ragged room, the hat fell to the side, and the damaged Klein was separated from the huge demon Gilshies, who had the bat wings behind. The rice confrontation, the scene is quiet like a puppet show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Klein still has some spare time to do other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the "Master of Secrets" Rosago forcibly controlled him and Sharon, they were able to fight against the projection of "resentment". Manipulating the flames, summoning the flow of inflammation, killing the shadows drawn by Sharon. If the focus is wrong, the main target of Miss Resentment in Sequence 5, Rosago will be able to dismiss Klein early, and will not give He used the opportunity of the "dirty language" spell. Now, although Kline is definitely not as good as the other side, there is only one enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he can't do much. He can move without giving up control of Gil's, but not too fast, too fast. He can use the extraordinary ability that belongs to himself and has less spiritual burden, but he can't distract the magical items he carries, or shoot with a large range of movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before the target is controlled to a certain extent, many attacks can cause the other party to be pushed or stimulated, thus increasing the manipulation of the "spiritual line" Strength, and even signs of getting rid of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Klein must wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, his heartbeat suddenly accelerated two shots, and there was an unbearable fear and tension in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but suspect that the Gilshiis companion who was “distorted” was about to return! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not good! Emotions have fluctuated! Klein first glimpsed, and immediately used the skills of meditation to forcibly calm the inner fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;haha...he appears...the mood is fluctuating...the chance... Gil'his is happy in his heart, flashing a slow thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, relying on his extraordinary ability, he tried to amplify the fear and tension of German Sparrow and plant the seeds of emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If successful, he only needs a thorough "detonation", which will make the other party half-depleted, and can no longer affect themselves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No...how could it...no effect...his... mood swings... gone... Gilthias scarlet eyelids appear sluggishly It gradually filled up with emotions such as surprise, anger and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that I would be completely reconciled by Klein, who was slammed by the “desire apostle”, only to discover that nothing happened, and the head of Gilshiis’s bend The horns have burned out, but he has not tried to use the fluctuations of the mood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Klein probably understands what is going on:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilcias Not wanting to manipulate your fears and tensions, but failing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the induction to the emotional fluctuations, he must first use a few seconds to digest the situation, then take two or three seconds to make a decision, and finally spend more Time to organize thoughts, mobilize the corresponding extraordinary ability, at least 10 seconds before and after to complete the response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein from the detection of the problem, to calm down the good mood, it took a total of three or four seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Gilch's extraordinary ability is faced with a normal state of the enemy, naturally did not work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, the delay is too high! In this case, don't play fine operations... Klein spoke two words, and immediately calmed down the emotions of gloating and continued to deepen control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another ten seconds or so, Gilthias seems to want to understand where the problem lies, no longer considering the method of desire and emotion, relying on the devil to force The flesh and spirits, while confronting the manipulation from the "spirit of the spirit", slowly and arduously fan the bat wings behind them, so that the light blue flame entangled above is a little bit condensed and turned into a fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein can almost foresee a covered bombardment with a fireball next, so he does not hesitate to give a little spirituality, with his right thumb and The middle finger, hit a ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snapped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light blue flames swelled before the real molding, completely disintegrating, just like putting a grand fireworks behind Gilshies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician", "Manipulate the Flame"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilcias is still struggling, but the action has become slower and slower, more and more like a rusty puppet, so that Klein moves easily Then he escaped the devil language he had tried his best to make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three seconds, two seconds, one second... Klein suddenly stopped, his eyes locked in the head of Gilthias who lost his bent horns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the distance completely controls the "desire apostle" and turns him into a beggar, at least two and a half minutes, but Klein does not have this plan. He has no similar plans from the beginning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too time consuming, and Gilthias’s associates must be able to come back before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has only one purpose from start to finish, that is to control to a certain extent, so that the attack within the limit will not help Gilch Ace out of trouble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarlet eyes, sly face, saliva with saliva, reflected in Klein’s eyes, he opened his mouth and sent a word: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air bomb, sequence 5 air bomb! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is comparable to a bullet shot from a steam rifle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air bomb hit the forehead of Gilhies accurately, and he raised his head and pulled the "line of the spirit." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a blood hole in his eyebrow position that was not too deep, and the whole was not fatally hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the "Devil", for the "Apostles of Desire", they are all wearing a thick, hard armor, blood and flesh. Elasticity and resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein keeps making sounds, making air bombs, letting them hit the forehead of Gilthias one after another, gradually becoming one, at the same time, he Steady control of the "spirit of the spirit", not letting the other side pull to weaken the impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilcias made a staggering roar, desperately moving forward, trying to counterattack, but Klein’s movements were much more agile than him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his intention to liquefy, and because of the control of the "spirit of the spirit", undoubtedly failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An air bomb hit, completely smashing Gil's forehead and getting into his brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! Subsequent bullets flew in one after another, one after the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilhies's skull was finally opened, and the brain inside was covered with deep black gullies, which was already blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The £9,500 "slayer" scent began to dissipate quickly, but did not close his eyes because he had lost his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell slowly on the ground, and Klein stepped closer and extended his left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palm of the glove position, immediately split two bright red eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold and gloomy breeze followed, and the spirit of the "slaughter" Gilhies, along with the extraordinary characteristics of the black mist, screamed into the " Inside the creepy hunger, the finger that is fixed to the blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly, the gloves turned black again, but this time it was deep and pure, like a small number of same-colored dots squirming layer by layer. to make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
