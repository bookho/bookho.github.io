			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday morning, Klein, who was asleep naturally, prepared two toasts, a piece of butter, a bacon and a cup of coffee, and read the newspaper leisurely. With breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the terrible spell of "Spoken Language," he was relieved and not as tight as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Klein flipped through the Beckland Post and picked up the Tassok newspaper and saw a piece of news in the second edition:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At two o'clock in the morning, a fierce gun battle took place in the Red Brick Lane in the Eastern District. According to the police, this may involve conflicts between two gangs, one of which is notorious. Manger Party."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zangege Party... Red Brick Lane in the Eastern District... Klein suddenly came up with an idea, left the table and found Beckland map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just glanced at it and found that Red Brick Lane was not far from White Rum Street, and Ian Wright had a telegraph on White Rum Street. The bureau is infested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Brick Lane is where Ian Wright hides? What is the military’s special department and the intelligence personnel of Intis? I don't know what the result is... Klein forks the last bacon, puts it in the mouth, and chews it slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told the two sides about the situation of divination yesterday morning. They locked Ian’s position that night, and the efficiency was not high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a sip of coffee, Klein put down the newspaper and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he heard the doorbell humming and continually reverberating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Klein wiped his mouth with a napkin and walked to the door in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a new commission? I have been running outside for the sake of Ambassador Intis these days. I don’t know how many commissions I missed, how many potential customers I lost... I wasted my advertising money... If I continue to do so, my financial situation will be stretched. Klein thought a lot about it and reached out to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing two ladies outside, one is wearing a morning dress, quite a formal Mrs. Summer, her face is painted with a delicate makeup, more than at home For the beauty, it can't be seen at half point. A wide-brimmed hat with a fine black gauze hanging down, the dress is darker and more fluffy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Detective Moriarty, I have friends who want your help." Starling Summerer holding a silk hat, blue eyes There is no smile in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please come in." Klein pointed to the living room area, turned around and took the opportunity to tie the top button of the shirt and manage the black vest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starlin gently daggers, no longer speaks, and the lady who wears the black gauze covers the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very familiar with this place, and without the reminder of Klein, she easily found the sofa and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was asked to ask immediately, but thought about the style of Starling Summer, or asked with a smile:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coffee, or black tea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Somer in his eyes is looking for a quality of life, everywhere to reflect the sense of superiority Ms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Another lady took off the wide-brimmed hat with fine-grained black crepe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her facial features are good, but the combination is disappointing. In addition, her cheekbones are too high and her appearance is much larger than her actual age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little anger, a little sadness, a little embarrassment, a little fear... Klein read the lady’s emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not because he suddenly has the ability of the audience, but the other side is too obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, no matter whether it is coffee or black tea, it can't solve things." Stalin studied the posture of the magazine and tried to make herself sit more. There is a bit of temperament. "This is Mrs. Mary Gayle. She is a shareholder of Coim."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Gael, what do you want to entrust? "Klein sat down on the single sofa, leaning forward slightly and resting his arms on his lap." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't call me Mrs. Gael, call me Mary directly." Mary Gayer licked her lips. "I hope that you follow my husband and confirm whether he has a mistress. It is best to get substantial evidence. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the active promotion of the Goddess Church for many years, the Kingdom of Lun is more radical in marriage law than countries such as Fossac, Intis, and Rumburg. Those who stipulate a betrayal of marriage must pay a price for it, that is, the division of property will be at an absolute disadvantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that other private detectives, at least four of the ten commissions were for extramarital affairs... I didn’t expect that I also met... Klein said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The substance of the evidence is not good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will lend you a first The latest portable camera." Mary did not hesitate to answer, "As long as you can get the evidence, I will pay you 10 pounds. If you simply confirm that there is no mistress, you can only get 3 pounds." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you mean a so-called portable camera with two-thirds of my head? 10 pounds, this price is not low... Klein has recently focused on entrepreneurship and has some understanding of the latest cameras. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hesitated for two seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you must provide details of your husband and the rules of his activities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...no problem "Mary stayed for a second, then said with all her strength." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your help, I hope you don't tell anyone about this." Starling shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Klein suddenly sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a People with very strict confidentiality often get into trouble for this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the hall of the Earl Wolfe, a man and a woman danced in the melody of the violin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey carrying a cup of pale gold champagne, "accidentally" met the Ambassador of the Republic of Luis in Lun, Becker Lang Jean Dan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the most beautiful lady I have ever seen." Baker Lang, a little bit of scum, has a sorrowful kiss. Audrey wears white. The hand of the gauze glove is back, and the eyes are warm and bold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey’s eyelids, a chuckle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Intis "Speaking style?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, for beautiful things, we never praise." Becker laughed, "if not considering Lun The ethos of the kingdom, I might call you an angel for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Pervert... Audrey maintains an elegant smile:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Luen and the Intis are really different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, this reminds me of one Joke, please allow me to take the liberty." Becker squeezed his eyes. "After spending a wonderful moment with the beautiful girl, most Lun men would say, oh dear, I want to smoke a cigarette, and Most of the Intis men would say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately paused, Audrey squinted his head, endured nausea, and pretended to be ignorant.道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;"What would you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most of the Intis men would say, hey, baby, I have to go back, can't be my wife. Found." Becker smiled in a toast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The people who are self-sufficient always have extra charm." Audrey smiled politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her beautiful, crystal-green eyes suddenly look to the rear of Ambassador Becker:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sorry, a friend is looking for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
