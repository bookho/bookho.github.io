			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, the shadows of the carriages and horses were dragged by the setting sun for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who has already confessed to Benson and Melissa, has had dinner at Blackthorn Security, and is taking a public carriage with the old Neil to the Docklands. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wore the original cheap dress, because he was worried that similar situations would be prone to conflicts - if you broke the tuxedo that you usually waited for, then Just distressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun was burning, the carriage stopped, still the old black robes and the same color round felt hats. I care about the eyes of others looking towards the diagonally opposite "Dragon Bar". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the bar is a little far apart, even if the door is heavily closed, Klein can still hear the shouting of a wave above it, which seems to be Which "hero" is cheering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just approaching, he suddenly felt the induction, turned his head and looked at the cargo warehouse opposite the bar, and saw a burly, dress-up system in the hidden corner of the building. man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man carries a huge gray-white mechanical box with a heavy-duty rifle in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clear pipe connection between the gray-white metal box and the same-color rifle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"High-pressure steam rifle?" Klein whispered and turned to look at the old Neil. "Can this bar get this weapon?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a military tube product! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the extracted phlogiston is used, the size and weight of the high-pressure steam backpack is still amazing, and it must be affordable by the real iron warrior, and the bullet launched by it With a very high speed, the damage is quite amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a proper aiming, it can almost be equal to a bad sniper rifle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Old Neil looked at the past with his eyes open, and his face was confused. "Is there something going wrong?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accident? Klein looked around and found out that there were still a few men with rifles on their hands searching for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Old Neil approached the bar and asked the big man who was standing outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big man who knows the big man clearly knows the old Neil, and his face muscles shake and smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The bar was almost demolished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that a wanted guy bought the material and was recognized, so it became like this . . . My Lord, what did he do, how dangerous it is, need to be treated like this? Seeing those guns, my legs are soft, and it’s softer than a red-haired Shani ghost!”< Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not sure what the identity of the wanted person, and even the guys who come here to buy materials are mixed with extraordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wanted guy? Do you know what he is?" asked Neil quite interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call, call Tris?" The big man answered with a little uncertainty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher" Tries? Klein nodded and understood what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tries didn’t know that he had been suspected by Joyce Mayer, so he swayed into the underground trading market to buy materials, and the result was “mechanical heart”. Or the "offers" and "nights" team line people recognized, triggered a fierce conflict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have he been caught?" Klein ordered a silver cane with silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the surrounding posture seems to have not yet...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;彪大大 shaking his head slightly, using The chin pointed to the top of the opposite cargo warehouse:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He rushed out before the horrible guy arrived, hey, I have never seen him more than him. Those who can run!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, you haven't seen the true ability of the "Assassin", otherwise you will be taken to an unspeakable place for re-education... Klein whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the trading market still open?" Old Neil turned to the point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" just recovered." The big man answered affirmatively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good." Old Neil walked two steps, reaching out his right hand and pushing the heavy door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein followed closely and walked in, almost sultry and sultry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a boxing ring in the center of the "Dragon Bar". Two naked men are fighting fiercely. The supporting objects screamed in a scream, and some of them were vulgar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil did not care for them, led Klein to bypass the boxing and walked to a billiard room behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people in the billiard room holding the club, talking and laughing, seeing the old Neil push the door in, suddenly quiet for a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirmed, they quietly let go of the position, letting Neil and Klein pass the secret door behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously walked through several rooms, and Klein was very cheerful and saw a place with the size of the classroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people standing here with a bottle of cans, others walking between the former, or examining, or communicating, or price comparison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All proceeds should be given to one-twentieth of Swift, ah, he is the owner of the Dragon Bar, the captain of the former 'Career' squad , older than I am, is an old guy who wants to die from alcoholism." Old Neil introduced a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it and sincerely commented:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very profitable business. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the cost is just to provide the venue and shelter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you look at an item and don't bring enough money, you can go to Swine to borrow. Of course, he will charge very high interest. ......" At this point, the old Neil was a bit gnashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, like the casino, it will provide usury service... Kline, with a cane, looked around and curiously asked:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Swein is a 'voyager'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the "Calculator" squad should In the position of sequence 7. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, just the 'furious people', Tingen does not belong to the coast, where the goddess' church is stronger than the storm master." He laughed. "In fact, Swein had the opportunity to become a 'voyager', but he was afraid of losing control and chose to give up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is waiting for the bar Does the boss have an almost uncontrollable experience, and suddenly there is a strange phenomenon on the left side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be something hidden in it, whispering, telling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned his head and saw a pale young man wearing a worn linen shirt and blue-gray trousers unique to the working class. Very sloppy but mad, and constantly chanting something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His inspiration is high... or distorted?" Klein frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the “inspiration” of the other party that just ignited their “inspiration”! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, the perception of "inspiration" will definitely create a certain interaction, and it is almost impossible to pass others, but this "other" refers to the ability to display The "Psychic" and the powerful people with similar characteristics, Kline is such an extraordinary person that it is difficult to distinguish it. Only when the "inspiration" of the other party is high to a certain extent, or abnormal distortion occurs, he can find out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of sight contact, the pale, dark-skinned young man took a step, came over, with a half-sleeping half-mad expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
