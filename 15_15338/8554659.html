Instead of "the sun" asked "justice" Audrey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"""""""""""" , Antignus, Amon, Jacob, Tamara, is the five major families that support the establishment of the Tudor dynasty, second only to the blood emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "In which, the Amon family is the most mysterious, leaving the least history, seems to be distorted by what power, and concealed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the 'Five Seas The king of Nast has heard such a message that the Amon family is a family of blasphemy, who hold the mystery of stealing the power of the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Also, the Amon family claims to be descendants of the ancient Sun God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek.Berg heard a faint ambiguity within his range of mythological knowledge. Ancient sun gods exist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Giant King Olmer, the imaginary dragon, Angelweed, the alien king Kwashtun, the king of the elves, Sunia Solem, Destroy the devil Wolf Fregra, the vampire ancestor Lilith, the undead bird ancestor Gregory Carrie, the demon king Fabbti, the eight ancient gods did not have a head of the 'sun' authority...” Dairik seriously thought about this problem, "If you really want to associate, create the Lord of all, the omnipotent God, but show the power of the 'sun' field, is the Amon family his descendants?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp See "Sun" did not speak, "downside down" Alger touched the chin of the chin:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Amon family was a thousand years ago The ancient family is almost the same as history. I am very curious. Why did the gentleman you met appear around Silver City? What is his purpose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Yes, the Amon family is "downside down", "just", their "world", why can he come out? Silver City in our surrounding area ...... why he agreed after a "guest" of the request, but did not fulfill their commitments, strange to leave, and caused a loss of control of the entire team, ah, in addition to the captain who ...... What does he want? What is he looking for? If he is really a descendant of the Lord, perhaps his purpose is the same as mine: find the cause of the Cataclysm in the old age, and figure out the truth of the curse... "The Sun" Dairik once thought of it, and then shook his head for a while: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. 'Inverted Man', I can't answer your question, this is what I want to figure out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Algero responded with disappointment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you talk to the former captain next door to see if you can find new information. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, he thought about it and said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" However, You must be careful and cautious, I think that person is very dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very dangerous? Do you think so?" "Sun" Dairik is quite surprised Asked the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of the six-member council also think so! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted man" looked at the towering dome and silently took a breath:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The person who doesn't think so, the brain is not normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing "The Sun" is still a little confused, he shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole exploration team is only alive and he is alive. It is only this matter itself, which is enough to show that he has a big problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Staying in the dungeon for the runaway for forty-two years, but still very clear and sensible, this shows his eccentric!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "With the mysterious Amon, the danger is obvious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Dyrick usually thinks but doesn't string together. At this time, I heard it suddenly and immediately, and said sincerely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Mr. 'Hanging man'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relishing, observing the "justice" Audrey held back the urge to reach out and cover his face, I feel that the "sun" is simply simpler than myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw that everyone’s curiosity was met, even the gloomy “world” gentleman adjusted the sitting position slightly, and the “sun” seemed to have nothing else. I wanted to ask for help, so I looked at the top of the bronze long table and smiled lightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool, I applied for a separate exchange." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come again... Klein burst into laughter and sigh: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."< Br /> /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately blocked the "upside down" of their senses, rather than isolating themselves from the "just" lady, mainly because they were worried about other people being idle and arbitrarily Communication, thus revealing the "world" is just the truth of a repeater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting the prompt, Audrey smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected 'fool' I have three new pages of Russell's diary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no guilty concealment after the "Golden Card" was stolen by the "fool" Instead of going to the Kingdom Museum, nothing happened, and I begged my father generously. I got another chance to read the "notes" this week after the exhibition ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey thinks this will make you look open and is the best way to avoid suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you always have a guilty look and don’t do what you should do according to normal logic, then there is no doubt before the steam church, and there will be problems later. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And according to her own experience, I believe that the first few pages of a diary will often reveal more things, so the main memory of the first three pages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait for the "fool" opening, she added and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand that this is not A thing that needs to be communicated separately, but I hope to sing the 'Magician' again for a week or two, so that even if she later knows that you need Russell's diary, I will not doubt that I am 'just.' "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw Foels and Hugh once this week, and by the guidance of the topic, naturally said the collection of those Russell notes were The dog Su Shi played a bite and was difficult to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, she no longer has to conceal that Mr. Fool’s needs Russell’s diary, but she uses the ability of “reading the mind” to simulate the Buddha. Ers thought, I think the other person would think like this:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Is that a diary? That is Russell’s diary to record his secrets? Even Mr. I value it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amount, I remember Miss Audrey, and so on, her diaries were just bitten by dogs a few days ago. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this too clever?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to let the other person think so, Julie hopes to hide for at least another week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After becoming a "reader", she not only can directly see the target's gas field and emotional color, read shallow ideas, but also preliminary Simulating the thinking of others, so she realized one thing, that is, in the process of "guiding" others, try not to have abrupt, unlogical and logical behaviors, only the details are soft enough and reasonable enough to make the goal fundamentally I can’t detect that I’m being guided and arranged to be a qualified “reader”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soft", "reasonable" is the two most important words! Audrey concluded in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——She went back to Russell’s “notes” again to avoid irrationality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a “reader”, and I’ve long recognized that “Magician” is one of the two people I recommend... Klein laughs at me. Laughter:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His question was quite convincing, because after he got the "Book of Secrets", his biggest shortcomings in the field of occultism have been made up, and the mysteries of the other gods, the knowledge of the sequence, he has mastered a lot, casually You can cope with Miss Justice by throwing it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not mentioning the "psychologist" formula, it is still a good friend... Klein spit in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey has long thought about this problem and held it for a second:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' Fool's Mr., I want to ask a question, why do you say 'The Card of the Dragon' hides the mystery of the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good question! Klein smirked and said with a gesture that gave you a look and your own understanding, and said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 0, Black Emperor."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sequence 0? Is there a sequence of 0? Above sequence 1 is sequence 0? Is this a sequence of gods? "Black Emperor" is a god? There is a series of problems in Audrey’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made her both surprised and happy, and satisfied and shocked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resist the excitement and unspeakable excitement in her heart, she took a breath and showed the three pages of Russell's diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein got his hand and quickly glanced at it and confirmed that it was not the one he had seen:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "On February 23, 1143, I have been through this world for more than a week. I have to write something and dump some things, otherwise I feel like I will go crazy." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I write in Simplified Chinese, sure no one can interpret, this world is all alphabetic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Russell Gustav now, but I will never forget my real name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"黄涛!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did I get through, I don't know, I seriously thought about it for a long time, only to think of a few days before crossing, I bought a very mysterious The silver medal, which is engraved with some strange symbols and patterns, is super interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, after crossing here, it does not appear again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nb Sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not my golden finger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, this is a world similar to ancient Europe, after the Renaissance, artillery And guns have appeared, but they are quite rudimentary and primitive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I Huang Tao. Russell Gustav, as a fan of online novels I used to like to go through the flow of technology and learned a lot of useful things. I have read the relevant knowledge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly what I am doing. Stage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, I found that my TM is not good! I have forgotten it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"God let me through, but did not give me excellent memory, did not give me the system, did not give me a two-way door, then how to mix!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well, start with some details, wait for me to have money, and then ask a bunch of craftsmen, inventors and scientists to help, I am only responsible for the idea!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Long time no There is such an emotion that is full of expectations for the future. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, I still want to be a bit old and mom..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this The world's entertainment is too monotonous, and the maids are not very good at both of them. They are braving the rural soil and squatting, so that I expected the red-sleeved nights to go bankrupt. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Lin Gao five hundred waste has not been finished, my sisters have a lot to be brushed, my pesticides and chickens are being Waiting for me to be lucky, I still feel a little embarrassed. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
