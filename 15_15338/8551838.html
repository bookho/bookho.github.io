			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Crested Sesima turned his head and leaned forward a little. "Then you swear by the holy things." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he bent over and lifted the silver-white box at his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holy things? Is that sacred object that makes you known as the "Sword of the Goddess"? Klein was curiously watching the every move of the senior deacon in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crested put the box on his lap, and the dark green eyes turned dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted his right hand and pressed it down. The surface of the box-like silver-white box suddenly broke and collapsed, and the tide subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost in the same second, Klein felt that the surrounding Huimang was all attracted to the past and attracted to the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he saw the interior of the alchemy was dark, except for the elegant gas lamp itself surrounded by the metal grid, except for the box that was filled with silver and white, the scene was exceptionally different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the crisp sound, the core of the night, one of the nine senior deacons, Cressai Sesima opened the box and revealed the one placed inside. Put a pure white bone sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the bone sword, just saw this short sword less than one meter, Klein intuitively thinks that its main material is bone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the alchemy room where the gas lamp is silently burning but dark and dark, the short sword quietly exudes a pure white, moisturizing glow, like a late night The high moon hangs in the heart of the moon, like a lighthouse that identifies the direction in the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks pure and flawless, but if you look closely, you will find layers of symbols and logos in the depths, and these mysterious patterns and swords The body constitutes an inseparable whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the holy sword and suddenly found that he could not move his eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sight was sucked in, and the brown eyelids slowly lost their luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Crestel moved up the box and left the white dagger away from the original position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was sober, and finally broke free from the nightmare that he couldn’t escape from his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his eyes to the side and solemnly asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, I need my hand Is it on this holy sword?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, come over." Crestel’s voice is like mourning a pillow book. Sing a lullaby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stood up, squinted, and moved a small step in a small step, because it was too dark, he couldn’t even see the senior deacon in front. Legs and the other pair of slightly outdated leather boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop." Crestel calmly opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kleinton stayed in the footsteps, stood in the same place, quickly glanced at the pure white bone sword with the corner of his eye, and then moved away with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following that short second of memory, he bent down his back and extended his right hand, accurately pressing on the holy sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of ice-cooling is not soaring through his skin, so that his distracting thoughts and worried emotions are instantly smoothed, like a Go down to the countryside behind you, sit on the roof, smell the harvest, quietly look up at the night and look up at the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You follow me," Crestel said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then heard the senior deacon in front of him using the Hermes language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I swear to you with my real name and my spirituality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, Klein, from now on, will never know how to play" 'The person disclosed the corresponding details."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you violate the rules, let you punish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Please witness my vows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein converges on all sorts of minds, following the senior deacon of Sesima, humming the pledge in Hermes Again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vagueness, he felt that he and the pure white bone sword, and a certain existence in infinity, established a subtle concealed connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting his right hand, he draws a blushing moon on his chest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lie beautiful god!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lie beautiful god!" Crestel smiled and followed the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he slammed the lid and pressed his right hand slowly and slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hour was lighted up, and the light from the gas lamp filled the room again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw that the senior deacon of Sesima had dyed the dark black eyes and restored the dark green at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped back and sat down on his high back chair, frowning and wondering:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;“Playing the law?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creiter cleared his throat and did not answer the question directly, instead he smiled:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What I am going to say next, you may be confused, it will be a bit puzzled, but I will not explain why, because it involves the secret of the church."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you become an archbishop or a senior deacon, you are qualified to know... Klein looked at the opposite side of the erected lord Sesima, and replied in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you become an archbishop or a senior deacon, become the core of the church, you are allowed to know." Crestel emphasized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was busy and seriously nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crested put the silver box back to his feet and picked up the right leg:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "In the long history, the genius of the extraordinary people of the church generations has gradually explored the most evasive way out of control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this approach The core is the name of the potion, it is not only the key, but also the key.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Klein’s thought-like expression, Crestel continued: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We found that the names of potions all point to a certain group of groups, and the corresponding groups have similar and unique behavior patterns. In short, it is magic. The name of the drug contains some specific rules. Different potion names contain different rules. When we strictly follow the rules contained in our own potions, the risk of losing control is minimized."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Similar to my 'Divinity Code'?" Klein seized the opportunity to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not yet easy for me to explain the "justice" and "downside down"... At the same time, he silently spits in the heart<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Crestede gave a positive answer. "When we follow the rules of conduct, it seems to be the type of potion name description. Groups, that is, we are in the 'playing' the name of the potion name, um, this is the 'playing method', you have to remember that everyone's spirituality is special, unique, and taking the same potion Compared with the people, the core part of the rules of conduct that need to be observed will not change. The corresponding borders have their own characteristics and will not be similar. Therefore, the experience of others can only be used as a reference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your reminder, I will remember it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cresett smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"This is a cumulative experience from generation to generation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Using the 'playing method', we are not only mastering the potion, or In digestion, just like digesting the food we eat, when you really digest the potion and digest the residual spiritual influence, you will get a unique, wonderful feeling, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand. Digestion, the word, very appropriate..." Klein pretended to be thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc. Crestel explained it in detail for a while, he asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Lord Sesima, since the name of the potion is the key, the key, how did the original extraordinary people get them? I heard that it was recorded on the slate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this statement is correct." Crested calmly replied, "But all the above are ancient names. After the birth of the potion name, some come from 'God Kai', some come from extraordinary The summary of the person himself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slowly nodded and snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord Sesima, since 'playing the law' is so effective, why doesn't the church tell every night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, this is The secret of the church, when you become an archbishop or a senior deacon, you can understand why." Crestel replied in a positive color, "Well, you should go back upstairs, inform other nights, let him One by one down, I will examine the last step. "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; This is to let Fry they can not leak" - play "? Klein got up thinking and left according to the etiquette of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked through the corridor, along the steps, back to the Black Thorns Security Company, and saw that Dunn was sniffing the pipe at the bottom of the underground, I don’t know how long it waited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the mouth is tilted, and Klein takes the initiative to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There should be no problem, Sethi Lord Ma asked me to inform Frye to talk to them one by one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, this is the last step, which also shows that there is no problem in front." Take the pipe and tell the story to the night entertainment room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Frye and Siga deep into the ground, Klein suddenly remembered something and said quickly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Captain, is it necessary to replace the Loyan, who monitors the Chanis Gate, and the Leonard who monitors the madhouse? Yes, there is also Cohenli on vacation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Deng stunned and squeezed the forehead:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I forgot..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He paused and smiled lowly: "However, things are not too complicated. One of the benefits of the senior deacons personally examining is that you don't have to take a telegram to the church, no more complicated paperwork. You can give conclusions on the spot and you can give you the formula and main materials of the 'Clown' potion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not bad." Curingly expecting what will happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour and a half, there is a clear doubt in the dignified expression After Kornley walked out of the alchemy room, Klein was slammed into the ground and once again confronted the senior deacon, "The Sword of the Goddess", Crestel Sesima. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the golden brown-haired dark-eyed lord did not sit again, but stood there, letting the coolness of the ground slightly blow his Black trench coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cresett's two collars are tall and standing, hiding his chin in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
