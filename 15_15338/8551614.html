			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray and white mist is unchanging, the deep red and illusory stars are hanging far or near, and Klein sits in the magnificent palace like the giant residence. Quietly looking at everything that is familiar to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, he took back his gaze and let a yellow-brown parchment appear in front of him, then wrote a call to edit the mantra. Ceremony:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Point a candle to symbolize yourself;”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Made with a spiritual wall a holy environment;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Into the candlelight, into the full moon oil, chamomile pure dew, deep sleep flower powder and other materials (note: in this step, do not need too Pay attention to it, because it is to summon yourself);"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Missing the following mantra:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Me! (Old Hermes, Giant, Dragon, Elvish, must be shouted)"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I summon in my name (Hemis ):"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fool who does not belong to this age, the mysterious ruler above the fog, the king of yellow and black who is in good luck."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp; Carefully examined three times, Klein wrote the divination statement at the bottom: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is dangerous to conduct the above ceremony outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, he vomited, put the pen, untied the silver chain in the cuff, and held it with the left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until the citrine pendant is suspended above the parchment, only to touch the divination sentence, he converges and enters the state of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is dangerous to conduct the above ceremony outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The above ceremony is dangerous in the outside world "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After meditation seven times, Klein opened almost black eyes Hey, I saw the citrine pendant turning counterclockwise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means negation, meaning no danger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can try it." Klein is busy letting the items in front of him disappear, extending spirituality to wrap themselves, simulating the feeling of falling down. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the bedroom, because the early use of the spiritual wall sealed the entire room, Klein directly cleaned the desk and set a minty candle The most central. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed his right hand on the candle, and used the spiritual friction to ignite the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When swaying in the dim light, Klein dropped the corresponding essential oil, pure dew and herbal powder into the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tranquility of the scent is instantly filled, and the room is sometimes bright and faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two steps, Klein looked at the candle that symbolizes himself and shouted out in the giant language:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he switched to Hermes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I call in my name:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fool who does not belong to this era, the mysterious master above the fog, the yellow of good luck The king of black."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice just fell, suddenly felt the swaying dim candle and the surrounding quiet fragrance mixed into a whirlpool, madly absorbed its own spirituality . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw the candlelight stop shaking, standing there quietly, and dyed the gray color, stretching to the size of the palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is summoned... Ah, maybe I need to respond to the fog. It’s really troublesome to call myself..." Klein He squeezed his forehead and stupid forehead and silently said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowed down for a dozen seconds, stepped back four steps, and once again came over the fog, saw the top of the ancient long table circled again and again. Light pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comes from the quirky symbol behind the high back chair - the "innocent eye" symbolizing the hidden part and the "distorted line" symbolizing the change An eccentric symbol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just made a touch of the touch, and immediately immediately called "I! I call in my name" "Followers who are not in this era" The "mysterious ruler above the fog" and other cursing sounds, and saw the incoming spirituality and the swaying light lines mixed into an illusory, unformed door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This door is swaying and wanting to open, Klein immediately has inspiration, giving a strong idea to push it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost instantaneous, innocent fog and magnificent palaces were suddenly pulled, creating a slight invisibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This circle laps and rushes toward the illusory, unformed gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, no matter how Klein promoted, the door could not be opened, and all the movements eventually fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the ‘Summoning Gate’ is not fully formed?” Klein retracted his mind and frowned at the cause of the failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——He casually named the illusory door as the “gate of summoning”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it’s my spiritual insufficiency, I can’t build a complete 'call to the door'... Wait until I advance to the sequence 8, become a 'clown', and get through the early days. In the dangerous phase, you can try again. Maybe there will be no problem at that time..." Klein nodded gently and probably understood what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experiment gave him great confidence and strong encouragement, because this is the event of divination and eternal glory, he made the fog for the first time. The mysterious space on it produces a different reaction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is always one day, I have to figure out all the secrets here!" Klein made an announcement in excitement and fell into the innocent under the spiritual package. The fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the bedroom, Klein quickly extinguished the candle and ended the ceremony Then clean up the desk and lift the wall of spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wind that suddenly burst, he yawned, fell to the bed, just wrapped his quilt and went to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a fascinating, fragmented dream, Klein suddenly woke up and found himself sitting in the living room at home, holding a copy of "Tingen City People newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The captain will not come again? He was stunned first, and immediately looked at the belly window with a good air and a funny look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the door opened, and Dunn, wearing a black over-the-knee trench coat, walked in with a cane and a pipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still wears a half-height black top hat, still has a faint gray eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun came to the living room and sat down on the single sofa, leisurely placing his right leg on the left leg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put his cane, took off his hat, and leaned back, so quietly, as if looking at Klein in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, what do you want to do today... Klein is amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to expose himself to knowing that this is a dream, he pretended not to be affected and continued to look at the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes, Klein, who had turned the newspaper over and over again, saw Dunn staring at himself quietly and thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, you are so uncomfortable... Klein can’t sit still, he folded the newspaper, put it aside, smiled at Dunn. Underneath, then go to the kitchen to take out the rag and pretend to wipe the table and coffee table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, you see, my dream is so simple, so ordinary, so boring, nothing to watch, you go! If you change a ghost, I pretend to be scared and let you complete the "nightmare" achievement! He prayed silently, but looked up and saw Dunn's faint, gray eyes that seemed to be thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a silent, unchanging gaze, Klein wiped the furniture clean, cleaned the room, and was too tired in his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that makes him most tired is Dunn Smith, who has been quietly looking at himself as if thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how busy it was, he finally saw the captain put down his right leg, stood up, then took a cane, put on his hat, and walked to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein held his breath and watched Dunn leave his home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't help but raise his right hand and make a goodbye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... When everything was back to normal, Klein took a long breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a nightmare! He wants to cry without tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, West End, Phillips Department Store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most upscale department store in the Kingdom of Lun, open only to nobles and wealthy members with membership. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s always parked one after another in a luxury carriage with different badges. It’s not only a shopping destination but also a staff Strictly restricted, it has become a well-known social place. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey took the maid Anne and the Golden Retriever Su Shi, in the waiter’s hospitality, walked off the carriage and entered the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, she can see Miss Viscount, the Countess, or the girl whose parents have a prominent status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She maintains an elegant attitude, greets one by one with normative but not rigorous rituals, with different entry points and different aristocratic brief exchanges, for example, In the face of a certain countess, I have to praise how fit her new dress is. When I am chilling with a certain Baroness, I have to say how outstanding her husband is in the upper house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Audrey always did not do well enough in this session, too capricious and self, but now, she doesn’t even have to spend more time thinking Perfect response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of the "audience", most of the aristocratic women's emotions and thoughts are like writing on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second floor, Audrey turned to a shop selling ready-to-wear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter in the store is a young girl who is dressed in a black and white interlaced dress with a stubborn shoulder-shouldered blonde. It is the "arbitrator". Hugh Dilcha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey did not show her face to the big dog Su Shi, and the other side instantly understood her meaning and ran to another counter cheerfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid Anne had to hurry up and try to pull Susie back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make it beautiful! Audrey sighed and walked to Hugh Dilcha, pretending to watch a different style of dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What do you want to meet me here?" Hugh and aloud, while whispering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is very young, just like a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
