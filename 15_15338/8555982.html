			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, Klein switched to the "fool" that looked down at everything, in an unpredictable state, and slammed it first:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river in front of him has a rushing, white words creeping and reshaping:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The following is the exploration process of your loyal servant Arodus records, you can choose to speed up or skip some scenes at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the sentence solidified for two seconds, the picture suddenly came closer, and Klein came to Icanth Bernard's side, but no one found him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and felt that there were living people nearby, living scenes, no false feelings, and people were unusually immersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can also speed up or skip certain scenes... The body of this mirror in Arrods is actually a virtual reality home theater... Klein does not endure Stayed in the spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again looked at the members of the "Mechanical Heart" and found that the first was an old man wearing a white priest's robe and wearing a cleric's soft hat. His face was unusually kind. The expression is calm and gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Archbishop, everyone is ready." Icons approached the old man and took a ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop... This is the Archbishop of the Beckland Parish of Steam and Machinery, Horamick Haydn of the Semi-God? The heart of the machine is really cautious, not careless...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may also carry a "1" seal and do divination in advance, after all, they master There is a "sneak peek" approach, but fortunately, I can basically determine the anti-divination of the fog or the ability to interfere with divination. It is like "the card of the 亵渎", so that the result is the most normal and natural and the most unsuspecting side. Otherwise, maybe something will be exposed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the scene I met with Miss Sharon has a certain probability of being reproduced, because for myself, It’s not a hazard. Just look at whether the “resentment” interferes with the instinct of divination. It can affect the “mechanical heart” attempt, and so on. The great probability of “mechanical heart” is to rely on Arrodes, just now and Looking at the performance before, it is not impossible to make a mosaic to please me. Klein thought with a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Horamick Haydn drew a triangular emblem on his chest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beginning, God will protect us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly ten extraordinary people are coming down, and Klein is close behind, there is no "fast forward." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has always been curious about the low-sequence fighting style of "Mechanical Heart" and intends to take this opportunity to see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, what is the real shot of the demigod and half-man, what secrets are hidden in the mausoleum of the Amon family, is also a matter of great concern to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ladder of black marble polished through a thousand or two years of scouring, still maintains enough hardness, no signs of corrosion, "mechanical heart" The members followed it all the way to the bottom of the earth and saw the asymmetrical stone pillars with a Quaternary character and the knife-like axe-like pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pillars are separated on either side of a wide road, with a huge, heavy, facing dark gray stone door in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shimen has cracked the gap that allows the two to be discharged, and the inside is deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of "Mechanical Heart" are not in a hurry to go in, carrying a good lighting lantern, carefully searching the outer area for a circle, and found nothing valuable. Items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the scheduled plan, the first group to do the initial cleanup." Icons, with the consent of the Archbishop, pressed the top of the hat, the fluffy hairstyle again Pressed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean up? Just next to Klein chewed the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the most sturdy, the most sturdy two "mechanical heart" male players each put down the black long box on the back and hit them. Open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the long box, one is a thick and heavy iron-black cannon tubular item, which is engraved with a dense and strange pattern, one is a delicate and exquisite strange gun, and a pale gold bullet chain is inserted therein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the two players picked up the cannon-shaped item and walked to the open door of the stone door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other "Mechanical Heart" member picked up a strange gun, hung the chain, followed by a slightly slower two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two looked at each other, the former’s barrels and barrels quickly brightened, drawing a blazing mark and pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A golden fireball like a miniature sun flew out of the "barrel" and flew into the darkness and darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is slightly trembled, and the violent light emerges from the cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Mechanical Heart" members carrying the "barrel" were obviously sunk and their feet were trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! Bang! Bang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used the extraordinary weapon again and again, letting the golden "cannonball" shoot at different positions one after another, and the tomb was swaying but there was no The dust spilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmed down a bit, and the player carrying the strange gun took two steps and pulled the trigger:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;哒哒哒哒哒哒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of machine guns shouted, and one by one pale gold bullets flew out, purifying the dangers of darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Isn't that the fire-washing effect I always wanted? And it is used to purify bullets, exorcism shells and other extraordinary consumables... good luxury! Is this the "mechanical heart" way of fighting? Klein saw his eyes round and his mouth slightly open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a burst of indiscriminate bombing, Icons in the echo of the rumble, high voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The second group will be followed up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And...Klein feels that he is already numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group is also two players, they use a reel made of different leather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They read the mantra in a short way, fired the scrolls and threw them inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building behind Shimen was suddenly shrouded in soft, pure light, and a drop of pale golden sacred raindrops slammed down and "cleaned" everything in the range. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein Wood looked at this scene and suddenly felt ridiculous:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and so, you are not Come to the archaeological? Are you not a professional "archeologist"? Clean up in this way, not afraid of the mausoleum directly collapsed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was flashing, the second group was cleaned up and shouted to ICON:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Deacon, as expected, the building structure has not been destroyed.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are obviously prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, keep moving forward." Icons made an order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walked in the middle, through the stone gate, I saw a group of smudges and fragments on the ground, so that people could not tell that they were active here. What kind of monsters are there, and it is impossible to guess what the organs that used to presuppose this place have any effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few waves of "washing the ground", as long as there is no early avoidance, the extraordinary people below the high sequence can't hold it... Klein once again deeply understands What is violent aesthetics, what is simple and rude and unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following process, the scene just appeared repeatedly, the players of "Mechanical Heart" went smoothly, explored one area after another, and sometimes harvested some The extraordinary features that begin to gather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no mural..." Seeing the main tomb room in sight, the steam and mechanical church archbishop Horamick Haydn stopped and wondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half historian of Klein has the same puzzle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, the tombs of a noble member have more or less things that indicate their status and glory. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the tomb becomes a mausoleum, even a mausoleum, with plenty of space, it is common to use murals to tell the master’s life, which is more ancient. In the more obsessive era, it is not uncommon, or even the most common means - the first thing humans learn is painting, not writing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there is no similar mural in a Quaternary tomb of the great aristocracy. It is indeed somewhat weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the question of the Archbishop, Icons immediately told the players to spread out in groups of two, search nearby and look for the corresponding traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it all, Klein couldn’t help but want to "fast forward" and want to see the results directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he found that the two "Mechanical Hearts" members in the left corner suddenly became three! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them looks exactly the same as Icons Bernard, and the hair fluffy to the top of the hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...Klein was a glimpse first, and there was speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought just now, "Icons" went to the team member closest to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a discovery?" He cleared his throat and lowered his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team turned around and saw that Iconsler was deaconed and relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No..." His voice did not fall, and the "Iconser" in front of him suddenly turned into a human skin and covered him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale human skin wrapped around him tightly, and the face began to outline the facial features. In the process, there was no extra voice, no change was Triggered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, there is a light under the human skin, just like the light when the sun rises! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human skin immediately became translucent and was quickly emptied by burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black whip was immediately drawn and hit on it, making its movements noticeably slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this battle, slowness is the "original sin", an extraordinary weapon, a burning scroll, a pale gold bullet, and To, drown the man's skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the gorgeous light, countless ashes fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all shimmered, slowly, "struggling" to start gathering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a “human shadow”... Kline turned his attention to the “Mechanical Heart” member who had just been attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man pulled his neckline and pulled out a talisman with a lot of sun-related symbols and magic signs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, the Archbishop let us put on these things!" He said with a lantern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein discovered that his needle has the meaning of peace in the night, his ring with the storm, his belt gives the real strength Sense...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not all magical items, most of them belong to spell ornaments and extraordinary weapons, the effect will soon decay, but they are also very valuable! It’s not a “craftsman” or a rich man, but you can’t get it so much... Is this the “mechanical heart” fighting style? Burning money... Klein suddenly felt the feeling of being hit, and it took a long time to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the characteristics of the human skin shadow have been gathered, it is like a huge diamond, there are countless sections in the reflection of light, and each face There are different faces on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces are densely packed and layered, making people dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
