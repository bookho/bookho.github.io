			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing a stranger on the opposite side, the desperate woman suddenly condensed a sharp crystal ice gun and cast it to the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the power of recoil, she tried to break the car backwards and enter the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this sudden situation, she is not without doubt about the strange enemy. On the contrary, she is very puzzled and does not understand why. Someone can find the hidden secrets so quickly, which is as difficult as destroying a metropolis, or directly from Beckland to the South Continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as a sequence 4 "Desperate Witch", step by step from the "Assassin" grows up, she understands that the key moments can not be distracted, can not nonsense, all It is not too late to consider the issue afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, she chose to attack directly and wanted to take the opportunity to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been able to imagine that the ice gun has passed, the hoarfrost is condensed, the cold world, the strange woman with dark hair and black eyes is frozen in layers of crystal Inside, we must break through the obstacles and have the strength to catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, she must have left the street and mixed into the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the picture she was expecting did not appear, the crystal dream ice gun just got off the hand, and disappeared silently in the air, I don’t know where to go. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel! Desperate Witch's gaze condensed, and the black flames of the body blew up, spreading out the disease, and intending to ignite everything around and create a large-scale fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, her body trembled strangely, solidified in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw her left hand disappearing in a centimeter and a centimeter, and quickly spread upwards, difficult to contain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her eyes, the female pupils who are sluggish and opposite are dark and dark, as if they are hiding a pure darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not! You are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of the Desperate Witch stop, the whole People are like a sketch, erased by the eraser, leaving no trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her last look was full of fear and despair, her position was empty, like she had never been a man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful face, the woman with a dull expression pulled the hood of the classical robes, and the corner of the mouth moved almost undetectable, and the figure disappeared instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the outskirts of Queens, a trackless public carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry is wearing a veiled hat and sitting quietly in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not go straight to the Tsock River as others thought, fled the water, or went to the nearest railway to climb the train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She chose to return to Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this population of more than 5 million, a variety of hidden forces, a number of extraordinary mixed metropolis, can help her escape the follow-up tracking of the witch sect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, she is very nervous and always guards the terrible old housekeeper Finkel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, her head was dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the line of sight returned to normal, she found herself magically leaving the public carriage and standing next to the muddy road in the suburbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry's pupils contracted rapidly and watched for four weeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, she saw a figure wearing a classical robe and a black hood, and noticed the black eyes hidden in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, it’s like returning to infancy, and it’s so weak that there’s no resistance at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her forehead burst out of cold sweat, her legs trembled violently, but the whole person could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most terrible enemy I have ever faced... Even the high-ranking witch I have seen before, I have not given me a similar feeling... I am going to die here... I will not give up the escape operation once and for all. To be completely over... The deep sense of despair and the uncontrollable sorrow occupies the heart of Terry, making her seem to fall into the deepest and deepest nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the blue light flashed in front of her eyes, and the "curse" that could not move was removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry looked at the front again, there is no such thing as a horrible figure. Everything just like the most real illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Terry looked down, she was horrified to find that the sapphire ring of the little finger of the left hand had been torn apart and lost all the brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wreckage of 啪,啪,啪,rings and gems have fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein rolled over and rolled over the collapsed stone pillars and Mr. A, who was seriously injured and was running, went to the opposite entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the "universal key" left, the characteristics of slowly condensing, he did not look at it, so as not to be blocked by Mr. A. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very clear that he is not necessarily the opponent of the "Shepherd" when he takes the magical items and is fully prepared, not to mention the Aziz copper whistle. And three extraordinary bullets, even the match has no one left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Mr. A has been seriously injured, Klein does not dare to take risks. He heard that the "Shepherd" predecessor of the "Rose Bishop" is very good at flesh-and-blood magic. Treating the physical level of the injury is no worse than the ability to transfer the wound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吱嘎! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the heavy door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural light outside shines, the clouds in the sky are stained with thin yellowish, and the sun is pale and dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein rushed out and found that the location was in the middle of the mountain, and the peaks around it stood, making the place extremely hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, he runs wildly, not even on the mountain road, but with the help of the "clown", he goes straight down the slope, sometimes tumbling, sometimes with the help of The trees are swaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the sound of the big river, it is in front, just below! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a gale came and rolled up behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the initiative and his knees were soft and rolled toward the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was originally standing in the position and moving in the direction, and was cut into a deep gully by a wind blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mr. A fell from the wind, his body draped in a bloody cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed his hand, and there was a piece of meat flying out of it, and it swelled in the air and blasted open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A drop of blood and a little bit of meat flew, Klein stretched over, escaping most of the time, hiding behind a giant wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge trees were spattered with blood holes, and the signs of decay centered on them and quickly spread around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had just run and had a good bullet for the revolver. He was about to raise his hand and shoot Mr. A’s eyes, and he saw the other’s nephew deep. The darkness emerges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, Klein knew that although the scene around him had not changed a bit, he had been forcibly dragged into a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once killed a "nightmare", at least "nightmare"... Klein stayed awake and saw Mr. A flash in a logical way to the side, turning into The long, bloody blankets made people unable to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to rely on nightmares, directly scared my heart to stop beating? Klein’s thought flashed and he responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his dream, sober, he can simulate anything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there was a pure, dazzling golden sun in the spot, and the bright and burning flame instantly ignited everything around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's imaginary is the picture when I saw "Eternal Vigor" in the "Dream Divination"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost in no particular order, he left the dream and heard a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mr. A took a step back and had two blood flows from the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleshy robes, the surface slowly flowing, as if melting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein snapped a finger and lit the trees thirty or forty meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his feet, the weeds that had long been yellow were burned, and the flames were rushed upwards, wrapping his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mr. A is so beautiful that it’s not like a man’s face, suddenly a little more feminine, with a crystal cold and no weight ice The gun, throwing it to the burning trees dozens of meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just jumped out of the pile of flames, and the dreamy and transparent tip of the gun was reflected in the pupil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tip of the gun is getting bigger and bigger, getting clearer and clearer, occupying his entire voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slammed out and covered his body with a thin layer of hoarfrost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transparent gun immediately annihilated the flame, and the thick ice layer swiftly spread around, seeing Klein inclusive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mid-air, Klein slammed into a ball, half-turning his body and letting his head down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out his left hand and gently pressed it on the ice layer, then vacated again, out of the cold realm, but the surface skin of the palm was frozen At the contact, the thorns ripped off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting the roll, Klein will sneak into his pocket and take out the homemade "Sleep Charm". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he opened his mouth and prepared to spit out the opening spell, his nose suddenly itch and he sneezed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie! Auntie! Auntie! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a headache and sneezes, and he is unable to counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it sick? Is it infected? When Klein had a clear understanding, he felt that countless wires that were difficult to see with the naked eye rolled over and wrapped himself into a mummy in a certain sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar experience, he is no stranger, knowing that this is the extraordinary ability of "Happy Witch". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first he relied on the use of spells, so that both the enemy and the enemy fell into a sleep at the same time, and then with their special, they got rid of the control, and now, Mr. A keeps 20 The distance around the meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Klein is not just a "clown", he can also play with a finger to make a crisp sound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teng, the "spiders" around him were all ignited, as if they had turned into giant torches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just jumped out of the red, and began to sneeze, accompanied by a severe cough, many extraordinary abilities to use, so they were interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the feminine femininity of Mr. A’s face disappeared, and the extravagance of a few points was high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out his right hand and gently held it, and Klein had a hunch that he would only turn around if he ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. A, wearing a bloody robes, showed a cruel smile, and a transparent and illusory ancient book appeared in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
