			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at Kline’s eyes, Dunn took a breath, leaned back, and slowly spit out:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expression changes very little, it seems that he is prepared for the special application, but he did not expect it. Come so fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, how do you have a sigh of relief, the feeling of being down in your heart... Klein didn’t hide his smile:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm sure, Captain, when you master the potion thoroughly, you will have a special, wonderful feeling, no doubt to make sure you have mastered the potion thoroughly."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Special, wonderful feeling..." Dunn whispered the words, his brows slowly wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, the captain’s previous promotion was done without fully digesting the potion? Also, I don’t know how to “play the law”, it’s hard to completely digest... I can only rely on a long time of polishing and some subconscious play to reduce the risk of losing control... Poor captain... Klein looks at Dunn quietly. Smith, there is no opening, no supplement, let the other side think carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After nearly a minute, Dunn’s murderous ashes once again reflected Klein’s figure, and he considered the language:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, waiting for another year would be a better choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain means, wait another year, It won't be too conspicuous. Under the premise that Ms. Dai Li is a role model, the top management will not pay too much attention to me. At most, it will be included in the list of further observations. Klein thought for a moment and replied calmly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I originally wanted to wait until next year to make a special application. After all, there are still many things I need to master, for example, Fighting is just getting started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, Captain, don't you think that we have had too many coincidences in the past two months? Pursuing the kidnapping, the result is met. The notes of the Tigonus family were in the opposite room; the seal '2-049' was delayed, and Riel Bieber did not escape from Tingen. At the dock, he began to digest power; I went to a birthday. The dinner, the result led to the work of Hainas Vansente; I went to the library to investigate and met the member of the Aurora on the spot..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what these coincidences mean, but I always feel uneasy, so I want to maximize myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catch this opportunity, Klein ordered The black hand behind the scenes, this is also the arrangement he had to put on the agenda - not exposed Under special circumstances the body, to remind the nightwatchman's squad, let them find more clues from the other side, and he just those words, in the eyes of others can only conclude, keen intuition, good comb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Klein said the word "but", Dunn's body gradually leaned forward, and at the end, he had crossed his hands with his crossed hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s fading, he hasn’t spoken for a long time, and seems to be thinking about the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few dozen seconds later, Dunn raised his head and said with a low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very sharp...maybe, there is something hidden in the depths of darkness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting for Klein to speak, he turned to the command:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can write a special application."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein replied in a raised voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and got up, went to the door, and unexpectedly heard a familiar addition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute." Dunn shouted out the guy who was about to open the door, discretion, "note the words."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassured, Captain, I value this issue more than you! Klein smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the secret that has become the sequence 8 can not hold people, and will be even tired of the entire Tining City Night Club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the captain’s office, Klein has ended all mystery courses Anxious to change to the ground, slowly walked into the civilian staff room next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there is a man and a woman sitting in this office, the male is in his early thirties, and the female is in his 20s. It is the new two. member. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw Klein come in, first a glimpse, then piled up a smile, nodded and said, and curious and awe at the extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't go to chat with them, found an empty table, brushed and wrote a "special application" draft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he had a belly case, he only took ten minutes to complete the preliminary work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeated reading several times, and continuously modified a number of places, he sat in front of the Aksson 1346 mechanical typewriter, turning the draft into the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the keyboard knocking, the two new civilians glanced at each other, got up at the same time, walked out of the office, and chatted with Rosanne at the reception hall. Leave the room to Klein alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very cautious and very confidential... Klein glanced at their backs and secretly admired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He retracted his eyes and continued to tap the keyboard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was about to make a special application, Leonard Mitchell came out of the lounge, looking around, buttoning his shirt, messy hair There is a sense of beauty in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What report are you playing?" Leonard looked at the office of the civilian staff, leaning against the threshold, pointing his right foot to the ground and asking with both hands. Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His green eyes looked at Klein with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein played the last word and the last punctuation, and smiled sideways:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Special application."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Special application?" Leonard asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein picks up the paper and quickly browses it, as if casually explained:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Special application for promotion sequence 8."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough! Keke! Leonard suddenly coughed hard and calmed down for a long time, blurting out and debuting:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you digested the potion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digest? Classmates, you know a lot... Klein holds the "special application" and walks up to Leonard. The eyebrows are picking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he stared at the other person's eyes, lowered his voice, and added a sentence: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I remember who told me that there are always people in this world who are special and able to do things that others can't do.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Also like you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard was blocked and didn't know what to say. He could only change his standing position, pull his hands out of his pocket and hug his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his mouth and finally organized the language, and he asked: "You don't think so, is this too risky?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I know the digest, I definitely understand that my promotion has no risk factors... Well, he refers to the gaze of the church's tops? Klein thoughtfully Explain:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He described the things he had just said to Dunn again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard’s expression was a little bit condensed, and slightly invisible to the point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He muttered to himself: "Maybe, I have to speed up..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When the voice just fell, he suddenly looked at Klein, showing a bright smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not going to share your experience with us? Medicine, experience to avoid the risk of losing control to the maximum!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is really quick to change his face... Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am happy to share."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is planning to take advantage of today’s opportunity to mention the players of the Night Squad and lower them. The risk of getting out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, for his own safety, he can’t be too explicit in the face of Dunn Smith, at most describing the first time That is what you can let the high-level people know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That now!" Leonard couldn't wait to pull Klein to the night club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, in addition to the rotation of the Chanis Gate, the rest of Frye, Cohenri and Siga Thong are in, very leisurely play cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, everyone!" Leonard slammed the half-covered door and recited like a recital. "Let me solemnly introduce the gentleman next to me. Mr. Klein Moretti, who has mastered the potion for a month and a half!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......This guy is so exaggerated... Klein suddenly feels a little embarrassed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Miss Sika Thorn, a writer who is neither well-known nor popular, seems to be testing her own hearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leonard, don't be kidding, your performance is always so exaggerated." Cohenli reluctantly covered the cards in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frye took the card and looked at Klein for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Are you sure you have mastered the potion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Kline felt the other person's concern and nodded. "This has obvious signs. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Really?" Cohen Li screamed and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard smiled and pointed to the paper path in the hands of Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is He submitted a special application and wanted to promote the special application for Sequence 8!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...How do you do that?" Sigas Thorn thought a lot, But after taking a breath, I still only asked the question that I was most concerned about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quiet and elegant woman is difficult to control the burning of her eyes at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein found a chair and sat down with a low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am from The motto of 'The Secret Man' has been inspired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do whatever you want, but don't hurt?" Leonard was very responsible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, our internal data shows that the probability of getting out of control of the 'sneak peek' that obeys this maxim is lower than normal." Klein said from Old Neal. What I know there, "After that, I have further thoughts from Ms. Dai Li's case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Psychic' Dai Li? Cohenli asked for confirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Ms. Dai Li also submitted a special application. She only became a 'psychic' from the 'collector' in only two years. She used to Telling Neil, she wants to be a real psychic," Klein explained in detail. "With the things I experienced at the Divination Club and the corresponding feedback I received, I gradually came up with the 'Divinity Code.' ', and strictly follow it, try to be a real divination... When I did this, I found that my progress in mastering the potion became very fast, very fast, and even could not be mastered..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
