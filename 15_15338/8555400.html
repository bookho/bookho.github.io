			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. George District, Saatchi Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and Jurgen just stepped off the carriage and saw a giant behemoth at the door of the inventor Reppard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is iron black in color, with three pairs of twelve wheels, and the top is like a ship with a chimney, and the residual smoke is floating inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a steam-powered car that Klein once saw in magazines and on the streets. It is described by the public as a railway ship that is walking on land. It is quite exaggerated. Body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the street that was built or rebuilt in the last 20 or 30 years, it will occupy the road and leave no space for the carriage, so it can only be in a certain This type of transportation can only be seen in some areas of these areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the heavy door with the glass window was opened and the two figures walked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them is the steam-powered car tycoon Franmi Cage, whom Klein had seen before, and he has a quarter of the Fossac dynasty The blue color of the eyes is very light, but the body is tall but already fat, and there is a pipe in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one next to him is wearing a heavy black coat, wrapped in a gray scarf, looks nothing, is the most common black plus brown eyes, but But it gives people an inexplicable intimacy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, detective Moriarty, you are on time, this is my lawyer and partner Pacheco.Don."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, the steam-powered car came down with two brawny men with big waist and waist, and it was Frankie’s bodyguard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really unprofessional, shouldn’t you go down first and then open the door for your boss? Klein groaned, smiled and asked, and immediately introduced his lawyer, Jurgen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he waited for Repard to open the door, he casually talked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Cage, Is this steam powered car popular? Will many people like it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franmi Cage laughs:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those who think they are decent say that they are too savage and too rough, and ordinary people can't afford it, only my mechanical and steam enthusiasts are willing to buy."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main reason is that many streets are too narrow." Klein comforted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franmi Cage is the investor he is looking for, not the reward of Reppard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he played cards at the Craig Club, he intentionally mentioned this matter, and the equestrian teacher Talim immediately said that Franmi liked similar inventions and could introduce Everyone meets and knows each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Klein very emotional: the club is really a good place to develop contacts, the members who really join the most valued are never free food, drinks and event venues . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, this is really a reason. As the population grows and the city grows bigger, the carriage will definitely be eliminated because it is too slow. Now the world is pursuing efficiency!" Franmi said with confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I have already won a piece from the military Orders, they want me to make some improvements, as mentioned in the Russell manuscript, increase the armor bulletproof, cover the track so that it can also be driven on simple roads, plus a large barrel This will be a brand new war weapon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell manuscript... Klein sighed silently, shortly wondering what to say until Reppard Finally opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following discussion, the protagonists are Jürgen and Pacheco, and the two lawyers sometimes contend with each other, sometimes discussing the terms with their employers, unprepared Inventor Reppard was in a daze, and only when others asked him, he explained his opinions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Franmi will buy an 18% stake from Klein at a premium, for which he will spend 1,000 pounds and is after tax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, he will buy a 9% stake from Reppard for a post-tax price of £500. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After such a transaction, Franmi became the largest shareholder of the newly established Beckland Bike Company, occupying 47% of the shares, he will be responsible for the follow-up factory And promote sales, and the company's account will have the 1,000 pounds he invested, which is the initial start-up capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reppard is the second largest shareholder with a 43% stake in the job of assisting in the production of batch production lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has only 10% of the shares, which is a pure financial investment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the 1,000 pounds he got from selling his shares also increased his personal wealth to 2,235 pounds, almost eager to buy a "faceless person" master material. —— As a private detective, he has continued to accept commissions for more than a month, and he does not need to use deposits for his daily expenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After giving Mr. Jurgen a reward of 50 pounds, only 2,185 pounds... Thanks to the lower Talim... Klein thought, Signed the pen, stamped the seal, and then got up and shook hands with Franmi and Repard:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Happy cooperation."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franmi took a look at the gold pocket watch, hehe laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Normally, we should go with one Lunch, celebrating the agreement, but there is a big man waiting for me, I am sorry, there are still many opportunities in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big man, the big man... The one behind Tlimm? Was I reimbursed a lot of expenses with some false news pointing to the Aurora? Klein suddenly had a dim sum, and quickly smiled and said nothing, don't care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of Reppard’s home, after riding a carriage, Jurgen suddenly frowned:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock, you promised to be too refreshing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you say that?" Klein wondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t even know what the lawyer Jurgen was referring to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgen said quite seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When talking about share transfer.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to your description and the performance of Franmi, I can imagine the bright future of the bicycle. Although it is only an invention, the overall valuation will not be too high. £5,000 is a good price, but you should keep more shares so that you can make better returns in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you would only sell 8%, and have confidence to talk about 500 pounds, and you actually agreed to 18%. Even if it is only 500 pounds, you I’ve taken back the initial investment several times and shouldn’t be so anxious.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I’m in a hurry to use the money...but I just promised to be too refreshing, I’m hesitant No, this is a big amount of money. It's not like normal.... Klein recalled the scene before, and gradually got some doubts in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it unconsciously influenced by Franmi or the Pacheco lawyer? One of them is extraordinary? Fortunately, the price is still relatively normal... Klein thought about it while waiting for the answer to Jurgen:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s almost new year..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t even think about how to explain it, so I just found a beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other person is a smart person, he will follow the beginning and associate himself with the reason, and do not need Klein to describe it too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is a trick for smart people, ordinary people will ask "so what" "what is it" "what happened." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you understand? I haven't thought about it myself... Klein pointed to the steam subway station in front of it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am getting off here, I am going to find someone." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roaring, very powerful steam-powered car, Sitting in the front row, Franmi shook the window and spit a smoke ring. He said to Pacheco, who was not too eye-catching:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just Use your own ability?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just passively a little excited." Pacheco smiled. "My ability is most suitable for such a scene, I I prefer to face government employees and company employees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franmi gently sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I just reminded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this case, there is no need to use the ability, not to delay the big event. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand. Pacheco responded with a low response.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East District, a cheap coffee shop <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein arrived, Old Kohler had already waited there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took it down Scarf, take off the hat, sit opposite, pull out a stack of 1 Sule's banknotes and hand it to the other party:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next week's activity plus the news Reward, a total of 1 pound. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recently gave the rewards quite refreshingly because he has found the reimbursement object.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler's face is obviously more rosy than before, and some embarrassed to take over the cash channel:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The message I gave last time does not seem to be too important..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it doesn't matter if it's different from the eyes of you, a lot of things that you think are trivial, maybe the source of others' money. Klein smiled and explained, "What's the situation this week?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Collet took the stack of banknotes and stuffed it into his pocket, thinking and thinking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "As before, many people are still looking for 'fool' believers, haha, how can someone believe in 'fool'? This is not a good name. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein’s mouth twitched slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do they have progress?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora will be really persevering... Klein has no choice but to think.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, There are no such people at all. Old Kohler shook his head and said, "Someone has been organizing a strike recently. I have been looking for me several times, saying that I want to get more reasonable working hours and salary." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This era is a normal thing, but it can lead to quite serious consequences... Klein said thoughtfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You pay attention to who is organizing this matter, but don't be too eager, safety first. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. "Old Kohler cleared his throat and said, "Many gangsters and bounty hunters are looking for a person these days. I don't know why, who should have given a reward." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you looking for? Klein felt the weather was cold and took a sip of coffee.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm liquid slipped over his esophagus and warmed the stomach.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
