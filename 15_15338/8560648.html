			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the house, Klein first saw a foyer, which is very spacious, with many chairs and umbrella stands, and is elegantly furnished and well decorated, if not Knowing the structure in advance and investigating it in the field, Klein would even think that this is a waiting room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the second door, he was cheerful and cheerful, and there was a hall where tens of hundreds of guests could dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the hall is covered with colorful thick and soft carpets, surrounded by bright and clear marble tiles, with piano, stone carvings and other items, and a support The stone pillars inlaid with ornaments are supported on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left side of the floor is a row of floor-to-ceiling windows, outside is the green lawn and the garden, the right side has walls, wooden doors and corridors, leading to the lounge. Storage rooms, washrooms, kitchens and butler rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is up to two floors, with crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, letting people imagine the way after the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the end, there are stairs on both sides leading to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloister here is square, and the part that is vacant in the center is exactly where the hall is carpeted. Klein just takes a glass of wine and stands on the second floor railing. You can enjoy the dance below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor has a large number of rooms, living room, living room, dining room, washroom, billiard room, plenty of bedrooms, if guests need to stay, Will live here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, there are two stairs on the second floor leading to the third floor, where Donne Dontes lived, with an exaggerated master bedroom. There is a semi-open room with a bar that can be sun-baked to enjoy the scenery. There is a study room called a small library. There are two cloakrooms and a close-fitting servant, a small bedroom for the night maid, and a room for family members and a bathroom. But Klein is currently single. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for other servants, in the row of bungalows behind the building, the other direction is the stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground part of the building is equally spacious with a large storage room and wine cellar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein taking off his jacket, standing straight on the large balcony on the third floor and half open room, overlooking the scenery of the surrounding neighborhood, could not help I sighed in my heart: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still a valuable meaning, the £315 rent is not too wasteful..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paid a one-year rent yesterday afternoon and can only force himself to be more pleasing to the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he also paid Walter a salary of 115 pounds a year, because he succeeded after taking the Antignus family notes. Escaped, and even the housekeeper was unemployed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this philosophy, he also paid the annual salary of the female butler Tanahya for 42 pounds this morning, so that the lady initially felt the Tao. Tang Tai Mr. Si’s shots are generous and human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the discussion and busyness of the two butlers, the servants have been hired, a male family property manager with an annual salary of 30 pounds, a personal servant Richardson earns 35 pounds a year. The two men’s servants who are responsible for receiving the guests at the table are paid 25 pounds a year. The two first-class maids each have an annual salary of 18 pounds. The two second-class maids each have an annual salary of 12 pounds. Two crude servants. The annual salary is also 12 pounds each. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these, the chef earns 30 pounds a year, kitchen assistant 15 pounds, kitchen maid 13 pounds, storeroom maid 11 pounds, family nurse 25 pounds, small workers 10 pounds, Two coachmen each have 25 pounds, two gardeners each have 20 pounds, and two washing maids each have 10 pounds, for a total of 413 pounds, almost 8 pounds per week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recounting the annual salary of the two butlers, Klein pays 570 pounds a year, about 11 pounds a week, which is not yet food, clothes, and Expenditure on daily necessities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes every week, if you have no income, you have to spend ten or twenty pounds... Klein is mentally minded and forced to look Move to the garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how long the 1000 pounds in Tanaia can support. It is only a few hundred pounds to store enough alcoholic drinks for the ballroom. Mr. Donn. Dontes is immersed in contemplation. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to calm his emotions, he decided to take care of the housekeeper and the servants to handle the new home affairs, and go around the fog to study Emlin. The weird puppet that Wright sacrificed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——After the bloody month, Klein had to return to the mysterious space, pull Firth in, and endure sleepiness to listen to each other. Rand's daily life, when everything subsided, he was too sleepy. After accepting the sacrifice of Emlin and confirming that there was no abnormality, he returned to the real world and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the line of dark vests, Klein walked to the entrance, opened the door, and stood outside the housekeeper Richardson Road :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am used to taking a nap at this time for three quarters of an hour, don't let anyone bother me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Okay, sir." Richardson responded humbly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a mixed-blood illegitimate child, his father is a Lun, a manor, and his mother is a native of East Byron, a slave to the manor. After he was born, he was discriminated against and bullied, and he developed a character of cowardly obedience, because the appearance was quite good, suitable for receiving guests, and was chosen by the owner of the manor as a male servant and brought to Beckland. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the two houses of the Kingdom of Lun passed the bill to abolish slavery, he was unemployed and had to ask for assistance from the Metropolitan Helping Family Servant Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Klein, he served two families, made some mistakes, accumulated a lot of experience, and was taken care of by butler Walter. En. Tangtes's personal servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the tall and straight, Richardson, who is almost as tall as he is now, Klein shook his head invisibly and sighed in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of guy who can be a star in appearance can only be a servant in this era, and obviously grows so tall, but timid and weak, but this It is also an advantage, obedience, silence, obedience, what the master told him to do, and absolutely does not make his own claim...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I only have a personal servant, I need him. Dealing with all kinds of things, Richardson is definitely not qualified, but I still have Walter Butler, and there are so many servants, the rest of the things, with his experience and ability, enough to cope. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not much to say, Klein closed the door and locked back, back to the easy chair, and took four steps back and entered the fog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat down to the position of "fool" and took a hand to let the "moon puppet", which was all over the body, fly over and fall to the front.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After repeated examinations, Klein did not find a specific place, so he wrote a pen and wrote the divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Its origins. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the pen, Klein waited for a few seconds before picking up the paper and leaning back against the back of the chair.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, spiritual instinct did not stop me from divination, which shows that the danger of the "moon puppet" hidden is not as great as the rose school's extraordinary character... Klein sighed and skillfully recited the divination statement.<br />< Br /> /> </ br> </ br> The things that are suspected of human skin are full of bloody traces. There are three candles in the center and several dolls that are slender like wooden stakes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These small The puppet's eyes are bent and the mouth is bent, which seems to correspond to the sky's blushing new moon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, they always have a weird smile, and the body is inlaid with grass and Dried flowers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A priest wearing a dark red robe is struggling around the altar, just like jumping an epileptic . & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp dance invention <br <br /> & nbsp />;</div>
