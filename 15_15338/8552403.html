			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deep and quiet underground corridor, the nearly four-meter white bone messenger handcuff paper disappeared in front of Klein and did not cause any abnormal changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there were only elegant gas lamps embedded in the wall, he took the Aziz copper whistle and continued to the Chanis Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of writing a letter, he has already thought about which seal to choose next:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, the "3" seal is almost impossible to affect the baby in the belly of Megaco, except for the hidden mystery of the "variant sun emblem." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, this situation, Klein has a mind to know how to have time to explore or study secrets that may or may not exist, plus Seals are more or less hidden, causing great inconvenience and even danger to users. Therefore, Klein directly excludes the "3" seals that can not affect the enemy and weaken themselves. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Tining City Night Club has no "1" seals, and the "2" level has only three, which is what Klein should not know. Secret, but in view of the critical situation, Dunn decisively used the "emergency clause" to tell him the general situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Down Smith couldn’t pick up another seal while mastering the ashes of St. Serena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "2" seals behind the Chanis Gate in Tingen are: "2-030", "2-078" and "2-105" ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of "2-030" is "the poison that never burns out", from an extraordinary person who suddenly goes crazy and whose serial name is unknown. He cuts himself off. The suicide of the wrist caused the blood in the body to flow into a small ordinary silver cup. However, when he shed the blood, the silver cup was not filled, and the liquid inside became crystal and moist, which was extraordinarily attractive, even with sequence 5. The extraordinary can't resist this temptation, drank this cup of liquid, and was poisoned on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the poisoned person dies, the venom will squirt out from the pores of his skin and reunite together, compared with the beginning, not much less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den said that the researchers in the church suspect that the high sequence strong will die, but the problem is that the high sequence strong will hardly be the cup. Poisoning temptation, and because the "2-030" features are obvious, it is impossible to misuse them. To poison them, they must first arrest them, firmly control them, and force them to pour, but why bother? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2-030" will continue to entice the surrounding creatures to drink it, users must concentrate on countering this power, a little lax, it will be like a habit Drink the poison in your hands as you move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost as Dunn described it, Klein had decided not to pick this seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2-078" is called the "gate of death", its shape is a normal wooden door, and all creatures passing through it will die directly. Those with high sequence strength did not participate in the test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a living character that will always try to escape, and can change shape, disguise as the original door, if the user makes a mistake, let it break away With control, you must be careful not to pass through any door around you, try to stay where you are waiting for the rescue, or just break the wall and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has considered using "2-078", but after repeated trade-offs, the intuition of mythological creatures must be very sensitive, and it should be able to tell which one is "death." The door, so the actual combat effect of this seal will not be too good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he decided to pick "2-105". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of this seal is "vascular thief", its shape is a large, rigid blood vessel, anyone who touches it, no matter Without protection, you will be stolen from life. It is not obvious at first, but if you don’t get out of touch, you will have a corresponding external performance after half an hour. Dunn said that a sequence 5 cultist supports For two hours, from the thirties in the thirties to the aging, the skin is loose, the hair is white and sparse, and the teeth are all fading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest feature of "2-105" is that the person wearing it has the ability to steal a certain target within a certain range, and the high sequence is also strong. Will be stolen, but the chances are small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten minutes of the seal's ability taking effect, the stolen person will directly lose the corresponding ability, and the wearer can use it skillfully. After ten minutes, the ability disappears and the stolen person will wait until the next day to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether it works, at least the probability of winning is increased from 5 percent to 10 percent, and I am also the king of yellow and black who is in charge of good luck... ... Again, our main purpose is to prevent problems before they happen, to make the worst plans, not necessarily to do it... I hope the helpers will arrive as soon as possible..." Klein stopped at the outside and no longer hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not worried about the negative impact of the seal "2-105" because he does not intend to use it himself...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His plan is for Leonard, who himself has a "yangyan spell" and "Azick copper whistle" that does not know whether it will be suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poet classmates, it’s time to show your true secrets... Klein whispers and sees Siga Thorn standing at the door of the duty room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This white-haired, sturdy, part-time writer has been silent for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You look at the Chanis Gate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My strength is stronger than you, my experience is more abundant than you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you don't have a "yangyan spell"... Klein smiled and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms. I have sequence 8. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even if it is here, it will not be safe. The seals with alive characteristics behind the door of Chanis may be just around the corner. Well, if we fail, we are The people here are certainly not immune."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, our goal above is to delay the time and wait for the rescue, which may be safer than near the Chanis Gate. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siece. Tern slowly licked his lower lip and solemnly drew a red moon on his chest:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May Goddess bless you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Dunn had no time to write a document, Klein couldn’t go directly to the Chanis Gate, only to watch Siga Thorn push a gap and flash into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, her figure appeared at the door, holding a pale blood-stained blood vessel in her left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took over and suddenly felt that there was a weak current in his body that washed over and over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reception hall of the Black Thorny Security Company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard has got rid of the rigid state just now, and the expression no longer has a strange saying about the newly discovered house rented by Llanus. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? He never told me..." Mei Gaoousi frowned slightly and made a fairly normal answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she grabbed her blond hair and grabbed it, and threw it into the trash can next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard stayed for a while, swallowed a hard mouth, and had a cold sweat in his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein on the left hand wrapped around the "blood thief", along the stairs Step by step back to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the blue gas lamp, at the door of the night lounge, Dunn Smith wearing a black knee-length trench coat stood quietly here. The eyes are dark and dark, as he did when he first met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Re-recognize, the night, Dunn Smith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past sound flashes In Klein's ear, his mind suddenly highlighted Dunn, who was half a squat beside Cohenli's body, highlighting the other's mouth full of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He silently walked for a few seconds and lifted his left hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
