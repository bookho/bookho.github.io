			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the outskirts of the North End, a three-story house that was abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This originally belonged to the Beckland Medical School, but the latter’s main body has now moved to a better and more suitable place, leaving only a small number of teaching staff and the current Students who failed to graduate successfully "guarded" local. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey wearing a white coat, face mask with the same color, moisturizing blonde hair was also smothered into the cold color of the surgical cap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her eyes and looked at the same dress, Folswell, who always felt that the other person had a special temperament and seemed to be more suitable than herself. The costumes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount...that is the kind of temperament that can pick up the scalpel and cut the patient’s stomach at any time... Audrey did not speak, followed by half a step in Foll I walked into the classroom in front of me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the feedback from Fols, she was shocked because Mr. Fool said that it was a simple task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering simplicity may be just relative to Mr. Fool’s own, Audrey’s chance to disguise himself, mourn his name, whisper and pray After the original report was reported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she has not received a response so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the gate, enter the room, Audrey instinct first took a look around and found that this is not an ordinary classroom, there are four bone specimens and Four coffins made of glass, the coffin is filled with preservatives, soaking four naked bodies with pale skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the classroom, there is also a transparent glass column, which is also filled with liquid, floating a male body wearing a black bachelor suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clothes of this corpse are tightly attached to the body, giving a very heavy feeling. He does not fall down, so he rises vertically in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like living and dying inside, not putting it in after death... Audrey made a preliminary judgment with the attitude of the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, she saw the people in the room’s long strips sitting around with a few white masks and white caps. They didn’t say a word. , like the surrounding corpses and bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the end of the blushing moon and the dark night, Audrey returned to the classroom, and couldn’t help but shudder. Here comes from the instinct of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the same, she feels excited and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the life that an extraordinary person should have... Audrey silently sighed and sat down with Foss looking for a corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a while, in the vertical glass column at the forefront of the classroom, the floating male body wearing a black bachelor’s suit suddenly opened his eyes and let the voice pass through Obstacles are heard: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Begin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East District, Dalavi Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is wearing a dusty gray-blue worker's uniform, wearing a cap, walking on a gas streetlight, only a few miles still in the dark streets on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In each apartment on both sides, some candlelight is sprinkled, which is intertwined with the blushing moonlight that penetrates the clouds, and barely outlines the pedestrians. profile. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein met one by one old and tattered clothes, with numbness and desperate passers-by, who were driven by the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have no place to sleep, they can only walk aimlessly on the streets, occasionally catching opportunities, looking for an unobtrusive corner or in the park The street chair rests for a while, but will soon be blasted away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cold and deep night, Klein thinks they are more like living corpses than the living corpses they have seen, and the entire Eastern District is more abyss than the myths and legends. Like the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed in a hurry, and the throat was stimulated. He couldn't help but cough twice, busy converging his thoughts, and looking at the apartment at the corner with the corner of his eye, there was an apartment that had obviously exploded and had not been repaired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To monitor the crime scene, the best and most hidden place is the other apartment that is facing, the third, fourth and roof Asked..." Klein analyzed the situation with the knowledge he had learned in the Night Squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole process, he did not slow down, lest he be suspected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the entrance to the street, Klein smoothly crossed the apartment with the number 1 and entered the building opposite the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar place, he is no stranger, the one bedroom he rented in the East District is located in a similar apartment, and when he was in Tingen, he And my brother Benson, my sister Melissa, also lived in a long-awaited apartment with only a little higher grades - this is both Klein's personal experience and the memory of the original Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the thoughts, Klein pulled the cap down and buried his head. He stepped on the creaking stairs and walked all the way to the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the unfortunate experience in the evening, he does not have a revolver now, he can only insert his hand into his pocket and hold a few tarot cards with his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the lights, only a little moonlight in the third floor aisle, Klein did not hurry to move forward, carefully observed the layout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right side of the scene is the left side, the best view of the surveillance field should be the third room in the past... Klein began to carefully move slowly Forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After walking through two rooms, his right hand was also inserted into his pocket and lightly opened the iron cigarette case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the moment, his finger touched the "all-black eye", and the ear slammed the slang of tearing the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, with this contaminated item, Klein saw a black, weird thin line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These thin lines are floating in the void, although there is a certain interlacing and a little entanglement, but looking back, we can still distinguish who they belong to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corresponding figure is reflected in the brain that Klein is about to be cooked, there are men and women sleeping in the bed, and there are several renters lying on the floor. customer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, there are no special places and no hidden characters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is busy retreating, not directly touching the "black eye", the illusion in front of him and the auditory hallucination of the ear is slow Slowly getting better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He endured the pain, continued on, slightly relieved, and immediately observed another room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, he "searched" the entire apartment to see the opposite scene of the crime scene, there is no gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, call... Klein shrunk into the corner of the balcony, his hands on his knees, and he gasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was tears in his eyes, and his nose snorted from time to time, just like a sudden onset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the result of frequent contact with the "All Black Eyes" in a short period of time. With Kline's resistance in this respect, it is not completely immune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that satisfied him was that it was just a stimulus, not a pollution, otherwise he would give up long ago and would not dare to try again, which would lead directly to madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a break, Klein finally calmed down the reaction and changed the apartment without a good apartment, but still did not gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is my interpretation wrong? The clue is on the scene of the crime? Klein returned to the street and looked at the apartment with the blast marks with a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a casual attitude, he inserted his hand into his pocket and opened it and explored it in an iron cigarette case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to see where the entry is found in the apartment, whether there is a person hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
