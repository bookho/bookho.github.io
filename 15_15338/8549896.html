Didn’t Dunn tell you the esoteric esoteric? Do whatever you want, but don’t hurt!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although this maxim was first transmitted from a secret, evil organization, the Moss ascetic society, the extraordinary people who chose the path of the 'sneak peek' proved their own experience. It's correct, as long as it is strictly observed and full of awe, the risk of losing control will be minimized, and the opposite inference is also true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your suspicion is right I, the insult to the sneak peek!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry." Klein did not hesitate to apologize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did forget the maxim that Dunn Smith once mentioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil is not really angry, and he smiles in a blink of an eye: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, There are too few extraordinary people to choose 'Divination' and there is no corresponding maxim to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have the diary of Russell the Great... well, strict Obeying the motto itself has the taste of "playing"... Klein suddenly associates, as if he is thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil did not say more, took the vases and other things on the heavy round table and put them in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he took out a red and dark candle from the silver crate and explained it with his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If ordinary people want to try ritual magic, they must choose the appropriate date based on the astrological result or flip through the corresponding manual, such as the Sunday symbolizing the goddess, such as the moon that he dominates. But for our extraordinary, especially those who are good at this, these are not needed, our vigorous spirituality, our powerful astral body is the most crucial element."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, if you are not sure about the ritual magic you want to try, then pick the right date, the right time, can effectively improve the success rate."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, there is a premise, you must keep in mind, and strictly abide by!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil put two candles, sideways The body, looking at Klein, said very seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The low sequence itself is still Enough, all the ritual magic that can be carried out is to pray for strength and ask for help. Therefore, only the orthodox gods such as the goddess and the storm master can be considered. Absolutely, never try to communicate an unknown and unpredictable existence, even if it is Some people believe in them, even if the promises recorded are full of temptation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trust me, don't have a lucky attitude, as long as you try it once, you will inevitably The ground slides into the abyss, all efforts, all resistance, can only delay the speed, can not reverse the trend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will remember!" Klein Shen The voice answered, but my heart was faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Own "transportation ceremony" seems to be praying for an unknown, unpredictable existence...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;And really got the power that makes the "extraordinary" veteran extraordinary incredible force, pulling them into the fog, um, he should be a veteran extraordinary person...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worried about this matter, he took the initiative to transfer the topic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, the nights are better to ask the goddess for help?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to pray for the Lord of the Storm, there will be no one to stop you, but He may not respond, or will respond with malicious intent, which will distort the results of our ritual magic to unpredictable The direction." Old Neil succeeded in dispelling Klein's luck with a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as "best", only "must"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When done, Old Neil picked up the red-red candle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Candles made of moon flowers, crimson sandalwood, etc., symbolize the blushing identity of the goddess in ritual magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the dark black candle :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The candles made by night vanilla, deep sleep flowers, etc., symbolize the night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak In the meantime, he placed the black one on the top left of the round table and the red one on the upper right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is there only two candles that symbolize the goddess, He is still the mother of mystery, the Queen of Evil and fear, the sleeping and the silent lord."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, this is the question I want you to ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before no fall, the relationship between the Morse Penances and the Church is very good, and some of their ideas and achievements in ritual magic have deeply affected us." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They think that everything is equal, every number has spirituality, and in ritual magic, 0 stands for unknown, representing chaos, symbolizing the state before the birth of the world, 1 The beginning, representing the original Creator, 2 symbolizes the world born from Him and the gods, 3 means that the gods are in contact with matter, everything is formed, here, with two candles symbolizing the goddess, leaving the third to ourselves." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which two candles are used, which two symbols are to be based on ritual magic The effect that you want to achieve is determined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three things? Everything is three? Klein couldn't help but think of something that he had touched in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See him listen carefully, Old Neil holds the third candle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is a candle that symbolizes 'I', a very ordinary candle, just add a little mint, remember that plants such as roses, lemons, mints, moonflowers, night vanilla and deep sleep flowers are loved and favored by the goddess."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three candles, on the other hand, also symbolize the physical, spiritual and divine nature of each individual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After the description, the old Neil placed the third root in the center of the round table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has successively taken out the modulated "Full Moon Essential Oil", and a large kettle with a dark emblem, a silver knife with a gorgeous pattern, a glass of water, A dish of coarse salt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the extraordinary who are not good at ritual magic, this time you need bells, crystal balls, silver cups, incense and other items to assist, but voyeur and The divination is not needed, these utensils are enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil puts the billed parchment paper next to the big kettle directly below, and uses special feathers The pen presses a corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is sideways to Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ritual magic needs a clean, no one bother The spiritual environment, which must be created by ourselves, by first entering meditation, accumulating the spirit, and then guiding our forces out by auxiliary objects, built around, like I used to live at Riel Bieber' Halloween powder', such as the ritual silver plaque I am going to use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the whole process, we must determine the symbol and corresponding mantra according to the desired result. The mantra is best to use Hermes, because the ancient Hermes language comes from nature, similar to the ancient dragon language, the ancient Elvish language, the effect is very direct, lacking the necessary concealment and protection, easy to put the user into danger, which is it The reason for the improvement, however, it is indeed more effective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein stepped back two steps and looked at Daniel intently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil’s eyes quickly turned deep, and invisible winds began to swirl around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He silently, in order from left to right, from top to bottom, using the spirit and material friction, in turn ignited three candles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he picked up the silver knife, inserted it into the coarse salt, and sang the spell written in Hemys:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I sanctify you, the blade of sterling silver!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I clean and purify you, let you be in the ceremony Serve me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of the goddess of the night, the lord of blush, "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are sanctified!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short, powerful old word, Old Neil pulled out a silver knife, inserted it into the glass of water, and then lifted it up, pointing to the space outside the round table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed the outer ring with the tip of the knife, then took the pace and walked around the round table. Every step, Klein could feel the invisible power from the silver. The knives are sprayed out of the air. They are full of spirituality and are connected to the air to form a wall of sealing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a lap, the altar was isolated from the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil stands in front of the round table, puts down the silver knife and picks up the bottle of "full moon oil", which goes to black, deep red and ordinary candles. Three drops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint mist is filled, and everything seems to be mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil put down the glass bottle, looked at the parchment paper, silenced for two minutes, then took the quill and painted the control on the "bill" The symbol - a square that frames all the content, indicating that it controls the debt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he drew a "fork" to indicate elimination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here, he took the parchment in one hand and tapped his eyebrows in one hand to open the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an invisible and energetic glow, and Old Neil whispers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I pray for the power of the night;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for the power of blush;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Pray for the goddess' care;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call for the payment of this bill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Night vanilla, a herb belonging to the Red Moon, please pass the power to my mantra!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The moon flower, the herb belonging to the Red Moon, Please pass the power to my curse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is listening I’m so stunned, my thoughts are stirring up each other:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does such a spell work? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was written and read in Hermes...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too much too Is it too plain and too grounded? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the goddess be angry and double the bill? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the candle shines brightly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Nelson finished chanting, closed his eyes for two minutes, picked up the "full moon oil", and dropped a drop on each of the three candles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
