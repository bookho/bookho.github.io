			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end... At the moment of the deal, Klein quietly sighed and felt that the pressure on his body had eased a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the messenger said that the 10,000 pieces of Luen gold coins can be repaid in installments, and did not stipulate when to start, but Klein still does not want to drag too long, afraid to provoke Angry Renee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a semi-god-level spiritual creature. As long as it is really angry, even if there is a contract, she also has a way to "employer"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cost of playing the rich is really too big, the salaries and corresponding expenses of the twenty servants are only a small part of them, the next carriage, horses, drinks The gift of sending neighbors, the expenditure of the ball, the investment of disguising identity is just as much, and there is not much cash to reserve. I am really afraid that it will be difficult to continue when it goes bankrupt...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;哎, 6,500 pounds plus the original money, enough to support the target? No, these two days of experience tell me that I should never use my own insight to imagine the rich man’s life. There should be a five or six thousand pounds to be able to maintain it... Klein wants to raise his hand and rub the temple, but in the end it is forbearance. Lived this impulse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He packed his mind and let the "world" look around again, hoarse and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The second item is the 'biotoxin bottle'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He described the brown translucent glass vial in a relatively simple language, with emphasis on The characteristics of several toxins, the time of entry into force, the precautionary approach and the negative effects of being carried around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey heard that the spine was cold and slightly embarrassed, the former is because of the ability to grab their skin and flesh and blood. Terrible toxins, the latter is due to the wide range of strange aphrodisiacs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a crazy magic item... Hey, it’s a type that must be prepared in advance to function effectively, for the average “audience” It’s quite awkward, because observation and reading can help the low-sequences of this route to detect danger in advance and respond...but I don’t have to, if I notice the danger ahead, I can call the protector directly... and The effect is not what I like! It is also easy to harm yourself! Audrey, you are already an extraordinary person of mature reason, can't see anything to buy! Audrey seriously thought for a few seconds and gave up the idea of ​​asking the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that "Justice" did not speak, Klein couldn't help but make the "world" add one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"5200 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey teeth bite the inside of the lower lip and politely shook his head:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to get more amazing offensive items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The audience" is also a lack of positive attack in the early stage Only good at influencing and controlling the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"5200 pounds." "Inverted" Alger, "Magic" Firth, "Moon" Emlin also whispered the price at the same time. There is no more superfluous thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"5200 pounds... "The hidden person" Jia Delia did not know what to think, obviously paused, and then quickly added, "For me, no necessary. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The "hidden" lady seems to be afraid of something... "Justice" Audrey sharply read the other's emotions.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that moment, Jia De Li Ya first felt that the "biotoxin bottle" and "toxin expert" Frank Lee fit together, and the ability is not too overlapping, there are complementary places, thinking about whether to help He bought it from his own family. Anyway, he also squandered a lot of money. He immediately considered that Frank Lee had obtained a "biotoxin bottle" and he did not know what a terrible experiment he would do. He inexplicably shuddered and gave up the initial Ideas.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t want to see the children of the crew on the deck of the future, or the kind of barking.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the party, I wrote a letter to Miss Sharon and told her that the necklace of "Blood on the Blood" was sold out, leaving only the "biotoxin bottle"... Klein disguised I was disappointed in my heart, thinking about it and letting the "world" open:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The price is £1,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge is equal to money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the "fool", "downside" and other members of the psychological alchemy club, "justice" Audrey has been heart-warming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She now has a very solid foundation of occultism and is eager for advanced content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the psychological alchemy club should also teach me some high-level occult knowledge, but certainly not very comprehensive, limited to the spiritual field... Audrey simple Convince yourself, nodded slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly what I want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Magic" Firth is also very interested, think about the money, and silently closed his mouth, as for other members, there is no lack of similar knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a "just" lady, there is no counter-offer, my bottom line is actually only 800 pounds, no, there is no bottom line, knowledge is not only Selling once... Klein feels happy and makes the "world" laugh: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "However, I must remind you that you should never pray to the 'primitive moon', which will make you become a creepy piece of meat that mates with different species and gives birth to various children. Of course, it cannot be hidden to other secrets. Praying, this is equally dangerous. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey heard a moment of fear and couldn't help but change the sitting position.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She immediately calmed down, looking to the top of the bronze long table, firmly said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When holding a secret ceremony, I only prayed to Mr. 'fool'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is sincere and has no trace of falsehood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss justice" to " The Fool is really admired and believes... Klein’s inexplicable feelings are a bit embarrassing, because the field of “Poseidon Scepter” does not overlap with the “primitive moon”. In some rituals, he cannot complete the most effective response. I can only try to mobilize a little power feedback from this mysterious space above the fog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as a "fool", he expressed his attitude: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he made the initial goal, let the "world" casually say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I also have an extraordinary feature of the 'interrogator' here, as long as 1200 pounds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... How many items did he have... "Magic" Firth was shocked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that the money for Hugh is still quite a lot, and lacks the corresponding formula, she can only regain her gaze and pretend not to hear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for The "interrogator" of Mr. Fool's subordinates has extraordinary characteristics. She does not think that the other party will keep it for herself for so long.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See no response, "world" cough One channel:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not traded. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice just fell, waiting for the "downside down" Alger looked at the "hidden" Jia De Li Yadao:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to know where there are Orbnis sea monsters that don't belong to the Storm Church. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Obutnis Sea Monsters that are not part of the Storm Church? Isn't it really a member of the Storm Church? The "Hidden" Jia Delia's brow Wrinkled a bit, and then stretched out: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will help you inquire about it, and then talk about the price after having the exact clue. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene was silent for a few seconds. "Moon" Emlin saw it, and "Magician" Foer said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The £100 clue fee, I will give it to you today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." "Magic" Firth is not very emotional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transaction of Mr. "World" was just a thousand pounds, ten thousand pounds, which made her a bit numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moon" Emlin turned his head to look at the "Sun" Dairik:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The roots and auxiliaries of the tree of the elders you want are all there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You give me a list of which monsters around the Silver City, I Pick a few items of comparable value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, they cost me a total of £2,000, plus my remuneration of £200, for a total of £2,200.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin only wants to switch to something that can be quickly removed, otherwise he will have no money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, amount, thank you, Mr. Moon." "Sun" Dairik’s heart was a joy, and suddenly he felt that "Moon" did not seem to be So annoying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly presented the corresponding list and handed it to the "Moon" Emlin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin looked at the papers at random, looked at them, and suddenly felt wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is only the information itself, it has a high value, reflecting the details and resources of the area around Silver City! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, they seem to have read the list without paying... "Moon" Emlin couldn’t help but aim at "downside down" Alger and the "hidden" Jia Delia have a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, he seems to understand something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the "sun", Emlin has both a new sense of superiority and a guilty conscience that cannot be eliminated, clearing his throat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This, this, and this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik remembers carefully Down, you don't have to go back to Silver City, you can get enough of these items around the town in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, "Justice" Audrey asked the clues of the psychedelic bell tree fruit and got the answer that disappointed her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transaction ends here, without the "fool" Klein announced that they took the initiative to enter the free exchange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""""""" Still in the afternoon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but will return to Silver City, the new exploration team has arrived today." "Sun" Dairik is not only serious Answering the question of Mr. "Down Hanging Man", he also took the initiative to mention, "I have already told the 'Chief' that I got the 'Notary' potion formula in the process of clearing the monsters in the afternoon town."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“倒吊人” gently sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What is his attitude?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He only said 'very good'." "Sun" Dairik recalled the situation at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Inverted Man” Alger heard a low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You You can rest assured that your 'chief' will be happy to see you grow up. In comparison, he will be more wary of the 'Shepherd' elder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He did not continue this topic and instead sent a message to all members:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
