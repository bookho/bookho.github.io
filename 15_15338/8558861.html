			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the words of Amyrius Levitt, not a question, Bilt’s forehead instantly burst into a dense cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his mouth as if he wanted to defend something, but in the end he slammed his knees and shuddered in the indescribable pressure: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Admiral, Admiral, the former tramp died of sudden illness, I had to find a new adventurer who could change."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Klein is not too nervous, because Admiral Levitte Levitt has noticed himself in the banquet hall, and it is unreasonable to recognize it now. It is extraordinary. He is also willing to meet rather than directly avoiding risks, indicating that he is not too concerned about who Bilt is looking for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not at all worried? This is the confidence of the demigod, or his extraordinary way to eliminate hidden dangers in advance... Klein struggled to raise his head and turned his eyes to the admiral who had already turned his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strong strength." Amyrius Levitt commented without expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still looks at Bill's knees on one knee:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't try to be at me Playing with the cleverness of those who can't get on the table.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The position of ordinary people and extraordinary people in this world is different, and I am in order The practitioner can clearly confirm this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, consistent with the description on the information, this general has a tendency to preach, I have to keep this in mind, this is with myself. In a different style from that of German Sparrow... Kline thoughtfully took his eyes back and cast it on the ground, as if he couldn't bear the pressure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Amyrius Levitt took a step forward: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Deception is the first mistake you made, and the second is not careful." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The tramp that has spent a lot of energy suddenly dies, and then an adventurer who can change looks in front of you. You don't think this is too coincidental. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it’s a bit clever... Klein almost repeated the other side’s question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t confirmed on the fog, he wondered if he was arranged by any mythological creature or “0” seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilter heard the pupils shrink and wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that he had just wanted to catch the last lifebuoy because of fear and fear, completely lost the cautiousness of experience, and never thought about Geer. Is it too coincidental that Man Sparrow's appearance is coming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time he went to the "sweet lemon" bar, the tramp was suddenly dying! The more Bilt thinks, the more he feels that he has fallen into a well-planned trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amyrius Levitt sees Bilt’s face changing again and again, and it’s a remorse and a sigh of relief:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My father, the old Earl of Levitt, who has passed away, once taught me a word.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said, forgive your men The first mistake made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bilter, you want to thank him for his kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilter's tense spirit A little ease, but inexplicably had a strong touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that Amyrius Levitt, who is closer to God than humans, will execute himself on the spot to warn all adventurers who secretly work for him. Who knows, the other party has chosen forgiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Admiral, I, I..." Bilt did not speak for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amyrius maintains a serious attitude, said in a deep voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The words just now In the latter part, it is 'severely punish their second mistakes', Bilt, do you know what to do in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilt, who was kneeling on one knee, immediately straightened his back and held his right fist to the left chest: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only loyalty to the Lord!"<br />< Br /> /> </ /> </ br> /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It depends on which identity you are asking... Klein vomits in his heart and calmly replies:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"German Sparo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amyrius Levitt suddenly quiet for two seconds, the atmosphere in the utility room seems to solidify . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Klein couldn’t help but feel a little uneasy, Amyrius finally opened:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It turned out to be you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admiral, you are like knowing me, I am an ordinary military informant, only through you After receiving the bounty, I haven’t had time to reimburse anything... Klein secretly swears two sentences, the more I think, the more my heart is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amyrius has nosed his head, compared to Bilter and Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The plan is as usual Carry out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you need to sign a contract. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contract? Klein struggled against the majesty and looked up to Amyrius.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Admiral Amyrius did not explain anything. He picked up the paper and pen that had been prepared and placed on the window sill, and brushed it up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Every time I drop a pen, it seems that there is a golden glow, and the scene is solemnly sacred like drafting a law.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gradually narrows his eyes and begins to look away Blurred, couldn't help but lower his head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how long ago, Amyrius stopped the pen and picked up the sheet of paper, saying to Klein: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sign your name at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the terms are not satisfactory, you can not sign."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think I dare, or not? dare? Klein groaned, watching Bilt get up, took the pen and handed it to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms on the paper are very simple, only a few, which roughly constrains the behavior of German Sparrow playing Amyrius Levitt. , including but not limited to, unable to actively expose the problem, can not use the identity of the general to do things that are not conducive to Amyrius himself, can not have too close contact with Miss Cynthia, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that this big man wouldn’t care too much about the chastity of the mistress... This admiral is really an old man... but I am not that kind of person. ... Klein hides curiosity and asks like an academic question: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Miss Cynthia wants to have close contact with me?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His subtext is too alienated and resistant to being easily seen by Cynthia, asking how to grasp a degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter." Amyrius said with no expression. "You have no desire when you face her, or the body lacks the necessary ability." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can it still be like this? This contract is a bit powerful... In addition to the contract with the spiritual creatures, I was the first to see other contracts, and the former had to borrow the power of the underworld. This contract was only for the parties to the transaction... This is Admiral Amyrius. The semi-divine level extraordinary ability? What is the "arbitrator" approach? Klein took aim at the expiration date and found it to be five days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is he confident that he will come back within five days, or is his current personality only allowed the contract to last for five days? Klein read the terms again, picked up the pen and wrote the name of the German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the end of the last letter, he saw the words on the paper appearing one by one, and they gathered into a brilliant brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
