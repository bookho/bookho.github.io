			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the words of Amyrius Levitt, not a question, Bilt’s forehead instantly burst into a dense cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his mouth as if he wanted to defend something, but in the end he slammed his knees and shuddered in the indescribable pressure: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Admiral, Admiral, the former tramp died of sudden illness, I had to find a new adventurer who could change."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Klein is not too nervous, because Admiral Levitte Levitt has noticed himself in the banquet hall, and it is unreasonable to recognize it now. It is extraordinary. He is also willing to meet rather than directly avoiding risks, indicating that he is not too concerned about who Bilt is looking for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not at all worried? This is the confidence of the demigod, or his extraordinary way to eliminate hidden dangers in advance... Klein struggled to raise his head and turned his eyes to the admiral who had already turned his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strong strength." Amyrius Levitt commented without expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still looks at Bill's knees on one knee:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't try to be at me Playing with the cleverness of those who can't get on the table.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The position of ordinary people and extraordinary people in this world is different, and I am in order The practitioner can clearly confirm this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, consistent with the description on the information, this general has a tendency to preach, I have to keep this in mind, this is with myself. In a different style from that of German Sparrow... Kline thoughtfully took his eyes back and cast it on the ground, as if he couldn't bear the pressure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Amyrius Levitt took a step forward: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Deception is the first mistake you made, and the second is not careful." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The tramp that has spent a lot of energy suddenly dies, and then an adventurer who can change looks in front of you. You don't think this is too coincidental. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it’s a bit clever... Klein almost repeated the other side’s question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t confirmed on the fog, he wondered if he was arranged by any mythological creature or “0” seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilter heard the pupils shrink and wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that he had just wanted to catch the last lifebuoy because of fear and fear, completely lost the cautiousness of experience, and never thought about Geer. Is it too coincidental that Man Sparrow's appearance is coming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time he went to the "sweet lemon" bar, the tramp was suddenly dying! The more Bilt thinks, the more he feels that he has fallen into a well-planned trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amyrius Levitt sees Bilt’s face changing again and again, and it’s a remorse and a sigh of relief:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My father, the old Earl of Levitt, who has passed away, once taught me a word.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said, forgive your men The first mistake made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bilter, you want to thank him for his kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilter's tense spirit A little ease, but inexplicably had a strong touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that Amyrius Levitt, who is closer to God than humans, will execute himself on the spot to warn all adventurers who secretly work for him. Who knows, the other party has chosen forgiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Admiral, I, I..." Bilt did not speak for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are two sentences in the last sentence, that is, 'severely punish their second mistake.', Bilt, do you know what to do in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Bilt, who was kneeling on one knee, immediately straightened his back and held his right fist to the left chest: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only loyalty to you!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amyrius nodded and turned to Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your name?"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It depends on which identity you are asking... Klein vomits in his heart and calmly replies:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German Sparo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amirius Levitt suddenly quiet for two seconds, the atmosphere in the utility room seems to be solidification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Klein couldn’t help but feel a little uneasy, Amyrius finally opened:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It turned out to be you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admiral, you are like knowing me, I am an ordinary military informant, only through you After receiving the bounty, I haven’t had time to reimburse anything... Klein secretly swears two sentences, the more I think, the more my heart is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amyrius has nosed his head, compared to Bilter and Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The plan is as usual Carry out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you need to sign a contract. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contract? Klein struggled against the majesty and looked up to Amyrius.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Admiral Amyrius did not explain anything. He picked up the paper and pen that had been prepared and placed on the window sill, and brushed it up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Every time I drop a pen, it seems that there is a golden glow, and the scene is solemnly sacred like drafting a law.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gradually narrows his eyes and begins to look away Blurred, couldn't help but lower his head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how long ago, Amyrius stopped the pen and picked up the sheet of paper, saying to Klein: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sign your name at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the terms are not satisfactory, you can not sign."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think I dare, or not? dare? Klein groaned, watching Bilt get up, took the pen and handed it to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms on the paper are very simple, only a few, which roughly constrains the behavior of German Sparrow playing Amyrius Levitt. , including but not limited to, unable to actively expose the problem, can not use the identity of the general to do things that are not conducive to Amyrius himself, can not have too close contact with Miss Cynthia, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that this big man wouldn’t care too much about the chastity of the mistress... This admiral is really an old man... but I am not that kind of person. ... Klein hides curiosity and asks like an academic question: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Miss Cynthia wants to have close contact with me?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His subtext is too alienated and resistant to being easily seen by Cynthia, asking how to grasp a degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter." Amyrius said with no expression. "You have no desire when you face her, or the body lacks the necessary ability." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can it still be like this? This contract is a bit powerful... In addition to the contract with the spiritual creatures, I was the first to see other contracts, and the former had to borrow the power of the underworld. This contract was only for the parties to the transaction... This is Admiral Amyrius. The semi-divine level extraordinary ability? What is the "arbitrator" approach? Klein took aim at the expiration date and found it to be five days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the last letter ends, he sees the words on the paper appearing one by one, gathering together into a splendid brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the splendid brilliance of the brilliance, the paper faded away, as if it were integrated with the rules of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible light fog around the body, Klein clearly felt that there was a layer of restrictions on his body that could not be described in words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These restrictions quickly internalize and temporarily become part of his spirit and body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray can withstand a certain degree of foreign doom and luck, but there is no way to shield the contract I have signed... Also, if it can be shielded, the courier’s contract Will not take effect... Klein has looked back to Amyrius Levitt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Admiral has converged his majesty at this time, and he has revealed a dark golden spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are symbols such as the "Judge of Judgment" and the densely marked magical symbols on the spell. The body is deep and deep, giving people the feeling of a code. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a high-level spell I made with my own blood, the ancient Quaternary Code and the royal '0' seal." Amyrius Said, "It's called the 'ninth law', can give a similar sense of majesty with a small amount of spirituality, even if ordinary people can do it. Without it, it is difficult for you to really disguise me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the sense of majesty of my change simulation is limited to the surface, usually no problem, once it is necessary to shake the man, it is useless... Klein quietly I was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amyrius continues: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With your current strength, you should be able to withstand it. Use.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By using it, you can specify the necessary limits for the target, so that he has to endure extremely unfavorable conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way, even if you have a partial temptation, you can scare him away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If nothing happens in the end, you don't need to use it, it will belong to you afterwards." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is valid for one year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? Klein was a glimpse, and immediately felt a strong surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the use of the high-level spell made by the "variant sun emblem", he finally has another one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This item has a time limit and can only be used once, but it has no negative effect. Of course, the harsh conditions make it a very large number. rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a demigod, it’s more generous than Bilt... Well, buying a tramp and a pirate general-level adventurer, the price is different... ... Klein was fascinated by the moment, silently reaching out and catching the high-level spell called "The Ninth Law." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he saw Amyrius untie the belt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a brief silence, Klein took control of the cockroach and took off his clothes without any expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he and Amyrius exchanged their dresses and put on the dark blue generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Amyrius and Bilt leave along the secluded path in the garden, and Klein meticulously made the button and turned to look at the glass window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark black and blushing moonlight of the night, the glass window is like a mirror, blurring the way Klein is now:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair combed after neatness, the deep blue eyes, the slightly drooping corners of the mouth, the unshaven face, the old-fashioned temperament, and the dark blue clothing with ribbons, medals and epaulettes . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein moved his mouth and said to himself silently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
