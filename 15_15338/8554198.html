			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the living room, Klein picked up the letter cutter, opened the seal and took out the letter from Essinger Stanton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The famous big detective wrote in the letter:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your thoughts gave us Great help, please allow me to thank you first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After receiving the letter from you, we immediately organized some staff to check some In the key areas, the corresponding clues were found, and many stray animals that often appeared nearby and were remembered by the residents were gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In this process, we also noticed an interesting thing. In the serial killing case four years ago, the goal was to be single and have a child's niece. Many people living around the crime scene once mentioned The most suspected teenager, though lonely and hazy, is very caring for animals, especially a black dog with a larger body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The boy died of the gang fire and the people around him never saw the dog again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am curious, it Who is the owner, is the murderer of an unbroken serial killing before a long time ago?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The above things are all in the 12th murderer The scene got some proof and played a key role in allowing the police to initially lock up the suspect. If everything goes well, we will be able to get most of the reward after the case is arrested."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My friend, I clearly remember your contribution and will not forget your one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger. Stanton seems to be a bit skeptical that I know the truth about the "devil", so deliberately hinting at something? Klein put down the stationery and silently shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this letter also made him really let go:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official extraordinary people did not find Wrong object! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the demon giant dog did not receive any additional help, it would be sooner or later to be arrested and killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Essinger Stanton’s guess that the other party has a master, Klein lacks sufficient evidence to confirm that there is only a certain probability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, my task ends here, and the next thing is the night sorcerer, the punitive, the mechanical heart squad." Klein took out a new paper. Pick up the round pen and give Essinger Stanton a letter of humility and ignore his subtle hints, just like a real ordinary private detective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After cutting a paper man, after leaving the door to send a good letter, Klein walked to the public carriage waiting for a point, thinking easily:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next, you can wait to collect the money..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reppard said that he wants to even watch For the three-day Russell Memorial, I have to wait until Saturday to find him and pay the final payment. I hope that the patent for the bicycle has already been applied. Oh, the efficiency of the Beckland Patent Office seems to have been low. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had already thought about the arrangement today, and he was suddenly idle when the extraordinary party could not be held and the corresponding items could not be bought. Down, I don’t need to be busy anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to the Cragg Club in the morning, practice guns, practice extraordinary abilities, and use lunch there, then find a better circus and watch the magician Performing, see if you can get some inspiration." He glanced out of the gold-shelled pocket watch and got into the public carriage in a good mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilston District, Craig Club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Klein came over twice a week, the waiters all remembered him, and he didn’t need to show his membership certificate and the hoarfrost badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Wednesday morning, most of the members of the Cragg Club belong to the more middle class, engaged in a fixed and decent job, not Zhou Day, not annual leave, not tea time, it is difficult to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spacious and bright hall looked very empty, and only a few people were sitting in the sofa area of ​​the corner coffee table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I swept there, Klein saw an acquaintance and went to say hello:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Talim, today's weather is so great, you should be at the racetrack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquaintance introduced him under Mrs. Mary. Joining the club's aristocratic equestrian teacher Tallim Dumont, he once brought a business to Klein, that is to protect the "Daily Observer" reporter Mike Joseph to "Golden Rose" to investigate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talim raised his head and touched his brown short curly hair, smiling: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hey, dear big detective, what have you been busy with recently? I haven't seen you for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been that you haven’t been to the club for a few days. Klein smiled and sat down on the sofa next to Talim:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the police to investigate the serial killings, although not necessarily rewarding But the bounty is tempting enough, and establishing a good relationship with the police department is very important for our private detectives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above are all bragging, I It was just an inconspicuous role called up... He ridiculed himself in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members sitting in the sofa area behind them are guided by a man suspected of a stockbroker to discuss the latest Western Railway stock and Dongbai Long plantation stock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to Klein, Tallim has no doubts, hehe laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is really a busy detective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few words, he gradually entered a state of thoughtfulness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Klein planned to leave for the underground shooting range, Talim suddenly looked at him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mr. Moriarty, can I ask a question?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, you can receive a consultation fee."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is free, and, call me Sherlock." Klein laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talim gently nodded and hesitated and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a friend , fell in love with people who should not love, how to deal with this situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I always think that when asking similar questions, "I have a friend "It is equal to "myself", but Tallim's emotional color is not his own, he is very embarrassed, but can't see the slightest pain... Klein, who opened the vision, leaned back and held his hands: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I am not a psychiatrist, nor an expert in newspapers and magazines who is good at solving emotional problems."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My only suggestion is not to break the law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, this is a joke, first of all, we have to figure out 'no 'What is it from? Is there a hate relationship between the families of both parties?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talim looked at him, helplessly:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "No, this is not the story of Romeo and Juliet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard's answer, Klein's ear seems to sound a whisper of illusion : <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; author: Russell Peters Gustav ...... author: Russell Gustav ...... author: Russell Augusta The husband...[br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said sorry to Sha’s father, smiling:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This work by Russell the Great is too classic. When I mention love that should not be, I will think of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, what? Why shouldn't they be together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talim silently for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to keep it secret, sorry, I didn't ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidential? That is a very personal person... I fell in love with the same sex? Fall in love with people with blood relations? Klein resisted the strong curiosity and said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I can only give one more suggestion, take a look at "Storm Mountain Villa", "Love and Beggar" Affectionate best-selling novels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talim sighed a few lips and sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, this can only be the last resort. In my opinion, the feelings in those best-selling novels don't seem to happen between normal humans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I think so too!" Klein echoed with deep sympathy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a smile with Tallim, he got up and went to the underground shooting range to practice his guns and practice his extraordinary ability. When he arrived at noon, he returned to the first floor and went straight to the self-help. restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has previously noticed that today's limited supply is red wine fried foie gras with apple slices and bread immersed in butter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the food, Klein carries the plate and walks to the table where Talim is, and at this moment, there is Talim, there are Another acquaintance, his acquaintance, also introduced him to the club's surgeon, Alan Kreis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just put the plate, and still have time to sit down, Klein suddenly found the famous surgeon's chair next to the cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Allen, what's wrong?" he asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall, thin, cold-faced, Allen wearing a pair of gold-rimmed glasses patted the right leg:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, don't mention, this is really unlucky! I fell off the stairs, there was a more serious fracture, only plaster can be fixed."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really bad luck.” Klein echoed and sighed, and cut a piece of foie gras, stuffed with simmered juice, and it melted like a touch of fat. The aroma is constantly expanding, stimulating every taste bud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been unlucky for a long time." Allen raised his hand and pushed down the frame, slamming his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately looked at Klein and looked at Talim again, hesitating and asking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mr. Moriarty, do you have it, have you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Klein asked, looking up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen slammed the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a well-known big detective, there should be Know a lot of people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately." Klein didn't understand what the other side meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan looked at Tallim again and took a breath:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have Do you know people like rural witch doctors? No, I mean, some fortunetellers or occult enthusiasts, I think, I think, my recent unlucky is too abnormal..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that those are likely to be fake, deceptive, but there is no other way to get rid of bad luck, I tried to pray in the church, donate, attend mass, but nothing Role."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some diviners or occultists... You seem to be saying me... Klein thinking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allen, you talk about it in detail, what happened to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thalim next to it Nod:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, although I am a believer in the Lord, I do not exclude occultism."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen sighs distressedly Road:; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp <br <br /> & nbsp />;</div>
