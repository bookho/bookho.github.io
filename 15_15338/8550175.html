			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blushing moon of high altitude hangs quietly in the darkness, shining on the city of Tingen, which is gradually falling into silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stands at the desk and looks down at the cold and uninhabited daffodil street through the belly window, and hears the horse carriage flying fast but not in the distance. Passed by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the silver-and-white pocket watch with a vine pattern, slammed it open, glanced at it, then reached out and pulled the curtains together to make the gas light more yellowish. Reflected in the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned unhurriedly, locked the door and closed the gate valve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole room was suddenly shrouded in darkness, only a little reddish moonlight through the curtains brought color, bringing night scenes that gave birth to many folk stories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this environment, Klein took out a silver knife that he applied for, and outlined the light ball in his mind, and entered the state of semi-meditation in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saved his spirit, according to the previous practice, let the spirituality spray out through the tip of the knife, and let them follow the movement of their own, combined with the environment, sealed the room . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is an abnormal fluctuation that may occur under the defense, and he is afraid that Benson and Melissa will be awakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Klein put down the knife and walked four steps counterclockwise, each step accompanied by a mantra from the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constant screams and whistle hit, the constant madness and pain added, he tried to control himself, in the almost half confused state The most difficult and dangerous stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray mist is boundless, the deep red "star" is far or near, and the temple of the scorpion seems to die like a giant, and everything in front of Klein is in the past Compared, there is no change, thousands of years of accumulated silence and ancient bounces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, there are still changes! Klein silently talked to himself, staring at a deep red "star" in the vicinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the star that symbolizes "justice"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep red of this "star" has contracted and expanded in succession, but the extent is not large, but persistence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein carefully developed his own spirituality and spread to the deep red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a contact between the two, and his mind suddenly snorted, saw a blurry and distorted picture, and heard an illusory and overlapping prayer:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Followers who are not in this era;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the mysterious ruler above the fog;" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the king of yellow and black who are in good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for you Help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for your care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray that you let me own A good dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I pray that you will have a good dream. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray that you will have a good dream."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of women is constantly reverberating, interlaced, and the spirit of Klein follows Become irritable and messy, like just about to fall asleep, but heard upstairs pounded hit the floor quarrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed his emotions, healed the impulse with meditation, and carefully identified the blurred picture that appeared in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the distorted picture, Klein barely recognized this as Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he completely confirmed that the ritual mantra he had conceived could point precisely here, pointing to himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes him full of sense of accomplishment and feels that his exploration from nothing has been very effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t boast of it... Klein’s mood is getting better, and the pray of flies in his ears is acceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved in his heart, trying to pass the "answer" outlined in his mind to the "dark red" star through the subtle connection:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The front of the fog is filled with a layer of distorted and blurred people standing in the deepest part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a deep red in his eyes, and the voice reverberates in an empty world:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey Hall suddenly woke up, and was seated in his mind It is the picture that I just dreamed of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clearly knows that she dreams of a fool, the mysterious fool above the fog! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a response to my early morning prayers?" Audrey, who quickly entered the "audience" state, calmly analyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she does not understand why the fools don’t respond on the spot, they have to wait until the night, but they are still valid by the ritual magic, and they are really shocked by the useful spells. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past she prayed to the goddess of the night, but never got a response! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Fool, even if it is not a god, should be similar... Audrey slowly took a breath and slowly spit it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the other party is a strong presence that cannot resist, she quickly put some worries aside and began to think about what to do next:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, thoroughly digest the 'audience' potion... my 'play' is not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Second, looking for a psychological alchemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Third, see if you can get the 'reader' formula from Mr. Fool, or A clue to the psychological alchemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, every deity-like existence has its own complete sequence chain, and does not necessarily know the recipes of other sequence pathways. ... The psychologically alchemy society, a new and extraordinary organization, is not necessarily qualified to receive the attention of Mr. Fool..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disengagement, Klein was in a good mood and sat on the top of the bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was covered in fog, leaning back against the back of the chair, holding his fists against his mouth, recalling and examining the process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, this gray world, only one of his creatures, in addition, silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that only the information can be passed in the past, and it is impossible to mobilize the power here... It seems that my previous tricks will not work." Klein continues Sneering mouth, silently summed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His original intention was that if the mantra and ritual of the design were effective, then try to bind himself and the foggy world in this way. In order to incite the power of this mysterious space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, he can hold a ritual first, pray to the "self" for the gift of the spell, then, enter the fog, and respond to this prayer and give gifts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I still think too beautiful... I haven’t reached that level of understanding and mastering this foggy world..." Klein shook his head. Self-deprecating, ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he saw the crimson "star" symbolizing "upside down" also began to shrink and expand, hearing illusory and invisible The sound circled in a circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just happened to meet the ‘hanging man’ ceremony?” Klein nodded thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat on the top of the bronze long table and reached out to the "star". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit spreads out and touches the deep red that shrinks and expands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the infinitely overlapping prayers of "upside down people" and saw blurred pictures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the picture, the "inverted man" is wearing a pure black robes, standing before the four groups of fire, surrounded by spirituality into a wall, separated from the external influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t respond immediately, just watched quietly and listened quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...You are the king of yellow and black in charge of good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray Your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pour the person" prayed for a moment When there is no response, they begin to dispel the spiritual wall, extinguish the flame, and clean up the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, he reached out and the water filled the table, and the table that served as the altar was immediately renewed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Watery spells...the gift of the storm...the 'downside man' is indeed, at least, the 'voyager'..." Klein slightly decapitated, in the picture Before disappearing, the "response" was passed into the group of deep red as expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger Wilson is in the capital of the Rothde Islands city". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not go to the famous "Red Theater" with the crew, but stayed in the hotel, closed the doors and windows, and tried the ceremony described by the fool. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completely praying, Alger patiently waited for a while, but did not receive any response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that this attempt is not very successful... Mr. Fool has to change the way..." He was glad and thought with a little disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After handling the follow-up, Alger plans to go downstairs to have a cup of "strong lyrics" - alcohol helps to play the "furious people" ability, so " The punitives of the Lord of the Storm are quite fond of this "beverage." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door, Alger is just about to step out, seeing a flower in front of him, seeing the illusory and innocent fog above the corridor, seeing a blurred figure Sitting in the deepest position, like sitting on the throne of the high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." The familiar and low voice echoed invisibly in Alger’s ear, leaving him in the same place, his head feeling a little painful. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger’s eyes turned deep, and then looked around, only to find that everything was the same as before, still the floor that would slam on the floor, still It is a wall candlestick with years, it is still a corridor that is not too clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know... Alger’s ear seems to have a sound echoing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's face sinking, his fist hitting his chest, but he couldn't say the honor of the Lord of the Storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long silence, Alger’s expression returned to normal, but his eyes were deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
