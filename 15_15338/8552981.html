			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the living room where only one candle shines is as silent as solidification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, the man who was suspected of "pharmacist" muttered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Why don't you leave an address? So I can get something from your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks like a curse, but actually advises... Klein pretends not to understand Look at the "black snake" road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No gambling, I am not alive, gambling, at least there is still a little hope."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not sit and wait for the advent of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this sentence, this is to be opened The "eye of wisdom" old man closed his mouth because he could not provide other hopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I appreciate your character!" "Black Snake" haha ​​laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also appreciate that many of my former friends were of this character. I am going to put a bunch of flowers in front of their tombstone every year." Suspected The pharmacist's man whispered and sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't care that the "black snake" can fight than he can, and he wants to say something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. "Pharmacist" must have eaten because of his temper... Klein secretly grateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He handed the iron cigarette case with the extraordinary characteristics of the "hunter" to the waiter who brought him in, and watched the other person walk to the "eye of wisdom" "before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old gentleman counted 400 pounds of cash from the suitcase next to him and let the waiter give it to the "black snake." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Snake" casually glanced at it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe in the 'eye of wisdom' "Mr."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a small wooden box from his arms, bent it to the ground, pushed it hard, and let the item slide in front of Klein, without going through waiter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Klein’s fingers touched the surface of the box, a slight auditory hallucination occurred immediately behind the ear, creating a sense of dizziness caused by severe bumps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For him, this is not an unacceptable thing, and the degree is not even comparable to the illusory voice of "justice" and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sitting upright, Klein carefully opened the wooden box and saw an "ear" inside! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ear is like a real thing, but the skin is black and there are a few places where it rots green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do I use it?" Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Snake" answers casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You hold it without gloves, It's like using it, oh, you'd better go home and try again, try again when you are alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't ask more, put the box Closed, put a pocket, and deliberately smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This makes people feel dizzy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After a brief silence, the man suspected of "pharmacist" suddenly shouted: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to buy the medullary crystal of the 'spring of the elves', who has it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the voice reverberation, no one answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pharmacist" licked his lower lip and shouted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True, every time None."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you can book a ticket to the island of Sunia." "The Eye of Wisdom" smiled and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Spring of the Elf" is also known as the "Guiquan Golden Spring". From the name, it knows where it is produced. The water of the "Spring of the Elf" is common. It is a spiritual thing, and the medullary crystal is an extraordinary material, not so easy to buy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, there were several trade abortions at the party. The "eye of wisdom" Mr. the old man took the hand: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get here today, by convention, one Leave one place and three minutes apart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One by one... Three minutes apart... Is this afraid of someone going out to track or even rob other party members? Klein received the "eye of wisdom" prompt, stood up, and led by the waiter, left the living room and came to the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off his hooded robes and gave it to the other side, then returned to the back door of the "Brave Bar" along the road in memory, and then removed The iron mask, through the kitchen, saw the Casper standing outside the card in the noise of the dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I feel very pleased when you can come back." The red-nosed old man was obviously relieved, and the sly wound on his face seemed to be shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein moved closer and pressed down the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are there such a party after that?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you didn't get what you want, the storm is on, I don't think you need to waste any more time." Casper swept away. The customer who has peace of mind has a look, "Maybe it will be a few days later, I don't know if I can see if you can catch it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein Point I turned to the next question and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maric is there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want Trying to convince him? No, it only irritates him!” Casper screamed. “He is in the card room behind you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I don't intend to convince him, but try to stay away from him, lest his living body rebel... Klein touched the Azick copper sentry in his pocket:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately leave the brave bar, to the East in a circle after a turnover bedroom return to Minsk streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the card room, Maricha had all the chips and turned his confidence in the cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has three K, a pair of 9, and the opposite of his living corpse is a pair of 6, one 8. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the living corpse took the initiative to show the cards, a pair of 6! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This game, four 6 wins! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale-looking Maric squatted there, and immediately felt the eyes of all the living corpses around him looking cold and faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, he volatility left the card room and almost fell to the door, and his subordinates often fell in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before the morning, don't let people in." Maric looked at the stunned Casper, hoarse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out a white handkerchief and wiped his mouth. It was quickly dyed with a blue-red color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting a positive response from Casper, Maric casually found a chair and sat down, asked for a barrel of Nanwell beer, and squinted straight. , sluggish for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 Minsk Street, Klein stepped back to the house, Pulled the curtains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for ten minutes and confirming that there is no spiritual light around, he started to call himself and responded to himself, connecting the black ear to the wood. The boxes are carried together into the mysterious space above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusory crimson star is dotted below, without the slightest flash, Klein sits at the top of the old long table and opens the wooden box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he didn’t have any auditory hallucinations or dizziness, and the boundless fog seemed to isolate all the outside sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein suddenly breathed a sigh of relief and confidence in the next attempt, security confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved his mind, blocked his hearing, and did several experiments to confirm the effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good... Klein nodded with satisfaction, reached out and grabbed the black ear with only decay marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ice cold and greasy touch into the brain, he did not hear the sound of the great existence described by the "black snake." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is completely isolated? This doesn't work... It's not easy to use..." Klein wondered and thought about what to do to motivate the effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, he has a paper-and-paper pen, intending to imitate the process of peeping into the "eternal sun". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That time is the blood of God, looking directly at the eternal sun, this time only the items left by the "listeners", certainly not so dangerous... ... Klein wrote down the divination statement: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The source of this item."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He took a breath, held the black ear, leaned back and meditated on the divination statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven times, his eyes turned deep and he entered the sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vague, broken, gray world, Klein saw a man struggling on the ground, he rolled, screaming, his eyes protruding. The body expands into a balloon, and countless hairs become black and long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, a sinful, extremely filthy voice came into Klein’s ear and instantly woke him up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the slang and slang before entering the mysterious space above the fog, this sound is more penetrating, more purposeful, and more proactive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein grabbed his ears and isolated the follow-up, but the voice echoed in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw his blood vessels and blue veins protruding out, seemingly turned into a creepy, thick snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His blood vessels burst open, the blue veins broke away from the body, and spread out into a slippery tentacle full of evil patterns, and the fog was slightly swaying, let There is a little sign of corrosion in the palace of the giant residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the eternal glory, Klein still has reason left, not rolling over, he clenches the handrail and endures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, the swaying fog returned to calm, and the evil voice echoed in Kline’s mind completely subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root "tentacle" fell and his wounds began to heal quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a dangerous thing to deal with the gods, no matter which way... Fortunately, this time there is no face to the 'real creator', or else crazy and Most of the loss of control will survive a little, and affect the body of the real world..." Klein leaned against the back of the chair weakly, silently ridiculed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process is basically in his expectation, and the whole is not beyond his control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that surprised him was that the "real creator" seemed to be stronger than the "eternal yang"...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein’s thoughts were about to diverge, he saw that the black ear in the palm suddenly collapsed and turned into a tiny spot of light, a light black spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to purely extraordinary characteristics? Klein was puzzled, and the corner of his eye was aiming at the root tentacles of the evil pattern that was still twitching on the ground. It was the madness and loss of control that was stripped from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tentacles are gradually transparent and will soon disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s sudden flash of light flashed the tiny light black spot in the palm of the hand to the slippery tentacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusory black air rises and turns into a sky with lightning passing through, and the background is rich and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this quickly disappeared into Klein’s eyes, and there were many iron black spells with symbols, magic signs, evil patterns, and twisting numbers on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
