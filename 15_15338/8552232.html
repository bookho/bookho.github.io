			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey's eyes are light, and their thoughts are divergent. A lot of things have been analyzed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Descartes has described that Qilingus is a lone wolf. He does not believe anyone. His plan of action only knows himself. Except I found out in advance, no one should know that he will assassinate tonight...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only told the father of Grammer that the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qilingus pretends to be a father and "Mr."...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a telegraph line in the house of the Duke of Nigan, it is possible to pass the information out in time and find help, but there is no need to hide it... Dad’s confusion shows that killing Qilingus The strong are not what they expected...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, the person who killed the Kiringes can almost be identified as the "fool" Mr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only the special mode of our Tarot will be able to create a strange situation with unknown motives! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qilings is the "winder" of Sequence 6, and also has the magical item "squirming hunger", which can quickly kill him without leaving traces. Only the high-sequence strong called "half-god and half-human"? Or, using a seal that is very dangerous in rumors? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the possibility, it is enough to show that Mr. Fool’s family is extremely powerful...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp It is not a "fool" Mr.! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, I have provided clues, and Mr. "Down Man" has to fulfill his promise and give me the pituitary body of the colorful lizard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be the first formal action of our Tarot Club? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qilingus, one of the seven pirate generals, died as a result! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing her daughter’s contemplation with a little excitement, Earl, a handsome man who was a young man, coughed a little and warned more seriously:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Audrey, I know that you are very interested in things in the mysterious field, and usually indulge you, but this thing, you must not be involved, even inquire No, you will be led by the Queen at the end of the year and officially introduced into social occasions. As an adult, you should be clear and remember that a horrible extraordinary person, or a secret, powerful organization, is often equated with danger. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, Dad." Audrey replied softly, "I was just a little curious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Curious is not good!" Earl Hall emphasized this sentence and couldn't help but show a helpless smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm!" Audrey was busy nodding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I know the whole thing better than you... She made a face in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl Earl thought about it and said with a gentle smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what, you are Tonight's hero is the savior of the Duke of Nigan, at least half of the death of Kiringus is attributed to you, and the bounty is the same. Of course, if no one admits that he killed Qilingus, he claims this Responsible for the matter, and take the initiative to collect the bounty, the remaining half will belong to you, add up to a total of 10,000 gold pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, because Bounty donations established by countries and organizations such as the Republic of Tis, the Fossack Empire, etc. can also be sent to collect, and there should be 20,000 gold pounds converted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Duke of Nigan has promised that he will give you his vacation home in Desi Bay. This includes a large rubber forest. I didn't know the annual income, but it will not be low. He spent 8,000. The Golden Pound was bought, and the house was built and the good seeds were purchased."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already 300,000 pounds of property Lai enough to be called rich, but close to or above 40,000 pounds a reward for her, it's still a huge amount of income, many aristocratic lady dowry are lower than this number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August, a marriage between aristocrats and merchants, Miss Mary Aldbury, the daughter of the millionaire, also married 80,000 gold pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't even think about the bounty..." Audrey whispered from the bottom of her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she thought of one thing. If she went to collect the bounty and let her name go out, then the "downside man" would be able to easily determine "justice." who is it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not enough! As a member of the Tarot Club, I have to remain mysterious! Audrey looked to her father and organized the following language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, I am a little scared..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? What happened?" Earl asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I preached out, I found out that Zilingers was posing as Baron Graham. I was afraid that his men would retaliate against me. I was afraid that he would assassinate him behind the scenes. The Duke’s people will stare at me...” Audrey tried to make herself look pitiful, weak, and helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will ask someone to protect you." Earl Hall responded first, then sighed first, "but there is really no need for you to take this risk." And the people who killed the Kiringes took away the 'squirming hunger'. Of course, for the high-sequence strong, this is not a persuasive motivation, um... I will tell the Duke of Nigan, Let him conceal this thing, and he will find another person to collect the bounty, and then privately compensate you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking here, Earl Hall smiles道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s my daughter, I’ve earned 40,000 gold pounds, which is more than one tenth of your current wealth.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 300,000 pounds was pre-segmented by him, giving his daughter’s property, and waiting for her to marry, she will make up a part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you have a good father?" Audrey asked rejoicingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl Earl shakes his head and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than me, I first came from The commercial gain is only £60.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey became very happy, the £40,000 bounty, the father’s compliment, led to “the hurricane Will "Qilingus die and complete a sense of accomplishment that can't be a thing, as the pride of the members of the "Tarot Club", will be the colorful lizard dragon pituitary that will be obtained from the "downside down" afterwards, let her It’s not just double happiness, it’s three times, even four times, five times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really want to report to Mr. Fool immediately, get his confirmation... No, no, mysterious powerhouse with unknown motives killed Qilingus Now, some people are observing me in secret, looking for clues, I can't show the slightest exception... Hey! I have nothing unusual, as long as I don’t try to mourn the name of Mr. Fool’s name...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, if it’s really the “fool’s” He must have known the result, and I don’t need to report it again... oh... Do I need to share the reward with the other person? No, 20,000 pounds of money will inevitably attract attention regardless of the way it is paid. I can't take this risk...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and, always "Hanging people" is asking for help from Mr. "fool", and he should be paid by him. Well, he claims to have many Russell diaries! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I try to collect some diaries, thank you Mr. Fool for responding to my prayers, and he certainly can’t see vulgar money...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey quickly determined what to do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residence of the Duke of Nigan, in a small private study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obese tall duke sits on a high back chair behind the desk, smoking a cigar, looking at the opposite "Song of the Gods" Al Sneek And the Prime Minister of the Kingdom, Aguhid Nigen, and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the feedback of the information, it is impossible to confirm which high-ranking strongman is doing this." Aguhid just came back from the king. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop Sneek followed and nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We also confirmed it by extraordinary means, not The well-known high-sequence strong ones are not the ones of the spiritual group."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
