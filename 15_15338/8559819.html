			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the deck, into the cabin, to find the room, Klein was about to talk, Anderson Hood was the first to say:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is not right... If I am a passenger of this ship, seeing you as an adventurer who just offended the 'King of Undead', will be very scared and nervous, or look for a boat captain. The deputy will convince you to change a ship, or change the ship yourself. Who knows, they are very calm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is very keen, in some detail The problem is very insightful... Is this the real “conspirator”? Usually hey, haha, his mouth is optimistic, in fact, he has mastered the situation and prepared himself... Klein took the key to open the door and considered whether the ship really had problems. At this time, Anderson raised his hand and patted his face, laughing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand the reason!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The interval is too short, things are only spread in some adventurers and pirates, the average passenger and the sailors on board There is no understanding at all, and it is clear that you must be a well-informed person, not an ordinary person. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哟, will ask yourself to answer... Do you know that time is life? Klein whispered a few words and entered first class.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not that he wants to live comfortably, but considers that he must watch Anderson Hood, not let the bad luck of the most unlucky hunters bring disaster to the passenger ship, so let the other party order First class.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carrying a suitcase and walking to the door of the main bedroom, Klein pointed to the guest bedroom and servant room, to Anderson Road: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You pick one yourself. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson stayed for two seconds, half a mouthful:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very skilled ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I have a lot of experience with hunters, if Daniz is here, I will appoint a servant room... Klein does not respond , entered the master bedroom.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 1:30, the whistle sounded and the passenger liner set sail on time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hanging the jacket, Klein wore trousers, shirts and vests, walked out of the master bedroom, and came to the living room, looking out at the sea level line outside the window.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a blue wave , along the contours of Toscat Island, unfolding in the wind, fluctuating in the wind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible to observe the whole situation. Anderson came over and said with a smile. "You can only determine one side, and the 'death' may be from the other side, or from the front. The best way is to climb the observatory, haha, there must be a crew there. However, an experienced hunter or pirate has a hundred ways to deceive his senses! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned and looked at Anderson Hood without any expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This matter is handed over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Anderson looks Awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately woke up and asked in a somewhat surprised way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have no other way to observe ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I bury the trap of the "King of Undead" in the absence of observation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Klein was so unusually calm, "You can only rely on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;......Who is the courage to give you, let you dare to leave under the gaze of the "immortal king"? Anderson couldn’t speak for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He muttered to himself, "Don’t stop me, I want to jump," while leaving the cabin and heading straight under the observatory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, the "immortal king" Agarito, or "death", should have been aware of my malice, and it has been induced by I am in danger, then, will they come to attack? I will believe that I am showing this level, and there is no helper. Is there any doubt that anyone who can interfere with the dangerous premonition will intervene? Klein took his eyes back from the door and looked at the sea again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he suddenly felt a little, quickly opened the vision, looking sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall white bone messenger was drilled from the floor surface and the dark flame in the eye socket jumped slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only reveals the upper body, so it is not much higher than Klein, looking at the other side, and handing out the letter paper in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Azick’s reply was very fast... Klein’s courtesy was taken and he took over the neatly folded paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Bone Messenger messes down, he unfolds the letter of the sun outside the window:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ...I am very glad that you have been promoted and your travel experience is more interesting than I thought.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sea is really dangerous, I vaguely remember that it might The source of the Cataclysm is related. As for why the ancient gods had breaths left there, I am not quite sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your reminder I will remember that I will not enter the sea area until the memory is completely restored. The slang of the 'real creator' is not good.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am interested in the ring in the hand of 'Hell Admiral', but I have been entangled in a past event, and it may take some time to visit him. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Klein’s face involuntarily reveals a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc. I sent a letter to Mr. Azker, telling him that I have the means to lock the position of "Hell Admiral" Ludwig, and let him take me when I visit. Oops, there is no such thing as the divination of the diviner. I don't know if Ludwell discovered it, would it have already thrown it away... Well, wait until the "death" will not catch up, then go to the divination on the fog...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sight movement, Klein continues reading:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ancient literature from Catalina In fact, the story of the artificial death god, in simple terms, the royal family of the spiritual sect of the past empire, suddenly came alive from the 'hidden sage', and got inspiration from the case of personality, hoping that only It is the same as the concept of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This has the potential to be realized, because the extraordinary is not extinguished, the fall of death does not mean that the corresponding characteristics and authority are completely lost, they still exist, just return to the concept and abstraction The state is like the earliest 'hidden sage'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the literature, there is no breakthrough in the corresponding research, but it has been hundreds of years. The previous thing...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The '4 divination' corresponding to the sequence 4 potions called '诡法师', Antigonus and the Charato family The strong man left a deep impression on me, even if I have forgotten the details, I can still remember the feeling of being a little scared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know where to get the recipes and materials. Maybe you can consider moving to a similar path. I have already recalled this. You can choose the sequence of 'Apprentice' 4 'Secret Master', 'The Thief' The sequence of the route 4' parasites, however, I vaguely remember that these three pathways should be sequence 3 Interchange..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough...only the "mirror" Arodes hopes... Klein forcibly opened his mouth and smiled.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the reply, he took out the pen and paper, brushed and brushed the part of what he just thought, and asked the specific definition of "mythological creature" by the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not in a hurry to summon the messenger, put the paper and the pen down, prepare for the "death", and then send the request for help in the letter, In this way, after he used the "Poseidon Scepter" to support the space for a while, he might wait until Mr. Azke shuttled to the spiritual world to come to the rescue. At that time, when the two joined forces, there was hope that the "death" would be mentioned. The reason why you don't write in advance is because the "demon" can detect the danger and will not come over. Of course, the other party can detect the specific content of the malicious. Klein is also unknown.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patience waited for a few hours, Klein heard the door open, turned back Seeing Anderson squinting at the side of his head, his face came in complicatedly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'death' did not appear, we are now completely out of the waters of Toskat Island ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
