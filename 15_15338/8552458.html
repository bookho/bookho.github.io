			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby in the belly of Megakos made a crying cry. I want to help my mother get out of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black, cold, creamy thin line seemed to be frightened, and seemed to be caught by invisible forces, and they went backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den and Klein have both obvious dizziness and throat Tightening, the trachea is constantly compressed, and breathing becomes difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their noses, their eyes, their ears, dripping red down, all the capillaries seem to have cracked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Klein before he entered the fog, he would always stand the test of slang and swearing, if it wasn’t for Dunn’s hand holding the ashes of Saint Selena, they It must have been fainting, like Leonard Mitchell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mego Oss's headless body turned over, facing Klein, scorching to a piece of fallen skin flesh and holiness The fascinating white bone knife clearly reflected the other's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just relying on a wealth of experience to get rid of the impact of Klein’s scalp, he forgot the pain in his right chest and seemed to have seen each other madly flashing. Don't mourn the mantra at all, perfuse the spirit, throw out the "yangyan spell" opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was about to evade, Klein saw Megacoos suddenly stagnate and saw Dunn Smith’s black trench coat fluttering backwards and saw The captain in front of the slanted head buried his head, and the back highlighted a thick, squirming strip of things, like a snake underneath, hiding tentacles, hiding monsters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn is using his "nightmare" ability to force interference with Megaco. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! Mei Gaoousi was just a struggle, and the thick strips that Deng En highlighted on him exploded at the same time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large amount of bright red blood splatters out and rushes to every corner around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this result, the pale-faced Dunn was not depressed, because the blood was absorbed by the black thin lines of the roots of the Saint Serena ashes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absorbed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless cold, slippery, tentacle-like thin lines that become violent, retreat into progress, back up, and entangled in plum Gao Osi, entangled her high-pitched, squirming abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is nervous and delighted, and the ancient Hermes words corresponding to "light" have been brewed in the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow! Wow! Wow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cry of the baby is ringing again, more than just Continuous, more urgent than just now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black, innumerable, almost invisible thin lines suddenly felt like a thunder, trembled and smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun looked at this scene and found that Mei Gaoousi was about to get out of trouble. The expression on his face changed a bit, and he almost regained his right hand without hesitation. Five fingers, slammed into his chest, left chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His right hand quickly pulled out, it was stained with blood, and the five fingers clasped a heart with a feeling of tranquility at night and a change of dreams, a Still shrinking and inflating the heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain... Klein watched as Dunn Smith stuffed his right hand into the casket of St. Serena, his eyes flickering blurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the nightmare is dark, the sound of the nightmare sounds, and the countless black thin lines are re-tightened with an unusually cold and calm feeling, firmly, I have been smothered by Mega Koos! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there was a baby crying from the belly of Megakos, they did not loosen, and even locked this terrible voice in their own package! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s tears mixed with blood falling down, and a mouthful of ancient Hermes words spit out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Light!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light up the dark light! Bring warm light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His residual spirituality was almost all infused into the thin gold piece engraved with mysterious patterns, and the head was suddenly empty and dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiating the last effort, Klein threw out the "Yangyan Charm" and threw it at Mecoos, which was banned by countless black lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, those black lines did not retreat in advance, no longer follow the instinct, as if they were instructed by a certain will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compass!噗通! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the casket of St. Serena, Dunn’s bright red heart is still beating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun once again penetrated the big hole in the ceiling, penetrated the entire third floor, and entered the Black Thorns Security Company, almost consolidating into a substantial column. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pulled by the "Yangyan Charm" and reflected to Mei Gaoousi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two merge above the headless monster, like a sun burst! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blazing glory, Klein closed his eyes and engraved the last picture in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meco Oss lost his left arm, lost his head, lost a lot of flesh and blood, the black body instantly collapsed, there is a half illusory and semi-real horrible things no longer have real dependence, can not complete the transformation The last step, unwillingly and angrily turned into black gas, melted into the light and flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole house is shaking violently, but this is only a little aftershock of the "Yangyan Charm". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike normal bombs, its power condenses and ends! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein barely held his body and opened his eyes to look forward in a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a wall collapsed, and he saw a circle of burnt black in the place where Megakos stood, and the floor was only half melted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a blood-stained, curled, smoldering umbilical cord, and he saw Dunn Smith wearing a black thin trench coat. Still standing in the same place, I saw the heart in the Saint Selina casket still beating slowly, seeing Leonard Mitchell knowing that he was dead and lying alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highly tired Klein’s heart is a joy, it seems that he can still rescue the captain with ritual magic, feeling that Megacoos and the baby in her belly are really solved. No, the latter is closer to being interrupted and expelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Dunn Smith turned his head and looked at Klein, with a gentle and relaxed smile on his pale face, and his voice was as mellow as ever: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We saved Tingen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he was like going back to twenty At the age of the year, it was no longer so calm and no longer serious, and Klein squeezed his left eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's expression solidified on his face, and saw that the heart in the Saint Serena casket stopped beating, turned into a sly spot, dissipated Going around, I saw the captain’s body tilting backwards and his hands loosened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a picture frame, but it can't stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Selina’s casket fell to the ground, like the heart of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
