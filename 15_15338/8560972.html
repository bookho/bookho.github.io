			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a “snake of destiny” interested in what is appropriate? Klein slowly sat up and took a pillow cushion behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a while and decided not to consider this matter anyway. Anyway, it was at least a month before Will was born, and he could still This problem was thrown at the "hidden" Jia Delia or the "mysterious queen" behind her, Bernard, let them worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Klein does not rule out the possibility that Will Unsetin’s whimsy will determine premature birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly turned his attention to making the "bug of the time" spell, according to "The Snake of Destiny" Will. With almost all the conditions, there is only one corresponding symbol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray to the "fool", with the help of the mysterious space above the fog... I don't know if the symbol of the "stealer" path does not work... even if I don't know, unless I can pull a thief into the fog and let the corresponding high back chair show the pattern... When Klein honed the details, he suddenly came up with an idea:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, maybe you can try the symbol behind the seat of the "fool"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half represents a special symbol of the hidden "innocent eye" and half of the "distorted line" that symbolizes change! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if there is any use... Divination can't be done, but I can predict whether the attempt will go smoothly, and even if it fails, it should be a problem. Not big, anyway, praying for yourself, even if the material is worn out in the experiment, it just enters the fog and will not be lost..." Thinking of this, Klein was a little excited, could not help but turn over and get ready tonight. Do "experiment"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The worm of time" This material belongs to the "stolen" half-death of Amon, although it is dead, but the essence is still, the level is still In the spells made with it, even if it is a problem, it will not reach the angel order, and it will not be too far apart. It belongs to the peak power of the saints. If Klein succeeds, it will be equal to the card, the key moment. Maybe it will give him more life, which makes him not excited, how not to expect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only shake the little power of the mysterious space above the fog, the level of the "bug of the time" spell should drop a little, but no matter how It must be stronger than the "ninth law" that Admiral Amyrius gave me... If you use the "spoken language" to make the advanced spell of the demon field, it should be almost the same as the ninth law, but unfortunately, I dare not pray to the "Cosmic Dark Side"... Klein is wearing pajamas, barefoot, and walks four steps on the soft and thick carpet, whispering the mantra and entering the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sitting at the top of the "Foot" position on the bronze long table, he has a dark red round pen and yellow brown parchment, and writes the corresponding divination. statement:; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; <br <br /> & nbsp /> "I will spell is about to begin production smoothly." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; within the cuffs off his With the spirit, Klein held the hand in his left hand and began to meditate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After repeating the divination statement seven times, he opened his eyes and looked forward. He saw the citrine pendant turning clockwise, the speed was slow, and the amplitude was normal. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means going well...but the question is, is it a good way to verify that the symbol is useful, or is it valid to verify that it is useless? Senior divinist Klein tried to interpret the revelation, but could not get a definitive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, he can only decide to experiment, because otherwise it is impossible to rule out the error. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Then, Klein and wrote a new divination statement: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "this week in and week Five assassinations of Mr. X’s actions are dangerous.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the citrine pendant still rotates clockwise, but at a faster speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no small danger, but it has not yet reached the level of demigod participation, let alone the king of angels... if it really involves the existence of this level He will certainly be able to detect and confront my divination... It seems that the "destination angel" Uluos will soon be brought out of Beckland... This means that the danger itself is more concentrated in Mr. X and his men belong to the category that I can cope with... As long as I don’t make mistakes, chances are great... Klein makes judgments, puts down the pen and paper, and returns to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Klein himself does not know what the "fool" corresponds to, there is any magical mark, so that the front and back sides must be consistent - according to the books of the spells he has seen, this also satisfies the occult rules, but the corresponding The power will be reduced, and the probability of failure will increase, because the existence of your praying is easy to think that you are not pious enough and respectful. Of course, this does not have any problems for Klein, and he will not dislike himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing the preliminary drawing, Klein found a metal vial and used the spiritual matching utensil to guide the mercury inside and fill it with the traces of the silver foil. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he only finished the front for a while, then summoned himself and responded to himself, bringing the bug with 12 transparent rings back. Room, place it on a silver sheet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, Klein adjusted the lower altar and stepped back two steps, using the ancient Hermes language to open:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupids who are not in this era..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed the process, completed the steps, and then went four steps. Entering the fog, accommodating the "Black Emperor" card, with its own spirituality to shake the little power of the mysterious space above the fog, responded to the prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the surging force poured into the aperture, Klein did not hesitate to return to the real world, seeing the altar become deep and dark, as if hiding innumerable The secret, and the silver flakes have floated up, and they are semi-fused with the "bugs of time". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the first two steps and flipped the silver sheet over, filling the symbolic lines on the back with mercury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A line will illuminate and glow with brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein quickly shrank his hand and watched the glory becoming more and more intense, wrapping the silver flakes and the "bugs of the time" in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the deep darkness of the altar was distorted, and the whole space seemed to be abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change flashed away, and a spell filled with singular patterns slowly fell to the surface of the desk, which was translucent and dark black, like Small cards made of special crystals, like the eyes of a certain presence, are watching the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful! Sure enough! Klein had a happy heart, and he picked up the spell and went to the cold, as if he had touched the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formation means success no matter what the final effect of the spell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein once again got a semi-god advanced spell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was busy for a while, bringing the finished product into the fog, and using the technique of "dream divination" to figure out the effect:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black crystal card-like spell has a single but powerful effect, that is, stealing the fate of others, and more accurately, the fate of grafting, the fate of the target after a while Grafted to yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplest case is, when the enemy is about to kill me, I use this spell to steal the fate of his success, and I will soon The fate of death is grafted to him, and then it will appear, clearly that he succeeded, but it is his own situation... in accordance with the consistent characteristics of the "stealer" route, but even more sinister is more terrible... this is From the stealing of money all the way to steal the fate... If the "bug of the time" is alive, and I can completely shake the power of the mysterious space above the fog, then this spell may even point to the time field... Klein While diverging my thoughts, I feel scared: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no fog blocking and "disinfection", without the help of this mysterious space, he can’t help any "The worm of time"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, now it’s mine...can’t call it “the worm of time”, just call it “snicker”...Klein again Busy, bring the "snicker" spell back to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handling the remnants of the ceremony, he solemnly placed the high-level spell in an iron cigarette case, with Azick copper whistle, Seignol gold coin Put it together and block and cut off with a spiritual wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
