			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas lamps at the ends of the stone bridge quietly shine on the road, but they cannot dispel the darkness below. Only the faint blush falling from the sky can barely illuminate the brown soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Destiny Member" hiding in the bridge hole, Rui Qiaode has not made a sound for a long time, so Klein could not help but wonder if the other party is too old and has passed away. - He guessed that the previous lucky failure was probably due to this factor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Klein tried to confirm the situation, Ricciard coughed twice and said: <br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a powerful adventurer who can seal the dice for a short time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The current situation is beyond my expectation, cough, me I was curious, what happened, and the luck I attached was not working at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very sorry, I can't come out, can't face you directly, otherwise I should be able to see something that other people can't see, even if they have High vision.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the speciality of the 'destiny' approach. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, is the problem on me? This is not the point, the point is that you have to give me the £700, no, 730 pounds... Klein’s heart While spitting, I couldn’t help but think of the orphan Ardemisol, the nicknamed "Monster" in Tingen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man who is slightly equal to half of the sequence 9, After seeing Klein, the screams fell to the ground, his eyes bleed, and he was afraid to meet the devil.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because he has the "wheel of fortune" approach The special, so I saw my problem and saw some things related to the fog. Unfortunately, the "Fate of Destiny" was quite serious. He brought his own bad luck and couldn't let him help him... Go back and ask Asked "Silver Snake" Will Anthony, he may know something, but this route is also very temperamental, he may not directly answer me, the probability is only a few vague and ambiguous Discourse... Klein maintains a state of no expression: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepare how to do? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You go to call Dirkwell, I am lucky for him to let him go to the casino to win money. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the name given to the hotel by Mr. Ricciard, Klein quickly found the fat pharmacist Dakwell, then carried the suitcase and the civilization stick. Muran looked at each other and continued to win in several big casinos. In the early hours of the morning, he gained 750 pounds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the last 730 pounds, Klein really realized a problem. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the reason for the lucky failure is on his own!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? "Klein swelled his bulging wallet, frowned, and said nothing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly thought of the invisible shallow grayish mist of his body. , vaguely understand the reason.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the promotion of 'no face', the fog and reality have a certain intertwined, not only can help me shield the essence is not too Strong proverbs, but also can undermine the influence of the fate imposed by others within a certain range? Therefore, the luck given by that Member could not work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to this logic, a certain degree of doom should not affect me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, what is this? Not only did I not become a bad luck, but also shattered my hopes of becoming a European emperor and a winner..." Klein shook his head and followed Dakwell and the owl back to Stone Bridge, telling him how to summon his messenger. Destiny Member, "Richard, let the other party get the news of the offensive magical item and convey it to the first time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do all this, Klein in Olavi The port city of the island found a hotel, opened a normal room and stayed there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White walked under the dark sky he liked, passing through the thick fog of November last year, and once again came outside No. 7 Pingster Street in the North District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorbell was ringing, his back was straight, and his chin waited patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard opened the door and looked at the handsome but rather annoying face, letting the road open and letting the other party enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still wears a white shirt and black trousers at home, but there are many sets of dark vests that are not buckled on the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is it considered?" Leonard asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem." Because it is not for his own money, Emlin has no bargaining ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even thinks that with the attitude of the other party’s last performance, bargaining will lead to price increases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard nodded lightly and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very rich."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell you, you are talking...Emlin snorted and replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is not a question you need to care about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he raised the small suitcase in his hand, opened and displayed the 7,000 pounds of cash inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard took out a stack and carefully examined it for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he took off the red gloves worn by his left palm and handed it to Emlin Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is the magic item you need, it can disguise itself in different colors.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is called 'fire type', which can enhance the user's charm and let him The words are extremely convincing, and they can steal an extraordinary ability of the target within 50 meters. The more you understand the target, the easier it is to steal the desired item, the more ignorant, the closer to random, and the luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the target sequence is higher than 6, there is a possibility of failure. The higher the probability, the greater the probability of failure.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After successful stealing, the original target loses that extraordinary ability, must be separated by at least 12 hours to recover, and the 'fire' master can use it skillfully for about 10 minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And it is expensive because its negative impact is small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quiet After listening to the other side's introduction, Emlin had a strong interest in the magic item of "fire", and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the negative impact?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard slid his hair and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One is when wearing it There is a small probability that the body will be lost. Second, after using it, one of its extraordinary abilities will be lost for at least 12 hours, but there will only be one item in this time range. In other words, even if it is used multiple times, Only one item will be lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The negative impact is really small compared to many seals I know." Emlin cleared his throat. , nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the "fire" gloves, carefully checked it, and then took out the stack of cash in the suitcase and put it on the coffee table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he put the gloves in the suitcase and did not carry them directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the suitcase, Emlin returned to the Harvest Church as before and entered the Priest Lounge, setting up a sacrifice ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious door of the illusion is opened, and the red gloves pass through the dark and deep void, and are about to enter the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is constantly evaporating and it is trying to maintain it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing this scene, Klein didn’t feel too surprised. After all, the old grandfather in Leonard’s body was the angel of the “stealer” approach. He may not do what he does. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been fully prepared for this, I believe that even if the other party has reached the level of Amon, he can clear the corresponding atmosphere and not let the other party Perceive the existence of fog, and thus start with the "moon" Emlin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick up the "Poseidon Scepter" placed in front of you, and Klein will let the blue-green "gems" shine at the same time. Start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, the silver above the fog is bright, a bunch of lightning is like a heavy rain, a little power carrying the fog, which has fallen into that little illusion People's faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face was screamed and utterly dissipated, leaving a dead translucent worm with twelve transparent rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The worm of time...but weaker than Amon..." Klein whispered, waving the red glove and the familiar bug at the same time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After careful identification, he confirmed that the worm and Amon were basically the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The grandfather and Amon of the poet classmate are in the same sequence, sequence 1? No, not necessarily, this may be just a feature of a previous sequence...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If, if it is sequence 1, consider that Amon is the son of the creator, the king of angels, maybe he also combines uniqueness, or another sequence of features. "Klein made a guess, but there is no way to prove it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for what the dead "bug" can be used for, when will spirituality be thorough? Dissipate, because he lacks the corresponding knowledge, he can only throw it into the pile of debris.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, 7 Pfister Street.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Mitchell sits on the couch with his eyes closed and his feet Resting on the coffee table, as if to make up for the night's waking with a short sleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, he suddenly opened his eyes and pressed down the voice:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;"What happened? Is there a real buyer of ‘fire?’ "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a slightly old voice in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I stayed The breath was cleared and completely completely removed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you find? Leonard retracted his legs and asked in a deep voice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old voice sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before I reacted, everything was over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I am at my own Good state, may be able to grasp the corresponding clues, but unfortunately, I have been weak for many years. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard was silent for ten seconds and shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When there is no such thing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, Klein listened to Emlin Pray, write down the magical information that the other person is telling, and turn over and over to check the glove called "fire".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, this way, my right hand glove Also have it. He laughed softly and said to himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After careful thinking, Klein gave up immediately to steal the "real creator" in the "All Black Eyes" Attempts to infiltrate the spirit, he wants to ensure success, and hopes to leave the opportunity to be able to deploy the "Master of the Secret" potion - according to the record of the Silver City, even without the use of fog shielding, this operation is no problem, and With the fog, there will be no more accidents, even if it is the spiritual pollution left by the “real creator.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
