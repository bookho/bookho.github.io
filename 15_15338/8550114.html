Old Neil wearing a black classical robe When I saw the note, I didn’t feel surprised. Instead, I seriously attached a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he smiled and added: "After all, you will go to the underground trading market with me tomorrow night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tomorrow's evening?" Klein didn't hide his surprise, and asked for confirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil nodded and sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a debtor Those who sleep peacefully always hope to return as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you were not this kind of performance, you have to use the ritual magic to solve the problem... It’s not only me who have procrastination, etc... Is it necessary to say that “I’m afraid I can’t help but use the money I have to pay back”? Klein did not expose the old Neil, and instead urged: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Neil, trouble you to take the corresponding information after the Chanis door." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arsenal is more about archaeological and historical documents, involving the extraordinary and hidden organizations, but not many, and they all belong to basic common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil slowly took a mouthful of handmade coffee, licked his lower lip, then picked up the signature and seal of the document and walked out of the arsenal, Klein Instead of him, guard here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, the old Neil of the black robe returned with a large stack of information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can only be read here, can't take it away." He put the information on the table and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein focused on his head, stretched out his hands, flipped the paper quickly, and made a holistic view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very detailed...it’s the internal information of the “Night of the Night”...It’s a church that has three or four thousand years, even longer history...Klein His eyes were roughly swept away, and his inner feelings were heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not only the introduction of various hidden organizations, but also many serial pathways, some of which are perfect, and some only write the corresponding potions of the sequence. Names, some only describe the extraordinary performance of the sequence, while others are completely missing, replaced with blanks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the excitement, Klein looked for the sequence of the "divination" representative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the flipping of the paper, he quickly saw the familiar words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his happy expression quickly solidified on his face, because the sequence 8 and sequence 7 behind the "Divination" did not correspond to the name of the potion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, at least the extraordinary performance of these two sequences... Klein breathed a sigh of relief, eased his mood, and carefully read those descriptions: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 8: The name of the potion is unknown, and the extraordinary person is good at skillful fighting, and it is very cunning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good at skillful fighting? Is this the advanced of the "Divination"? How do you feel weird... I am not a hunter... Do you want to be a melee-type wizard? What does deceit mean? Increased intelligence, good at blinding people? Klein looked at it one by one, and even suspected that the data of the night-time person had made a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a corresponding case, he repeatedly read it several times, but in the end he still did not find a reasonable explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze moves down, the description of sequence 7 is reflected in his pupil:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The potion The name is unknown, and the extraordinary person has mastered many spells that can be quickly applied, combining his own skills with supernatural powers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading the case of Sequence 7, he moved his attention to the summative description of this route:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sequence was first formed in the Chamon of the Solomon Empire. In the Quaternary dispute, the family was not completely destroyed. In the history of the Fifth Age, they were occasionally able to hear their names... It is suspected that there is a certain connection with the ancient organization 'Miscellaneous Society'." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zarato? Seeing this name, Klein's gaze was shrinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had this name in the remnant of Russell’s remnant that he got yesterday afternoon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell’s "playing the law" is a reminder of a mysterious character, Charato! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of the mysterious Charato, Russell the Great regretted not choosing the 'Divination'? So, indirectly affecting me, let me be ' The divination's, let the play back to the embrace of the 'divination'... It’s a bit of a fateful taste...” Klein frowned and felt that things seemed to have a different feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the logical chain, he believes that there is no problem in all links, but in the field of occultism, a similar sense of fatality often indicates something and involves some problems. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus the inexplicable feeling of crossing this thing... it’s confusing... and the guy I’m possessing is the note that was lost because of the “Mission” Only committed suicide... Kline thought for a long time, there are a lot of speculations, but there is no more information to prove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Repeatedly reading this part of the information several times, he finally can only press the idea and look at other records. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first found the "Sailor" sequence and found that it really belongs to the master of the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such an old opponent who may be more than two or three thousand years old, the internal data of the night-time person is recorded in considerable detail:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; &nbsp; "Sequence 8: 'The wrath of the people', the ancient name 'storm guard', when the anger of the extraordinary, can erupt beyond the normal many attacks, regardless of strength, or speed, will be greatly improved ... face They are like facing a storm..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 7, 'voyager', the ancient name "storm priest", the corresponding extraordinary is also astronomical Geography scholars have an intuitive grasp of the magnetic field, the ocean currents, the wind direction, and the clouds... The ships with 'voyagers' never get lost in the sea... they are the higher ranks of the ocean, they On the sea, you will get a full range of promotion..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are friends of water, free to move underwater for more than half an hour...they can Limited use of some water-related spells, some of which come from their own mastery Some gift from the Lord of the storm, such as ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; sequence 7" navigator "strong ah ...... Klein nodded thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suspects that "upside down" is not a "storm guard" or a "voyager". From the point of view of the other party's promotion, the latter may be very large. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also shows, on the other hand, that "upside down people" are not members of the "daily punishers", or pirates who are secretly absorbed by the storm church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, powerful... Klein turned back a few pages and found the "audience" progression, which was exactly the same as the description of "downside down" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "audience" of Sequence 9 is the same as the "Divination". It lacks direct means of enemies and can only grasp the truth of the other party by observing the information obtained by the target. Ideas, thus subtly influence, secretly guide, let things develop in the direction of their own hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "reader" of Sequence 8 is an overall improvement of the "viewer". His observations are no longer limited to the surface details, but to the gas field, the ether. The mysterious field of body and so on, the combination of the two allows the "reader" to grasp the hearts of the people with extraordinary accuracy, and seems to be able to read the other person's thoughts. In front of him, it is difficult to have a secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “psychologist” of Sequence 7 , which is the “psychologist”, takes a step further on the basis of the previous ones and begins to directly influence the target, for example, Treat the other party's frenzy and other issues, or make the other party become frenzied and lose their senses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
