			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Azick can see that I am extraordinary? His ability is really amazing... Kline snorted and replied calmly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it and added another sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of Welch and Naya."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, as I guessed it..." Azk sighed. "That time I came to the school to ask me and Cohen’s police, there are two who have extraordinary ability. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That should be the captain and Leonard, Welch's case is that they took over... Klein nodded invisibly, no interjection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick slightly raised his cane:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should have entered that circle I hope that you can help me find clues from my origins. This does not require you to do it deliberately. Remember to do it when you meet it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking here He has a bitter smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Besides you, other people with extraordinary abilities, I don't know... you can never imagine, one has no past What kind of emotions people have, it is like a ship drifting in the sea. The most terrible thing is not to encounter a storm, but to find a port, can not find a route to land, can only meet the disaster again and again. There is never an end, never feel calm and safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Mr. Azick, I can understand your feelings because I am the same People, fortunately, I have the memory fragments of the original Lord. I have Benson and Melissa... Klein answered silently and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Azick, why do you not have such a magical ability to enter a similar circle and find useful clues yourself?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick looked at Klein’s eyes and laughed at himself: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Because I am afraid of danger, I am afraid of death.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighs: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am used to my life, I like this life, I don't want to I don’t have the courage to take risks, I can only ask you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not say more, promised:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I can meet the relevant clues, I will pay special attention to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, we should go back to the office, wait for Cohen to finish." Things come back, go to lunch together, do you remember? The Dongbailang restaurant in the school is quite good, oh, I treat you.” Azke raised his cane and pointed at the direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, I really don’t remember when the university went to the East Bay Restaurant, even if Welch’s guests, he would refuse this. A relatively extravagant place... Klein pressed his hat and followed Azick back to the three-story gray stone building in the history department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps, Azk suddenly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things in school When I am busy, I will welcome my summer vacation. You can come to my home to be a guest, or write to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded, feel free Gossip: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Azick, I thought you would go to Desi Bay for a holiday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "No, the south is too hot now. I don't like the so-called sunbathing. You look at my skin color and it is easy to be tanned. In comparison, I would rather go to Winter County and go to Fossac. The northern part of the empire, skiing, watching the scenery, fishing seals." Azick smile with bronze skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to... The newly-born night-timer Klein reveals an envious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a few minutes before three in the afternoon, Klein packed up the items and sealed the bedroom with a spiritual wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, the majestic temple, ancient and mottled The bronze long table is quietly placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a thick gray mist of Klein sitting on the top, watching the still ambiguous justice and hanging people appear in their fixed seats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咦, Miss Justice’s mood is not stable, worry, uneasiness, and confusion... Klein, who opened the mind early, only noticed it Tarot will be the only female member of the anomaly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey Hall’s current mood can’t be described in words, and Su Shi’s sudden speech will give her a strong impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her predictions, the future development should be a big detective or a well-known psychologist, Miss Audrey, with her assistant big dog Su Shi, but if it becomes big Dog detective Su Shi with assistant Miss Audrey, then, some, some...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not some, that is very strange, people are overwhelmed ! Audrey suddenly sat up straight and wanted to ask for advice from Mr. Fool and the hanging man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She talked to her lips and suddenly swallowed back:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amount, how should this be? Q: What should I do if my pet is abnormal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you get along with a pet who has a good IQ and can speak?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, this is the Tarot Club, not a pet breeding experience sharing session. I bet I should ask, I am good in Mr. Fool’s and the hanging people’s minds. ! image directly broken "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; the idea of ​​Audrey Sharp, finally organize language: <br <br /> & nbsp />; & nbsp; & nbsp; &nbsp; "Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, always help my hangman, I have a question I want to ask, can a pet with extraordinary power help the owner to do something? Simply put, what can it do? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice fell, she found that Mr. Fool and the hanging man were simultaneously silent, and the atmosphere suddenly became a bit odd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, hello, you talk, don’t look at me like that, I don’t do anything! Really, I asked my friend! Audrey was ashamed to find a place to sneak in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She deeply regrets why she has to ask such questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with Miss Justice’s previous question about how the average animal took a sequence of potions, she shared her own potion by her own pet. ? This is really what Miss Justice can do... With such a member, my "cult" organization BOSS always feels cold... Klein raised his right hand, pressed his forehead, pinched it twice, and did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hangman Alger Wilson stunned for a dozen seconds, whispering in a strange tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This must look at the extraordinary ability of the pet, for example, it is 'audience', then it can replace you to observe and watch in some occasions, you know, people will be wary of the same kind, but not too It may be suspected that the pet is eavesdropping, even if the pet is at his feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes sense! Many times, when Dad and other nobles, parliamentarians, and ministers discuss important matters, they will avoid me and will lock the door of the study, but Su Shi will not be driven if he can avoid the initial removal... and those Madame and the ladies, I also like to communicate in a private circle. Audrey’s eyes are bright, and she immediately imagines:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Su Shi can now speak. You can tell me what it hears directly... Su Shi is awesome! I want to be good to you, I want to teach you to know the pronunciation of words and standards...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount is to teach Su Shi’s aristocratic pronunciation, or a normal Baker Rand, it will go out and say hello to other dogs, will it be heard, and so on, why should I consider this? It communicates with other dogs and does not use human language...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
