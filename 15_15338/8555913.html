Fols unclely cleared his throat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, just be it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What solutions do you have? What do I need to exchange? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger sneaked a glimpse at Mr. "Foolish Man" and saw that he had nothing to say, 遂 replied gently and slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to pay, because it certainly can't meet your needs. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for "Magician" and "Justice" to ask questions, he casually explained: "High sequence strong can decide whether to pass on extraordinary characteristics to The offspring, as well as the number of hereditary problems, Sequence 6 and Sequence 5 will naturally inherit part of it, not subject to its own control, although not too much each time, will not affect its own strength, but if your child is enough, you can still Let you go backwards. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does such children have a natural inspiration and a certain imperfect extraordinary ability? "Justice" Audrey was stunned and understood the source of some special people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hanging man" nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, they are equal to half of the sequence 9, with fixed characteristics. If you want to be an extraordinary person, you can only choose the corresponding path. Of course, similar people are not absolutely derived from heredity. It may also be eroded by the gods' ignorance or evil spirits. There are many factors that can cause the same impact. Also, children with high sequence strengths may have a sequence of 5, which is a very small number that can be improved. And it is not very likely to get out of control. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be..." Audrey sighed with satisfaction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come to her To say that knowing more mystery is more enjoyable than getting a good-looking dress or jewelry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Fols also has some insights, asks: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the extraordinary things in Sequence 7, Sequence 8 and Sequence 9? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In theory, their extraordinary characteristics are not passed on to future generations, but this is not absolute. If there are extraordinary characteristics, there is also a chance." Inheritance, that is to say, if you are pregnant with a child, you can effectively reduce the remnant of the potion in your body. No, one may not succeed, and three or four will grasp it even more. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, four? Fols is simply stunned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has long since Russell’s diary knows these common senses, and at this time he couldn’t help but think of a joke:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician", you can tell your child later 'You are drinking the potion'!!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although listening to the meaning of "inverted man", the moment of the burden, the burden can be reduced, but a child It’s almost a trouble for ten months, no, not only, it’s not just a matter of life... If you master the law, even if the follow-up becomes difficult, you can definitely re-digest it in two months, maybe it’s not so long. After all, it’s just the starting sequence... Folsie smiled and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand that the best way is to digest by playing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted Man" Alger gives a positive answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Sequence 7 And the following is the case. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a year and a half, two years and three years, five years and six years, giving birth to a child may be a simpler solution...he is in his heart Add a sentence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene is quiet for a few seconds, both ladies are digesting the knowledge just acquired.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;For the "Sun" Dairik, this is common sense, he adjusted the sitting posture: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was arranged to explore the mission again." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where to explore?" "Inverted man" Alger asked sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is still the temple of the semi-destroyed fallen creator." Dairik did not answer with dignity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like a certain security guarantee... "Justice" Audrey did not interject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted Man" thought for two seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Shepherd' elder also "Dungeon?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this way, the degree of danger is much lower than the last time, you can try it." "Inverted people" Alger couldn't help but look forward to " Mr. Fool’s glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failed to read anything from the other person’s vague eyes, he continues to the “Sun” Dairik Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This should be the last visit to you before the monitoring is completely removed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The message you passed before is that Amon and the fallen creator are Dead enemies, they do not hesitate to expose themselves, but also destroy the other party's plot. In the process of exploring the fallen lord temple, as long as you don't show any abnormality, the ‘six-member squad can basically assume that you are no longer affected by Amon. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hangman" is really experienced, just as he is planning this action... "The Sun" Dairik firmly remembers and asks Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to this, what else do I need to pay attention to? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the bronze long table, quietly watching the "fool" opened:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Flesh, proverbs. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gave only two words, and the rest allowed the members of the Tarot Club to comprehend themselves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the style of the big man.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hanging man" thought for a few seconds, thanking the "Sun" of Mr. "Footer" :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Specifically, don't look at it, don't listen, don't listen, don't eat, don't touch . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which are not supposed to be heard?" "The Sun" Dairik asked inexplicably.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted Man" sinks down the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;" After entering the temple, everything belongs to this rank. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So how do I explore? "Dyric stunned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hanging man" snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Are there other players? Isn't there a ‘chief’? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really is the style of "inverted man"... "Justice" Audrey subconsciously wants to reach out and face, but the education and habits engraved in the bones Let her know that this kind of movement is not elegant, so forcibly change the way, licking the falling hair and putting them behind the ear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." "Sun" Dairik feels that this method is somewhat unacceptable.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noticing his reaction, "downside down" Alger secretly snorted :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I mean, you listen to the 'chief' command, just do what he wants you to do, and the rest of the time, never give your own ideas. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huh, Alger breathed a sigh of relief and turned to look at the opposite lady: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Justice, I want to know the death of Duke Nigan, Beckland Political changes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey recalled the recent direct or indirect news:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The death of the Duke of Nigan has caused division in the House of Lords. Although his eldest son is about to inherit the title and become a member of the House of Lords, the prestige is not enough to quell the dispute.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nearly ten members of the upper house have jointly proposed that the nobility who has won the new title will also have a chance to get a fixed seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, let those who have been detained as nobles through political donations, charitable donations, and purchases of the corresponding land can become members of the House of Lords."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, "downside down" Alger laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Family has a certain history Aren't the nobles despising the guys who got the shackles on the wrong way? Their greatest pride is not the hereditary, fixed upper house seats?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Ignore the ridicule of the "inverted man" inadvertently, "Justice" Audrey quietly explained: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you have tens of thousands You will make the same choice when you have a pound, a tens of thousands of pounds, or even more debt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any money is not fatal for many nobles The threat, but the other party can apply to the court to use their land to pay off the debt, without the minimum land required for the title, the identity of their nobility It will be crumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And then?" "Inverted" Alger did not entangle the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey outlined: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This dispute has put many bills on hold, including However, it is not limited to raising workers' compensation, improving working hours and amending the "Poverty Alleviation Law". It is gratifying that the unified examination of government employees is still steadily advancing, and there is no stop. The investigation on the air pollution situation of Beckland is also deepening. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a short period of time, there will be no war..." "Put the man down" and whisper, and then exchange other situations with other members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worried that Klein, who was in doubt in the bathroom for too long, was behind them and announced that the Tarot would end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the room, Audrey was not in a hurry to get up, quietly I sorted out what I have to do after myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the mirror in front of her, playing with the ornaments on the earlobe, smirking and silently saying:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be a psychology course tomorrow afternoon, you can tell Miss Islant, I met a person who wants to buy a shadow in a circle of extraordinary people, and he promises to give an unusually rich reward. I don't know if there is any interest in psychological alchemy...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, Russell's diary and 'Wind' formula can't be forgotten...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, get the material of the 'psychologist' as soon as possible, Audrey, you can't be lazy! Su Shi is in sequence 8 and can't be caught up!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls took a few steps back and forth in the room and finally decided Determined to open the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found the stationery and pen, brewing for nearly a minute, and began writing to Dorian Gray. <br /><br />################################################################################################ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
