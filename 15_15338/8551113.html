No, the more people involved, the more likely it is to go wrong... um... maybe you can consider hiding the truth in the truth. The way that the doctor sees the expression and body language is the reaction of my real thoughts, but not all the ideas..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein side Listening to the detective Henry introduced Dust Guderian's situation, thinking about what method to use to maximize risk avoidance, and can not affect the achievement of the purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, he found inspiration from the police films and spy films he had seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well...you can try it this way, but you have to practice it again and again..." Klein nodded in his heart and put all his attention back. Detective Henry's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough..." Henry cleared his throat. "The commission of the red chimney, we are still going on, you should know that a similar building in Tingen There are quite a few, of course, if you can provide other clues, things are simple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein snorted and laughed:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I have other clues, I won't entrust you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, for so long The investigation and search made him pessimistic about the outcome of the matter, because the behind-the-scenes manipulator clearly noticed his divination and had plenty of time to transfer his hiding place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he only hopes to find further clues from the corresponding guest information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this value is 7 pounds...I want to think about it... Klein took the cane and said goodbye after the detective Henry described it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday morning, 8:40, Green Hull madhouse Inside the doctor's office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With gold-rimmed glasses, Dust Gudrian, who is superior in temperament, took off his coat, took off his hat, and hung them on the coat rack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just picked up the tin can filled with coffee powder and heard a loud knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please come in." Dast said not to care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he saw the half-covered door being pushed open and saw a young man wearing a black over-the-knee trench coat coming in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the other person’s strangeness, Dast’s doubts are open:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Good morning, you are ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closes the door, removes the hat, presses on the chest, and takes a ritual:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Good morning, Dr. Dust, please forgive me for taking the liberty to visit. I am the trainee inspector of the Ashova County Police Department, Kline Moretti, this is my ID and badge."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inspector?" Dast whispered, picking up the other's documents and badges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Special Operations Department..." He slowly looked up, his eyes calmed down to no awkwardness, as if he was looking at something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dast handed back the items in his hand and pointed to the chair opposite the desk:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please sit, police officer, what are you looking for?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat down, put his cane away, slowly picked up the documents and badges, and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Please allow me to re-introduced myself again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am also a member of the Tingen City Night Club, specializing in dealing with extraordinary factors "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, Mr. viewer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s not falling, he’s not Unexpectedly, Dast's pupils became smaller, the palms retracted, and a pair of people wanted to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police, I don't understand what you mean." Dast said with a strong support, almost unable to maintain the state, "I don't like this joke, Maybe I should call the guard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slowly took the revolver from the gun pocket and smiled at the same time:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Dust, I know that you can see my confidence, and I can see that I am not malicious. Oh, frankly, I am still somewhat uncertain, but yours The response gave me the answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above words are true... Klein silently added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dast is a little relaxed, and Yu Guang is aiming at the other’s revolver. He asks: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I have a hard time understanding why you came to me... I don't think I have exposed anything..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and said:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just an accident, perhaps fate to arrange for us to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, we have a dragon bar The underground trading market met, but you didn't pay attention to me at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"While you smartly buy the auxiliary materials of the serial potion separately, but Just for me to understand this formula, it is still worth paying attention to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dast suddenly vomited, as if losing the power of defense:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out to be like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought I was doing enough caution, I couldn’t think of it, I couldn’t think of it... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp; whispered a few words, he stared at Klein’s eyes: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police, I know you are not arresting me, you What is the real purpose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein relaxed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I and others Different nights, I don't think that every extraordinary person who does not belong to us is a potential criminal, which is unfair to those who yearn for order and kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dast changed his sitting position and said no more tightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If other nights, punishers, and mechanical heart members can Like you, the world is peaceful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know the night, the punisher, and the mechanical heart?" Klein pretended to be surprised. "This is not something that people who have entered the extraordinary field should know. There must be an organization behind you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned back and smiled at the corner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Psychological Alchemy? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, he leisurely looked at Dust's face a little ugly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;He began to discover that the "audience" status was not omnipotent, and he could see the purpose of the other party, but did not mean that he could figure out the specific details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krynn Mohan's revolving wheel:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doctor, we must communicate frankly This can start with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think that the unruly extraordinary is a potential criminal, but I agree to register and supervise every extraordinary person. This is a precaution against the risk of losing control and avoiding more serious and dangerous situations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not bother you in normal life, I hope that between us There is limited cooperation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Limited cooperation?" Dust seems to be thinking in the opposite direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled aloud:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, limited."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, report my status to me regularly, you know, many out-of-control incidents are possible when the situation is not so serious, and the night is There has been a lot of experience in this area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, in your organization, in the extraordinary people you know, if someone is about to endanger the innocent Please provide me with clues in time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, use something to exchange something that is more useful to you, this is the welfare for you, you should Know the meaning of welfare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, you don't have to worry anymore, no longer have to be afraid of being suddenly worthy of the night, the punisher and the heart of the machine. By arresting or killing members, you can enjoy your life safely and happily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will give you some proof of identity You can use it at the last, no other way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dast is silent, and then asks for a moment:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want me to betray my organization?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, not betrayal." Klein Chen said "This is a matter of righteousness, morality, and goodness. You are blocking certain evil, ferocious, bloody cases. Apart from this, I will not let you sell the secrets of your organization." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dast thought carefully and seemed to have gotten a little better because of the excuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He silently extended his right hand for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy cooperation."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shook hands with the unarmed hand and the other side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy cooperation." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doctor, can you tell me if you It is a member of the psychological alchemy club."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Dast nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who had opened the door without opening the door, did not find that the mood of the other party was fluctuating, so he asked: <br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you join the psychological alchemy club?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dast looked at each other's eyes:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of a patient in this madhouse, when I showed him a doctor, I found that he could see through me completely, and he was so lucid and sensible not like a madman..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is called Hood Eugen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein remembered the name, and Dast After a few words, I agreed on the secret delivery method of the meeting request and the location of the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
