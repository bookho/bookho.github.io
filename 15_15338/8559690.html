			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides of the ancient bronze long table are mottled, and the blurred figures stretch and grow in the cluster of deep red light, fixed, and the surrounding is as always Quiet, empty, it seems that for thousands of years, no souls have been invaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, 'Mr. Fool'" ~ "Justice" Audrey's light and pleasant voice quickly echoed in the magnificent palace propped up by the roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and daggered, watching the members of the "Justice" led by the simple completion of each other's greetings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, the "hidden" Jia De Li Ya is undoubtedly more silent, in the view of Audrey, the other side hides a lot of thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sound subsided, the members sat down, and the "fool" Klein first swept the "justice" and let the "psychologist" instantly understand his Meaning, did not raise the hand a small amount, spoke first, then looked at the "hidden" Jia De Li Ya, did not care as lightly: [br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You tell Bernard, she can exchange some things for some answers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berner黛...heard this familiar name, not the "mysterious queen", After the master of the "Dawn" or the leader of the "Elements of Dawn", Jia Delia realized that Mr. "The Fool" had everything, knowing everything, and his own careful thoughts could not beat him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made her mood more and more heavy, and it was difficult to contain a strong sense of fear. I didn’t know what kind of attitude and discourse should be used for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her opinion, the true meaning of Mr. Fool’s words is that he conveys this sentence, but he can only convey such a sentence. And can't even have any hints! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the meaning of this statement? Jia Delia thinks that she is very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berner? This is a common Intis female name. Who is it? What is the answer she hopes to exchange? What is the relationship with Ms. "Hidden"? Ms. "Hidden" made a private request. The answer to "Foolish" is "Yes"? No, this is not the case. Certainly it is not the case. If it is a private request or a reasonable request, Mr. "The Fool" will not specifically mention it in front of us, and respond directly to the "invisible" lady's petition...He Yes, tell? "Justice" Audrey forgot to observe other members, and a series of questions flashed in her mind. Then, with the keenness of the "audience" approach, she grasped the true intention of Mr. "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, she has some guesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. 'The Hidden' privately used a hint to reveal a little bit about the Tarot meeting to the lady Bernard, because the other Get some answers... 'Mr. Fool' is not too satisfied with this, so I directly pointed out this matter and gave the first offender a warning?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True, How can you disclose the things of the party to others? I didn't even talk about Su Shi! This will bring danger to everyone, but fortunately there is Mr. ‘fool’! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey almost forgot the image and etiquette education to drum up the gang, she first realized that not all members of the Talo Club have a sense of belonging to themselves. So worship and believe in "Mr. Fool".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger, "Magic" Firth, "Moon" Emlin also has Similar questions and guesses, but the focus of their respective concerns is not the same: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger is looking forward to what Mr. Fool will do, while thinking hard Bernardie, who is the name of the common Intis woman, why is it worthwhile for the "hidden" adventure to reveal a little information about the Tarot? Fouls is worried that the existence of the Tarot will be leaked out. At the same time, a story of spy and anti-spyware has been conceived in an instant; Emlin is sullenly watching and thinking that the "hidden" is simply stupid.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘿, even The ancestors of our blood family treated Mr. Fool with an equal attitude. Sending me this special envoy, accepting training, you guys who are not a god is actually trying to do small tricks under the watchful eyes of Mr. Fool. Is it too long? Is it true that I can’t understand some of the short-lived ideas? Russell the Great said that the worms that can only survive in the summer can't really know what the ice and snow look like... "Moon" Emlin gestures and sits relaxed, shaking his head without any disguise. < br br br br br br br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. "The Fool", who is Bernard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask! I thought that it would be Miss Justice to come to this place. Well, she seemed a little angry, so that she didn't want to talk for a while... Klein sighed and replied in an understatement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The eldest daughter of Russell,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The owner of 'Dawn',<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The leader of the element dawn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told Bernard’s identity one by one, let her be in front of the Tarot members No secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the "Dawn" owner replaced the "mysterious queen" is because Klein felt that "fool" could not call Bernard a queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of "Dawn"... "Mysterious Queen"! She turned out to be the eldest daughter of Russell the Great! Ha, "hidden", I can confirm that you are "star above" Jia Delia, the rumor that you broke with the "mysterious queen" is fake... "downside down" Alger is excited inside, only feel I have been suppressed for nearly three months, and the feeling of being cramped has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes him calm and can't help but laugh at the "hidden" sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Russell the Great said that those who play with the flames will surely burn themselves, and 'the stars will be 'you dare to challenge the insight of a god!'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Alger was quite fortunate. Fortunately, although he did some small moves at the beginning, he tried to figure out the identity, purpose and current state of Mr. Fool, but this does not involve outsiders, there is no leak, so Directly beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he introduced the "Four Kings" and the seven pirate generals, "Justice" Audrey and others slightly recalled and quickly confirmed Bell. Labuan is the "mysterious queen", a half-god of the five seas, and consistently surprised that the eldest daughter of Russell is still alive, lived to the present, and became a world-famous big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The answer to the 'Mysterious Queen' wants to be in the Russell Diary?" Audrey vaguely guessed the purpose of Bernardin before and after the matter and words. I think that the eldest daughter of the Great is trying to figure out the truth about his father being assassinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "hidden" Jia De Li Ya has recovered his ability to think, looking sideways to the top of the bronze long table, said without a fluke: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I made some mistakes, I don't defend myself, it's really a mistake.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mr. 'Footer', no matter how you dispose of me, or even kill me, I am willing to accept. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypothesis... If Mr. "fool" wants to punish you, can you still have a way to resist? "Put the person" and sneer at the opposite side. This simple word He heard the problem as soon as he heard it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. "The Hidden" is still a little scared... "Justice" Audrey comes from the side of the Guardian The subtle movements and words used in the sentence make the other party's implicit fear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her opinion, people who specifically want to be executed and are willing are often afraid Death in this regard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Magician” Foers found the stability from the calm and calm attitude of “The Fool” and thought that the situation of Tarot should not be leaked. Or, the leaked part doesn't matter, so she and the "Moon" Emlin, some curious and somewhat expectantly waiting to see what kind of punishment Mr. "fool" will make.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik still didn't figure out what happened and didn't understand Ms. Suddenly asking for punishment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, see Mr. "Foolish" Mr. briefly silence, "hidden" Jia De Li Yake to restless mood, slightly raise his head, Observing this existence after the thick fog without any trace, trying to grasp the other party's true intentions, in order to make a more accurate response, so as not to make mistakes, but also to anger, so that things can no longer be saved. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness of her black eyes is floating in mysterious meaning, seeing the gray fog and seeing the "fool".<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Jia Delia’s eyes were hot and there was illusory blood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
