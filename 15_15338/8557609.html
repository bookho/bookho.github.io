			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the real world, Klein extinguished the candle, put away the remaining items, and carefully checked the situation in the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately for him, the seawater whirlpool made by Cavitowan was completely cleaned up here, leaving only the rain and lightning that came out later. Part of the black, the sparsely populated ash and the gully that Klein plowed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traces are well resolved, let Deniz "wash" it with a fireball, pretending to be a pirate's infighting... Klein Micro No visible nod, draw out only one of the few paper people left, slamming the arm and shaking the wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper man flew out and burned himself, turning it into black ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, Klein stepped toward the door and frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His boots have lost their bottoms, and the rest are also ragged, and the trousers are also full of shattered, wet, burnt black and other traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that can’t be avoided in the previous situation, not the “paper man’s substitute” can afford – tearing the huge suction from the sea vortex, The feeling of wetness stems from the torrential rain from Cavitowa. The blackness is the sign that Klein used the "paper man substitute" and was hit by a small amount of lightning. Even now, he has calmed down and his right arm is also There are still some flaws caused by electric shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This body cost me 8 pounds 6 Soul... I have to re-match it... I am in danger of divination, I am ready, but I did not expect Cavitowa is stronger and more insulting than I expected... I hope there will be some gains afterwards.” Klein shook his head silently, convulsed his expression, endured pain, and came to block the exit door panel, and he slammed three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi has been a little nervous, hesitated for two seconds before moving the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Founding that Gilman Sparo has returned to a cold and introverted state, no longer exuding the hunger and madness of spiritual trembling, Daniz quietly breathed a sigh of relief Looked into the eyes and asked casually: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"End?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. Klein outlined the corner of his mouth, revealing Sven's smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet? Daniz was shocked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still, what else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Ryan maintains an implicitly crazy smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It also needs cleaning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is polite . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeping...Daniz groaned, raised his right hand and pointed at himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's mouth is getting louder and louder:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or is it me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be eaten by "squirming hunger"! Daniz laughed twice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"How to clean? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use the fireball. Klein replied succinctly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a part-time pirate, Daniz understood the meaning of German Sparrow without much effort. Over the other side, went to the inside of the warehouse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, he made a mistake in his heart, there is no small doubt:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The captain said that 'squirming hunger' devours a living person every day, but Gelman Sparrow only satisfies it after the end of the battle, usually not at all, and, just now Counting the battle, Galman Spallo also used the ice cold power of 'Steel' Maviti, but afterwards there was no 'food'... strange... What secrets are there? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A certain degree of seal? He, or is the organization behind him able to seal 'squirming hunger'?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Daniz "cleaned" the warehouse, Klein stood outside and looked at the dark clouds over the air, looking forward to the next thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron cigarette case with a foggy smell has been sent, waiting for the pseudo-"Poseidon" of Cavitowan to collapse and die... Hope The extraordinary people of the Storm Church and the Kingdom's military have either had time to find it, or left something they don't value but have some value... Klein took a slow breath and listened to a dull voice. Booming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a hotel, Alger stands at the window, staring out at the gloomy Sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after the end of the Tarot meeting, I got the anesthetic gas of the blood family, prepared to go out to sea, collect materials, and as a result, I passed away for a week. Yam... His mouth frowned and he shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first thing that has the "world" hunting "steel" Maviti, which makes him earn a lot, then he has to wait for the bounty, and the bounty has just arrived. He also encountered the collapse of the sea snake in Caviteu, and was asked to find adventurers and archaeologists such as Latsia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that in the investigation this morning, Latsia was found, and the "deceased" and the military seem to have grasped quite important clues. A few people went to Simim Island... Oh, this kind of thing will never turn to me... Alger took back his sight and pulled a short robe that didn’t pull his knees. He whispered to himself:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "End as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Cavituva is completely dead, the tsunami is no longer hidden, he can leave the port , leaving the "generous city" Baiyam, worked hard for the promotion sequence 6 "Winners". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the idea turned, Alger’s heart moved and turned to look out the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the high-altitude clouds flying away, and the blushing moon hangs quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slept in the middle of the night, suddenly woke up and vaguely noticed something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rolled over to get out of bed, came to the window and opened the curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blushing moonlight shines in. Frosty covers everything, cold and dreamy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s eyes cast out and found that the low-pressure clouds have disappeared, the high-altitude red moon is bright, and the comets are sparse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the confrontation between "Poseidon" and "Sea King" is over? Klein sinks for two seconds, retracts his gaze, closes the curtains, and walks four steps back into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat at the top of the mottled long table, with a gold coin, and a divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Cavituva has died completely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven times After that, he slammed the gold coin and watched it jump up and roll again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, this gold coin falls on Klein’s palm, and the king’s head is facing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that "Poseidon" Cavi Tuva has died completely! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the remains of the ancient elves of the island of Simim are closely related to the preservation of the existence of the Cavites. The party personnel just got the "Book of Natural Disasters" and knew that the relic information was less than 20 hours. Cavi Tuva could no longer support it... I thought it could survive for two to three days... Klein After a while, I tried to divination whether the official extraordinary has entered the Cavitewa hiding place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, due to the lack of corresponding information, he failed to gain divination and failed to gain any inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it, Klein changed his mind and solved the spirit. Divination himself is now dangerous to explore the Cavitewa hiding place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This involves himself and soon the results:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citrine pendant rotates counterclockwise, and the speed is not too fast, and the amplitude is not too large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is danger, can withstand...lower than the danger of the previous sacrifice ceremony... Klein nodded lightly, returned to the real world, began to act ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first locked the door of the bedroom, and then arranged a ceremony to summon himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-enter the fog, Klein directly picked up the "Black Emperor" card and put it into the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, he was so solid as if he had flesh and blood, and the black mist around him formed a very majestic look on the surface. The real body armor, but the head is a dark and gorgeous crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the leather gloves placed on the table, Klein hesitated to wear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, "squirming hunger" is almost sealed and does not dare to change, but as long as you leave here, out of control hunger will make it harmful Carrier, regardless of whether the other person is a living person or a spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein considers whether the high person of the "Black Emperor" card can suppress "squirming hunger" in the spirit and keep it normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try it, stop the call immediately, go back here... It takes almost no time, no danger... Klein picks up "squirming hunger" Wear it outside the iron black armor gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer hesitated, stepped into the "gate of summoning" and came to the real world with the inflated candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without negligence, Klein’s first reaction was to check the state of “squirming hunger” and found it calm and surrendered to the high level of the “Black Emperor” card. Under the grid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good... Klein breathed a sigh of relief, and in turn placed Azick copper whistle, biotoxin bottle, sun brooch and other magic items into the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally he picked up the black hardwood cane and was ready to use it to find the "lost" iron cigarette case contaminated with fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if you want to find the hiding place of Cavitowa, you must first enter the spiritual world and locate from it, otherwise it will only fail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how to enter the spiritual world, Klein did not consider the three methods provided by Mr. Azick, as a wise and thinking spirit. How can you not find the spiritual world and can't get inside? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmed down and looked at the pictures of countless balls of light. The mind and body were quick and quiet, the thoughts gradually became empty, the spirituality extended a little, and a little spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, he found that the surrounding is full of imaginary and transparent things that are difficult to describe the form, all the colors become bright and distinct but overlapping, gray The fog is so light that nothing is filled with nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths, at high altitudes, slowly swimming in seven different colors of clear brilliance, they seem to have life, there is endless knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the spiritual world, completely overlapping with reality, everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you happen to meet the "defective" or military personnel, I will end the call directly, returning to the fog... Klein takes a step forward Simple and simple to enter the spiritual world, I only feel that I am illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cloak behind him gently swayed, and the hardwood cane in the palm stood upright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a low degree of austerity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My own iron cigarette The position of the box."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the low mind, Klein is somewhat tight Because of the rich and distinct colors around, a pair of indifferent and strange eyes looked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seven times, Klein let go of his hand and wait for the revelation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hardwood cane floated up and floated unhurasly toward the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
