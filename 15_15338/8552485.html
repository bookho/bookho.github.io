			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground floor of the Church of St. Serena, the guard room outside the door of Chanis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Mitchell leaned back on the back of the chair, raised his legs and rested on the edge of the table, his eyes empty and without focal length. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after the treatment of ritual magic, his face is still very poor, just as the serious illness has just eased but has not yet begun to improve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the strong sent by the church is re-arranging the seal behind the door of Chanis, because of the loss of the ashes of Saint Serena, their opinions appear Contradictions, some people hope to use the new sacred objects to make up for the lack of power. Some people think that there is no need to be so troublesome. After all, for the whole night goddess church, the sacred objects are very rare and very precious. The idea they put forward is to lower the court. The positioning of the night market squad of the root market value, the items with the characteristics of living characteristics or seals are transferred to the quiet church of the headquarters or the Beckland parish, leaving only the easy-to-care part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They plan to take a telegram and ask the Pope to hold a meeting, which is decided by the Archbishop and the Senior Deacon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these arguments, Leonard has no feeling at all, he feels that he seems to be a living corpse, no pain, no sorrow, no excitement, no excitement Abnormally numb, not even willing to face other people, just want to stay alone in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He occasionally flashes some doubts, that is why the "murderer" only took away the extraordinary characteristics of Klein, leaving the captain of Dunn Smith. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒,哒,哒, footsteps echoed in the hallway, and Sika Thorn, who had a white bandage on his right arm, appeared at the door of the guard room. <br /><br />########################################################################################################## Things, if not members of the "Public Punishment" and "Mechanical Heart" arrived in time, if not the reinforcements sent by the Holy Church finally arrived, she would probably lose her life miserably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, the old internal caretaker failed to stick to the end and died in his post. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leonard, I found the captain, there is a telegram in the captain’s office that has not been decoded yet. It should have been from the previous church." Part-time writer West Ga. Turner said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard’s green eyes turned a bit, and the whole man finally came alive. He vaguely remembered that he had heard the new telegram entering before, but at the time The battle was on the verge, and neither he nor Klein had the heart to pay attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the content?" Leonard found that his voice was abnormally dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white-haired black lady, Siga Thorn, replied without hesitation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Beware of Ings Zangweier, be careful of the seal '0—08'.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ince Zangweel, the archbishop of the defect, failed to advance The 'gatekeeper'... seal '0-08', a feather pen that looks very ordinary..." Leonard whispered the memory he could dig, and immediately turned his side to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly narrowed his eyes, and his body and disappointment disappeared at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out to be like this..." Leonard took back his legs and stood up, as if there was a flame burning inside the green eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks at Siga.Tang Dao:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I intend to apply to join 'red gloves' '."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red Gloves" is the name of the elite team inside the night. In general, the night squads are stationed in the local area, each with jurisdiction. Without permission, the criminals cannot be pursued outside the jurisdiction, and some evil guys always shoot for one place, which causes a lot of inconvenience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, the Goddess Church has set up "red gloves" inside the night-timers. They are strictly selected elites and even master some of the holy things. The task is to reinforce the signaled night squad, as well as to unrestrictedly track and arrest the evil ones that are being watched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Red Gloves’? But their minimum requirement is Sequence 7... and the danger of ‘Red Gloves’ is double the ordinary Night Squad.” Siga Thorn’s doubts said with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard outlined a smile without a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can almost be promoted "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyelids turned cold, gnashing his teeth and silently saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want revenge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ins. Zangweier, you must live to wait until I am strong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." Siegar seemed to guess Leonard’s thoughts and sighed, "Our team members will have half or more new faces. Even if it is a night squad, such a tragic seldom is rare..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard’s eyes are dark and bite the lower teeth:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Handle the corpse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Seaga micro invisible nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard slammed into the doorway:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will inform their family." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to face the scene I don’t want to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2, Narcissus Street, Melissa sat on the single sofa, repeatedly studied the three tickets in her hand, studied the above text, and studied the printed date and seat number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson sat on her side, smiling at the focused sister, and her body posture was very relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, they heard the sound of the doorbell being slammed, jingling, and jingling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa glanced at the busy maid Bella in the kitchen, holding the three tickets at the same time, got up slightly in confusion, and ran in a small step. To the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her black hair is much more moisturized than before, her face is no longer thin, more beautiful blood, brown enamel is more brilliant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning the handle and opening the door, Melissa snorted because she didn’t know the visitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a young man with a hairy tourmaline. It looks good, but his face is very pale and his eyes are full of sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me, are you?" Melissa asked confusedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard draped a black formal suit outside the white shirt and replied in a dumb voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a colleague of your brother Klein."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa’s heart suddenly stunned and instinctively looked out behind Leonard’s But nothing was found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice inexplicably asked a little trembling:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard closed his eyes and took a breath:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, your brother In order to save some people, Ryan died in the hands of a fierce criminal. He is a hero, a true hero."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa's eyes are a little bit 睁Big, the body shook a little invisibly, and the three tickets in the hand could not slide down to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They face up, with the name of the drama "The Return of the Earl". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Moretti's living room, Leonard barely dared to look across the Melissa and Benson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his mind is always involuntarily flashing over each other's appearance:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is full The youthful girl squinted, not saying a word, the pupil has no focal length, and it is quiet like a doll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who is somewhat similar to Klein tries to maintain a normal posture, but he always makes a fuss from time to time, and his speech will be slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case. I am sorry about this. I have not been able to stop it in time. The Black Thorough Security Company, the police department and those who have been helped promise to you. A pension, about 6,000 pounds..." Leonard said with a slight sway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Banson interrupted his words and asked in a hoarse voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What about his body? I asked Klein's body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed his lips and paused:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When can we see him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the company, you can do it now." Leonard is sadly saddened Reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Banson pulled his stiff corner and said, "I will go to the bathroom first."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to wait for Leonard's response, he quickly entered the washroom on the first floor and slammed the wooden door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going to the vanity, Banson unscrewed the faucet and let the tap water drop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bent down, buried his head, holding the water in his hands, and constantly patted his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pat was patted, his movements suddenly paused, and for a long time there was no change, and the sound of the water in the entire washroom was echoing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few tens of seconds, Benson looked up and looked at the mirror, only to see the opposite face of the water, the eyes were red It can't be covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, the corner of the Raphael cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ending Dunn’s funeral, the crowd gathered in front of a new tombstone with black and white photos of Klein and a very rich picture of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa stood in front of the grave, her eyes were scattered, and there was no focal length. Elizabeth, next to her, was always tearing her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard, Benson, Frye, and Brett took the coffin and walked over and placed it in the grave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the priest’s rumors and their respective prayers, Shashasha, the soil began to be buried, and the black coffin was hidden a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Melissa halfway down and threw the copper whistle that was found in her brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard looked at this scene sideways, my heart was very sour, and I admire the girl’s strength. After knowing the bad news, she never kept crying. Silence makes people feel bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grave was filled and the slate was covered. Leonard finally looked at Klein’s tombstone. His epitaph had three lines:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Best brother;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Best brother;"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Best colleagues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sad atmosphere, the people of Blackthorn Security Company gradually left, Selena and Elizabeth I also quit under the urging of my family. Only Benson and Melissa were left at the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
