			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already got the 'King of Knowledge' formula from the oldest organization. Now, it is time to seek the corresponding materials, it may already Belonging to an angel, perhaps combined with the things around him, turned into a horrible monster or chaotic horror '0' seal. In short, you must be careful enough to find the right helper.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Knowledge Emperor', the name of this sequence of 1 potion is really interesting, if you don't directly read '亵渎石块', I would think it belongs to the 'reader' way, It is even more strange that the two churches belong to the 'God of Knowledge and Wisdom' relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have discussed this matter with the mysterious leader and the old Mr. Hermes. We basically reached a consensus that the 'reader' approach represents It is the 'omniscience' in 'Esoteric Almighty', and the 'Peaceful' and 'General' are the knowledge itself, which belongs to two aspects, one is more mysterious and the other is closer to reality.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, when I became a 'Knowledge Emperor', Bernardin would not have to worry about the indoctrination of the 'hidden sages', nor the fear of chasing knowledge. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great finally turned to the "sneak peek" way, I don't know if he has successfully become a "knowledge emperor"... Perhaps because of this matter Only then did he break with the steam church, so that he could not find a helper in the world, and he hoped that the "Twilight Hermit Society"... Klein was half-sensational and speculative.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, he is very interested in the idea that the Emperor explained that the "reader" approach cannot be interchanged with "the glimpse of the sneak" and the "generalist", and that it is deepening, perhaps You can find the rules and principles of extraordinary path interchange.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the eyes of ordinary extraordinary people, 'readers', 'sisters' and 'passes' Sensers' belong to the field of 'knowledge' and should have a strong relationship with each other. The result is a heresy...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Reader' belongs to 'omniscience Almighty' The 'omniscience' in that, the 'secret person', that is, the 'shepherd' approach, is the 'all-rounder' in the 'omniscience Almighty' Then there is a certain intersection between the two, for example, because of erudition and versatility, because of versatility and knowledge, so they can be interchanged...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this perspective, the 'storm' approach to the sea, land and air omnipotence can be understood, and the 'spectator''s corresponding spiritual field is a powerful complement to the 'storm'. So why can 'the sun' be interchanged with them? Considering that the previous omnipotent omnipotent title is the ancient sun god, does it mean that ‘the sun’ is the cornerstone of ‘the omnipotent omnipotence’? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm... According to this line of thinking, 'sneak secrets' and 'generalists' are different aspects of 'knowledge' itself, so they can be exchanged, So what is the differentiation between 'Assassin' and 'Hunter'? 'Black night', 'Death' and 'God of War' route?” Klein thought a lot, but there was neither time nor enough information to analyze it in depth. I can only temporarily put the corresponding questions behind me, and use the idea to get the third page diary up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a glance, Klein’s spirit suddenly concentrated because the current diary is very different from the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has no date, the word spacing is very large, because it is the original version, it is also obvious that the weight of the pen is extraordinary! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s gaze, the content on the yellowed paper is reflected in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No! Impossible!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could this be! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If my guess is not wrong, there should be more than one in the first place!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not! Do not! How could this be! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What I saw was telling me that everything would be destroyed, and everything I created was the same! No! I don't accept this ending!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must try to save yourself, no longer send fantasy to the Seven Gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only the throne of the sequence 0, myself and those I value, can be saved!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I am trying to pull Mr. 'Gate' back to the real world? No! Although he claims to have only sequence 1, I think that he is by no means an ordinary sequence of 1! It is likely to bring me unexpected. Disaster outside!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese characters that are a lot bigger than the previous two pages occupy the yellowed paper in a sparse and messy manner. The actual content is not much, but it seems that Klein’s head is bursting with pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When writing this diary, Russell is probably already the "Knowledge Emperor" of Sequence 1, and his content written with intense emotions has a strong Mysterious, that is to say, if Klein reads these things in the real world, it is likely to be mentally disordered, mad on the spot, and even out of control! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Ms. "Hidden" does not understand Chinese, otherwise she has already mutated when she forcibly remembered the content... even if she doesn't understand, she should feel special Tired, consumes a lot... If you have long-term contact, long-term gaze, auditory hallucinations and hallucinations are inevitable, and there is a high probability that there will be signs of loss of control... Klein feels fortunately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His attention quickly turned back to the diary itself, and doubts emerged:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great What did you see, so that his emotions were so intense, and his attitude was a bit more extreme?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, the sense of excitement and impulsiveness between the lines is a bit abnormal, not In line with the character of a long-time high-ranking person, it does not conform to the personality of an angel. Even in the last days, when the emperor said that after the death of a flood, he did not have such a state of disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who was it affected by it? Or was it contaminated or eroded by something?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes, he mentioned that there should be more than one of them, what does it mean? Crossing? When I was on the earth because of inexplicable things and things, really more than one, and me...even more? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One by one flashed, and Klein didn't waste time, letting the three-page diary disappear, with a smile on the "hidden" Jia De Li Ya: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thinking about the request? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia Delia had prepared for a ceremony and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think Know why Rosen the Great was crazy in his later years. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same row of "justice" Audrey squinted and suspected that she had misunderstood, she did not expect that the "hidden" lady opened her mouth. Heavy problem.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how does she know that Russell’s emperor was crazy in her old age? Also, she only submitted a three-page diary and asked this The problem of level is not in line with the law of equivalence exchange! Audrey has a variety of ideas in her heart, but she has not stopped the question of Ms. "Hidden". Instead, she is very interested and inexplicably excited to wait for Mr. "Folk" to respond. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Upside down” Alger, “Moon” Emlin, “Magic” Firth also held his breath and turned his eyes to bronze At the top of the long table, only the "sun" Dairik and the "world" don't care much about it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Footer" Klein thought about it, chuckled One channel: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, we determine a fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not omniscient, nor omnipotent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said with a self-deprecating ease This sentence came out, but the "hidden" and others did not have any abnormalities, and even acted more respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For them, it is obvious that Mr. "The Fool" is not omniscient or omnipotent, even if they do not mention their respective speculations about the state of "The Fool", it is only This hidden reality does not have a similar description of the reality, which is enough to illustrate this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, at present, all true gods and evil spirits do not have the name of the omnipotent all-powerful type! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a good foundation, Klein began to answer the question of "hidden":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also want to know what happened to Russell in his later years.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is now certain that Russell will be motivated or influenced by some unknown cause. The gaze is directed to the sequence 0. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't explain what the sequence 0 corresponds to. In the Tarot Club, I know more than I don't know, and I don't know if I can guess it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
