			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s bad! Controlled by puppets! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captains are either in a coma... or they haven’t slowed down yet, they can’t even get up... It’s too late... wake me up...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No... must... save yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s eyes have turned into a slow motion of the last life, and the joints and brains used for thinking seem to be pouring into more and more glue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no interest in becoming a live-action puppet, seizes the opportunity that has not been completely controlled, and strives to find a way to save himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play yourself...Sure... No... Must... External force...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External force... ...Try it... It’s too late to delay, and I can’t think too much. Klein grabbed an inspiration in two or three seconds, driving the “rusty” knee joint and taking a step counterclockwise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he did not try to break away from the invisible rope that "snapped" his throat, only silently in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fusheng...Xuan Huang...Xianzun......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to use the mysterious world above the fog to wake himself up and get rid of Assimilation of the seal "2-049"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Kline’s knees and ankles are both squeaky and squeaky, with a slow, distorted posture, and a counterclockwise step:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fusheng...Xuan Huang...Tianjun..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts are getting more and more stagnation, Klein Just like all the family buckets and all the security guards' computers, one card and one card lifted the left foot and moved to the established position:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fusheng... Xuan... Huang... Shang... Emperor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts in Klein’s mind are becoming more and more rigid, more and more stagnate, and only instinctively Going out of the last step. At this stage, he knew that he was almost completely under control, even though Al-Hassen got up in time and ran to save, it is estimated that he could not complete the wake-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the strong desire to survive still lets him meditate on the last mantra:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ......Life... 玄......黄............天..................尊.................."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meditation just fell, the confusion Extremely crazy to the extreme shouts and whispers screamed, and then rushed away Klein's solid thoughts, leaving it fragmented and turned into one uncontrollable thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s mind turned into a pot of boiling porridge, and he felt the “body” lighter and spiritually flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boundless gray mist and the deep red stars of different origins are once again in front of his eyes, empty, mysterious, fuzzy, and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein’s confusing ideas quickly precipitated, and finally restored the ability to think and saw the grand temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calling...is useful." He whispered in fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to previous observations, he understands that once he is deeply involved in the control of the seal "2-049", it is basically equivalent to death. Normally, there is no drug. The solution can be saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, his "transportation ceremony" and the mysterious world above the fog are not in the normal range! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps back and forth, Klein began to think about the current situation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't always Stay here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The present 'I' should only have flesh, and it will be like a living dead than a living dead..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you venture back, you can't be safe... In case it is controlled by '2-049'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idea In the crowd, Klein suddenly took a shot on his forehead and whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that I have not really adapted to the identity of the 'divination'!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not fallen, his figure has appeared on the top of the bronze long table, sitting on the high back chair with odd symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stretched his hand and picked up the pen that appeared in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brushing brush, he wrote a paragraph on Unreal White Paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Return to reality The world is very safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Klein took out the projection of "spiritual pendulum" from his pocket - after several gatherings, he found that It is the item on your own that can be projected onto the fog, but it will be relatively illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding the silver chain in the left hand, Klein let the citrine pendant nearly touch the paper and touch the "event." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swing subsides, he closes his eyes halfway, and his mind calmly recites the words on white paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Returning to the real world is very safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Returning to the real world is safe "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and over again, Klein uses a complete "spirit without a reduction The pendulum method has been divined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes opened, and he saw the pure citrine pendant swinging slowly, causing the silver chain to rotate clockwise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clockwise is for sure, counterclockwise is negative... It’s safe to return to the real world... Klein breathed a sigh of relief, habitually collecting the silver chain, then, He unfolds his spirit, wraps himself, and simulates the state of falling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;朦胧 The fog and the crimson stars are flying fast and illusory, and Klein soon saw himself staying in the same place and saw half of it. The brown puppet, hanging from the iron box, found that the seal seemed to stop all movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perception of the body is coming to mind. He is waiting for his arm to confirm his state, and suddenly there is a voice hidden in the wind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to be awakened? As long as you promise me something, you can be saved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is to help me pick up the notes of the Antigone family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agree and nod, I know that you can still Complete this action."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who? Well, "2-049" doesn't seem to try to control me anymore... Also, it doesn't affect the same person continuously, there will be gaps... Klein is shocked, but the surface is not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the voice added a few more words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing this, you will receive additional rewards. I know that you are a 'divination'. I also know that the Church of the Night Goddess has no subsequent sequence 8, and we can give you a secret meeting."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, frankly, I used to be a 'divination', otherwise I wouldn’t dare to return. In order for you to see my sincerity, I will tell you now. The sequence 8 corresponding to 'Divination' is, 'Clown'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not expect that the "Divination" would be associated with the "Clown". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to form a circus giant? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, make your decision, believe me, you have not had much time to waste." The voice once again came with the wind, far Dunn and Lorotta were still in a coma, Bolgia seemed to be very hurt, and there was no movement, and Al-Hassen and Leonard Mitchell were relatively good, trying to stand up and sit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are you looking for me? The secret meeting... is that tuxedo clown? After he ran away, he quietly returned, trying to get a cheaper... But why should I ask for help? He can now deal with everyone here... Hearing the other's words, one doubt suddenly flashed in Klein's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the other person said that he was a "diviner", Klein began to try to analyze it in the style of "divination":<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He dares to return, it must be divination out of 'hope', believe that monster Bieber will be destroyed, I believe we will suffer heavy losses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "He doesn't go to take the note himself, not directly against us. It should be a divination. This is a great risk, so I suspect that the captain and Ms. Louluta are pretending to be unconscious. I suspect this is for him. The trap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He doesn't have more divination, doesn't confirm my current state, one may be because time is too late, wait, Ayr. Mr. Hasen can restore a certain amount of combat power, and the second is to despise me and think that it is not necessary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He knows very well about 'Divination' and must believe that I am getting rid of Can't control the puppet... He is taking me as a cannon fodder to test the trap..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This explains from another aspect that the external performance of the 'transportation ceremony' is almost no abnormality..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no stagnation in the brain. , roughly grasped the idea and purpose of the tuxedo clown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the other party’s promise, he does not believe at all, “cannon fodder” has no human rights! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts flashed quickly, and Klein took control of his neck, and it was a bit difficult to make a living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While making this move, he really confirmed that he had got rid of the control of the seal "2-049". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just finished the end, two or three meters away from the side, there was a transparent "curtain" to shake the outline, wearing a tuxedo, face painted clown oil The figure is the member of the escort who escaped before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Klein’s attempt to save the "2-049" range because he turned back in the opposite direction was against the iron black box and back to the The puppet, the tuxedo clown is in front of his side, one is away from the seal, and the other is to avoid his muzzle, which is quite cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tuxedo clown took a long piece of paper from his pocket and jerked it a bit, shaking it straight and shaking like a stick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the "wooden stick" and, across the distance of two or three meters, poked at Klein's shoulder and tried to wake each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy knows very well about "2-049", knowing that there is a place where the descendants of the Antigonus family have a breath, the puppets will be violent and will control at the same time. Two people... He also knows that using a stone scorpion seems to have no effect? At least I didn't see the captain. They had a similar attempt before... Klein didn't understand why the "2-049" follow-up didn't try to assimilate himself, but he didn't dare to stay too much within five meters, so he raised a heart. Waiting for the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper stick turned into a wooden stick just about to touch his shoulder, and Klein’s left hand suddenly lifted up, grabbing the top of the “wooden stick” and jerking Pull back later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tuxedo clown was caught off guard, the body was pulled directly, and it was smashed forward, and the distance between Klein and the Klein was shortened again, less than two meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Klein had already prepared his right finger and pressed the trigger of the revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
