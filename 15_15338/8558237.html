			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the evil spirit be the "red angel" Medici, the one who once served the "creator" of the king of angels, and the founder of "redemption rose" ? Klein instantly produced such a association and pushed back to find traces and clues:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The former holder of the 'Red Priest' card, because of some sort of The degree of attraction came to the underground palace and died beside the descendants of Tutu;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evil spirit I saw in my dreams, before my death It's easy to kill a powerful dragon;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It knows the potion formula of the 'heterogeneous' route sequence 4' puppet, even more;<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is very clear about the 'redemption of roses';;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"from the world after the Cataclysm The Church of the Righteous God does not know that the former Binxi's current Banxi is inhabited by the descendants of the Medici family, and the evil spirit can give corresponding hints."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is the "red angel" Medici's death may be very large... and an angel king will be killed by the "blood emperor" Alista Tutu, does this mean the latter? Has Beyond the sequence 1, reaching the sequence 0 true God level, can not be directly looked at...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil spirit said that the late Quaternary, the Solomon Empire The "Black Emperor", the "Blood Emperor" of the Tudor Empire, and the "Night Emperor" of the Trentzost Empire are fighting for the position of sequence 0 until Arista. Figure is crazy... Does this mean From that time on, the "Blood Emperor" is a true god of half madness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, Mr. Azick also mentioned in his letter that he was glanced at the "Blood Emperor" Alista Tutu and lost consciousness. At that time, he was at least the demigod of the sequence 4. The "blood emperor" was so powerful that it could only be explained by the level of the true god...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Az In that letter, Mr. Ke also described the true "black emperor" who came back from the resurrection, saying that he was sitting on a huge throne and looking down at the whole earth... "Black Emperor" can come back to life, with a high probability of sequence 0 True God... If this is the case, the "Four Emperors Battle" is much more high than I thought before. It is no longer just the position of the three sequence 1 competing for sequence 0... Klein will link many things before and after, for the Quaternary History has a new understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, many questions have emerged:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the old evil spirit It is really the 'King of Angels' Medici, the underground palace is likely to belong to the 'blood emperor' Alista. Tudor, then why are there two thrones side by side, why there are six human beings Statue?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is the half-mad 'blood emperor' killing the 'red angel' Medici? After He became the sequence 0, which position did he occupy? First of all, you can exclude the 'black emperor'...will not be the 'red priest'? Killing the King of Angels Medici is for the extraordinary characteristics of the other side? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can 'Red Priest' and 'Black Emperor' are not similar ways to replace each other, the former I can almost certainly be a pair with the 'Witches' route Well, the captain said that when taking the potion of other ways, the first time will not die, the big probability is crazy, and the distorted terrible strange power is obtained, which is in line with the 'blood emperor' semi-mad Traits!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was in the last step, because the position of the 'Black Emperor' and the similar path has no hope, the most insane choice, at the expense of half-madness, Going to other ways that are completely okay? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is also a problem, the promotion of 'Red Priest' needs to kill the Angel of the King Medici, but before the promotion, Arista. I can't do this myself, unless, unless there are more sequences 1 to help him, or the true god of sequence 0..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of it, Klein The mind suddenly flashed through the statue of the statue in the underground palace:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue of the night goddess with the moon as the pillow, the statue of the earth god with the baby, and the lightning The statue of the Lord of the Storm, the statue of the handsome and eternal eternal sun, the statue of the god of war in the throne of the sorghum, the statue of the god of knowledge and wisdom wearing a hood, and cast a cold gaze from the dark room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he clearly remembers that the Six Gods supported the Terencer Empire, not the Tudor Dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the history of the Quaternary, the more confused it is, the more horrified it is... Klein sighs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you thinking?" Azke Aegs noticed his pause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was just thinking, since 'Red Angel' Mei Dicky fell to the hands of the 'Blood Emperor', Alista, Tulu, as early as the Quaternary. Who is the 'God of the Weather' in the past few hundred years of the Banxi Port?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The exceptions they showed were from..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of here, Klein came to an abrupt end, Because the things in Banxi are different from what he imagined.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that there was a "red angel" Medici there, and he did not expect the other party to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the secrets hidden in the lime restaurant and the telegraph office are even more difficult to guess, and there is no way to infer the source. The more you think about it, the more fearful it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The evil spirit prompts 'Bingxi Town', will this have been expected, is this itself a step to get rid of the seal? Do you want to tell Mr. Azke about this matter and see what opinions he has? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, let the Miss Magician in Beckland pay attention to the area to see if there is any abnormality. If not, just wait for me to return. Beckland, contacted Miss Sharon, and asked her for advice, then told Mr. Azke. After all, it is the relics we explored together, and we must respect her ideas. If there is an abnormality, then it can only be rushed. ..." Klein quickly made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick heard his question, haha ​​smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t think again These things, they must have been buried by the storm church, forced to explore the reasons, but will bring great danger, even if the angel level is reached, there is the possibility of degeneration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of occultism, curiosity is often the main cause of death... Klein thought of one thing that has been experienced and heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Azick, I already have my own messenger "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s faster than I thought," Azk said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein then simply talked about how to modify the mantra, how to complete the summoning, how to encounter the strange spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When summoning spiritual creatures, it is not a corresponding occupation. It is true that similar things will happen. It is necessary to try again and again to get the desired result, but In the process of repeated trials, it is easy to encounter danger. Even if you add a description such as 'friendly', it is not absolutely safe. The spirited creatures summoned to you are not malicious to you, do not want to hurt you, do not represent its own existence. It won't harm you, maybe it's just the air that comes with it, it will make you rot into blood." Azick smiled after listening to the "rapid person", "weak presence" and "resistance" examples. A few words, at the end, asked, "How did you succeed in the end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean is not too embarrassed to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I changed the last sentence to 'willing to be the unique existence of my messenger'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick stunned for a second, weirdly I saw Klein at a glance:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This description is too broad, normal will not "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I was extremely lucky..." Klein carefully described his messenger's appearance, not even concealing the other party's request for gold coins. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick recalled for a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...well." Klein wanted to say that there was nothing to drive her except the letter, and I remembered the scene when I was fighting Mr. A. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was silent for a short while, and Klein took the subject back on track:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Azick Sir, when do we leave for the Black Death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer the delay, the more likely it is that the traces left on the Black Death will be in daily cleaning. Was removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now." Azick stood up and put on a top hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is neatly dressed and is looking for an excuse to go to the bathroom for divination. The action is tonight, but Azick grabbed his shoulder and brought it directly into the spirit. boundary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the layered color block and the almost invisible figure, he heard Mr. Azke say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Begin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So straight? Do not need to confirm the situation? Perhaps Daxie has already used his own method to weigh the danger... Klein silently sighed a few words, picked up his cane, and divined his whereabouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cane flew on its own and rolled forward toward the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick followed Clean and walked easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn’t take long, the black hardwood cane paused, and the front was full of black and overlapping shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through this abstract picture, Klein vaguely recognizes that it may symbolize the black death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Azick’s figure paused and his tone was slightly dignified:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The spirit here tells me that there is danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangerous? Can Mr. Azke feel dangerous? "Illness in the disease" has found a helper? The top of the witch sect? Klein Horan frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- He is fully convinced of the judgment of Da Yu, because the sequence 7 of the "Death" pathway is called "Psychic" and is promoted to the level of the demigod. The performance is very normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azke half-closed eyes for two seconds, immediately opened the way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s not big, let’s go in.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is not big... For you, it’s probably like this... Kline’s mouth is slightly pumped and he decides to change his appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, even if you can’t beat it, you won’t be found on the door! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, Klein has a unique wide chin and dark green cold eyes, followed by a brown ancient warrior hairpin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pretended to be the former owner of "squirming hunger", "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qilingus! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick glanced at him, and the scenes around him suddenly had a feeling of falling, and the vivid colors faded away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just blink of an eye, Klein found himself back to the captain's room of the "disease girl" Trey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flamboyant female pirate is wearing another white shirt with obvious marks on the left shoulder. The black hair is circled and no longer flattering. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the sudden "visitors", she did not panic, and even smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a feminine female voice is difficult to distinguish the position, like the left like the right, like the former:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
