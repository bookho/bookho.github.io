			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver bullet crossed the distance of a few meters and accurately penetrated the neck of the tuxedo clown, and the large blood of the large stocks flowed out, dyed the skin, dyed Red bow tie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tuxedo clown can’t make a scream, the throat is full of sound, he wants to raise his hand and remove the deadly injury, but the shoulder joint and elbow joint seem to be Filled with glue, the action is simmering and slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who entered semi-meditation, was not scared by blood, and once again pulled the trigger, calming down like a daily exercise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tail of the tuxedo’s forehead, Horan, has a sinuous hole, red and red mooring, dimming the light of the eyes, the power of the delicate revolver is more than Klein’s I have to be a lot stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knees are bent, the arms are hanging down, the tuxedo clowns are slowly falling to the ground, and the eyes are solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His body twitched a few times and slowly stretched out, and there was no other movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shot hit, Klein has turned back very cool, shake the wheel, let the empty shells one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, wearing a black formal suit and a half-height silk hat, he walked to Al Hasson and took out the last silver hunter from his pocket. The bullet, stuffed it into the magazine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he does not look back at the tragic situation of the tuxedo clown is purely because of the discomfort of the first murder, but it does not kill, he does not know that the other party is completely controlled by the puppet. What will happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, he didn’t want to risk getting into the scope of the seal “2-049”. After all, no one can tell if this time there will be a strange change. The self-rescue of the "transportation ceremony" failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the items in the tuxedo clown, Klein only cares about the so-called "clown" potion formula, or the corresponding clues, but this does not require rushing The things that are done can be done with Dunn, Ayr, etc., and the team of the nights is almost equal to the ones they got. They can’t reluctantly refine the formula of the potion of the 8th, and it’s too big to spend time accumulating credit. It didn't take long before it became a "divination", and there was still a long way to go from "digestion." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking in the room, Klein walked quickly to Al Hasen. The gentleman in a gray trench coat was struggling to sit up and try again. Failure, falling into the mud and dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Hasen, what do I need to do?" He knelt down and asked, his left hand leaning against the ground to prevent accidental firing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay gasped and sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The monster is too strong, There are no weaknesses..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he pointed to a sky blue metal vial next to him, laughing at himself:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wanted to take the medicine, but I shook my hand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue metal vial that day probably has Klein The thickness of the thumb is no more than five centimeters in height, and the lid with the hidden spiral is dropped on one side and completely wetted by the liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein reached for the vial and blinked, but he replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Hasen, only a few drops on the wall of the bottle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go...Borgia, looking inside, inside, inside pocket." He talked continuously and gasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein stood up and asked, "Is this a therapeutic agent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious side items? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't delay, turned his body, and quickly walked to the painful Bolgi, and found the standard sky blue metal vial from the half-conscious night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unscrew the lid, he carefully put the bottle to the mouth of Borgia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borgia feels and tries to open her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottle is tilted and the dark red liquid flows into Borgia's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Estimated weight, Klein closed his hand and re-slid the cap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the pharmacy seems to be really good. After a few seconds of Bolgia swallowing, the look in the eyes re-agglomerates, and the voice is low and dumb: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he held his hands and slowly sat up and dealt with first After his own injury, he went to the coma of Loro Tower and Dunn, and found the "Goddess' Gaze" from the inside pocket of the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein returns to Ayr and feeds the remaining half of the bottle to the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ayr gasped a few times, and the action suddenly became agile, as if he had never stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to help Borgia, you are responsible for your companion." This very middle-aged man's charm refers to Leonard. Mitchell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had no opinion, turned his body and ran to the "Poet" Leonard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I can drink myself." Leonard, whose hair was sloppy, smiled and raised the sky blue metal vial in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at each other’s hands, he stood up agilely, and Klein, who wanted to have a belly, suddenly caught:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard’s injury is lighter than I expected...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has the ability to take the pharmacy from the very beginning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, he may have seen me a four-step "transfer ceremony" counterclockwise! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this is a good thing, my meditation is in my heart, and the "transportation ceremony" has no external abnormal performance, otherwise the tuxedo clown can't be fooled. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even then, Leonard, who has already recovered and chose to watch, must have seen a lot of things, for example, I did not receive "2-049" Influence, the calculation of the tuxedo clown...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein’s eyes were slightly picked up, Leonard, who came facing him, stopped beside him, eyes Look down at the front and laugh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I originally wanted to save you, but you don't need it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't care, there are many special people in the world who can always do things that others can't do, like you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "...just like me." Leonard's mouth was upturned, crossed Klein, and walked to the awakened Dunn and Lorotta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narcissistic madness... Klein secretly spit out a sentence, and he relaxed a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Leonard Mitchell also has a lot of secrets... He thoughtfully meets with the big forces and looks at the captain Deng When he put on his gloves, he picked up the Antignus family note that was covered in yellow and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cover of this note is made entirely of dark black cardboard, which exudes an ancient and long-lasting scent, with no signs of softening and decay, and Ryan’s dreams were almost identical, so that he began to suspect that he would see a fool wearing a smashed headdress when he opened it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he soon knew he wanted more, because Dunn carefully opened the notes and made the final confirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, no problem." Dunn closed the note and held it firmly, then looked at Aier and others. "Some days, I will store it and the seal '2-049' in the Chanis Gate of Tingen City. After that, wait until you recover, or Beckland will send someone again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this, Klein was a little disappointed, and he felt lucky, he was very I want to take another look at the notes of the Antignus family and figure out the cause of death of the original owner and Welch and Naya, but I feel that this ancient item is full of misfortunes and always brings disasters, so I dare not go. Touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned over to the church headquarters, sealed and printed, is the best choice... He secretly vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Al-Hassen and Borgia and Lolotta each nodded and turned and came to the seal "2- Next to 049". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They awaken each other and re-insert the puppets who have not resumed action into the cracked iron black box and closely monitor them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everything is fine." Ayre's tone is a bit more relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the iron black box of the micro-mans, the puppet with the smudged cloth strips over and turns the face with the clown paint The light source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this weird face, under the pure black innocent eyelids, there are two dark red cracks that are not easily visible. At the same time, Dunn, Leonard and the courageous Klein searched the body of the tuxedo clown and found out the paper flowers, handcuffs, and poker. And strange things like glass pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, apart from this, the other party did not bring anything of value, or something that could provide clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, there are seven or eight pounds and dozens of Sule's wallets except... Klein quietly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of money, he immediately bowed his head and examined himself, and his face almost collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is worth a few pounds of formal wear, because of the tumbling, rubbing out five or six places that need to be patched, and there are stains of dirt and dust everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng glanced at him with a squint of his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The loss in the mission All are reimbursable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reimbursement... I heard the word "invented" by Russell the Great, and Kline’s mood is beautiful:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this dress is well cleaned, make up, or wear it, it’s decent enough...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When the cost of reimbursement is down, you can buy another set and form a rotation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I am not the person who used the reimbursement for other purposes...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but later I have to consider the "battle suit", such as the captain's black windbreaker... If the material is a little bit worse, it is much cheaper than the tuxedo suit... Hey, Leonard is a guy who doesn't like to wear formalwear for a long time. Is there any consideration in this regard? ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The body asked Frye to see if he could identify his original appearance and find clues." Dunn touched the tuxedo clown with gloves. The oil on your face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, they searched the innermost warehouse and saw several groups of flesh-and-blood flesh-and-blood muds, and saw one after another. Broken bones are thrown everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Riel Bieber should be using the ancient rituals to absorb the power of the notes, just as we directly take the higher-order sequence of potions, This is full of danger, there must be an undisturbed environment, and it must be a certain period of time to sleep. This should be the reason why he has not left Tingen so far.” Dunn examined it again and guessed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this description, Ms. Lorota smiled palely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
