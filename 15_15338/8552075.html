			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early September, the weather has cooled from cool to cool, but the sunshine at three or four in the afternoon still makes people feel warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein passes through the walls of the spirituality and the window of the belly window, floating in the air outside the bedroom, overlooking the pedestrians and carriages coming and going on the daffodil street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a man wearing gray-blue workers’ clothes suddenly looked up and looked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was shocked and wanted to hide on the spot, but could not find a suitable cover for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a circle, there was no other way. He tried to drill home, but the corner of his eye swept over, but he saw the man’s gaze. It was only sweeping through the windows on the second floor, always following a sparrow to move, and finally regretted being smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of Timing, occasionally you can see birds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... I forgot, ordinary people can't see me at all... Klein breathed a sigh of relief and felt that he was not fully adapted to the current state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of the air, he lowered the height of the flight, approaching a fairly wide street, so floating on the top of the pedestrians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the distance was closer, Klein immediately found that his "gaze" was slightly equal to the vision, and there was no need to open it extra, but there was a limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, in addition to the gas field and emotional color, he also vaguely perceives the existence of each pedestrian's soul, ambiguous, illusory and transparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seem to be able to go straight through the flesh and attack the soul... Klein nodded thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hovered around and prepared to test the ultimate speed, so he tried to fly toward Iron Cross Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, he stopped and returned to the apartment where he originally lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be the speed of ordinary cars in the last generation, the kind of running high speed normally... Unfortunately, you can’t enter and exit the spirit world freely, otherwise it will be perfect... However, If you get lost in the spiritual world, the consequences are said to be very serious... Kline just finished his self-assessment, and he feels that his mood has become low, gray, and has no repressive repression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and saw that it was covered with dark colors that the normal people could not see, the sun was hard to disperse, and the residual numbness, despair, pain and other emotional layers were layered together. Just like the essence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After I was promoted to the 'Divination' last time, I learned from the inspiration, the iron cross street and the street have never changed... I don’t know how much Only in this year can I accumulate such oppression and darkness..." Klein remembered before sighing and pulling up to the top of the three-story building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, he finally felt the sun and got rid of the low mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein flies down the street, and from time to time can see the broken, numb, malnourished residents, and even two normal deaths. Both belong to the type of chronic hunger, poor health, and sudden illness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This month, I don’t know how many people will die in pain. However, the bankrupt peasants and the former slaves from the South China will soon fill them. The location... Klein breathed a sigh of relief, changed direction, and flew to the South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an industrial zone in Tingen, a steel factory, a lead-white factory, a ceramic factory, a printing factory, a metal production factory, a machinery manufacturing factory, etc. I am staring at you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying in the air, Klein saw the towering iron stove, and saw the dust, and saw that it was only a little better than the street. Thick and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a feeling of exhaustion, pain, pessimism, numbness, etc. The workers in their thirties belong to the minority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Klein wanted to lower the height and carefully observe the area, he suddenly felt weak and weak from the inside out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was "summoned" out, and when I ended the "call", I naturally returned! He calmed down his mind, carefully sensed his own state and the surrounding environment, and unexpectedly discovered that there was a subtle connection with himself in some place like infinity and infinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this connection, Klein wrapped the "Yangyan Charm" tightly and gave him a strong idea of ​​ending the "call". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge and horrible suction came, and his transparent to almost invisible figure jumped and disappeared into the material world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless gray and misty silence, the illusory still dark red star Without flicker, Klein reappeared in the palace of the giant's residence, appearing on the old and mottled bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process is like this...and... Klein is now looking at his own body with surprise, only to see a warm and pure thin inside. Thin gold pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yangyan Charm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really use my own way to "call" myself The matter is brought into the fog! It is difficult for him to take out the spell with a smile and repeatedly play it to confirm that this is not a virtual product. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stood up and smugly took a few steps, thinking with anticipation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Sure enough, materials and objects can also enter this mysterious space!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you can find the right way!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, this method is more complicated, requires a turnaround to achieve the goal, and is always 'summoned' by the member, which will damage the image of the 'fool', only I can use it, or After learning more, design a mantra that summons 'fools' but also points to me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I am a natural coolie, curse Why do you have to point to me? At that time, you can get a messenger-like but more special '眷' to receive and give the material..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Klein has a lot of ideas, but one after another, but limited to strength and knowledge level, can not be realized for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weakness became more serious, and Klein did not dare to stay again, wrapped himself with spirituality, simulating the feeling of falling into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, he returned to the bedroom and saw the bright sunshine coming in from the gap in the curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He examined himself and confirmed that the "Yangyan Charm" was not brought out and stayed on the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait for me to take a break, repeat the previous summoning ceremony in the early morning, and take the 'Yangyan Charms' back to the real world... oh, if that It’s good to keep the state for a long time, so I can check the houses with red chimneys more quickly. Unfortunately, I can’t do it now. Just flew for a while and check a few. I’m afraid I have to go back to the fog and rest for a long time. The efficiency is also low." Klein went to the desk and extinguished the quiet burning candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packing up the items, he did not immediately dispel the spiritual wall, but sat down, turned the pen and paper, began to write a letter, to Mr. Azick’s letter ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After writing the "Mr. Dear", think about it for a few minutes, Klein wrote:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"...I recently received an intelligence that one of the seven pirate generals, 'Hurricane Lieutenant', has been sneaked into Beckland, who is carrying a magical item called 'squirming hunger'. Can provide the ability to resemble a 'shepherd', while the 'Shepherd' is a sequence of 5 devours that make different souls, and correspondingly acquire a genius. It is said that they have a limited number of souls that are grazing at the same time, but can be replaced..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Qilingus has many extraordinary abilities, I don't know what he wants to do in Bakerland... Intelligence shows that this may involve a piece Very important and very magical items, enough to make Qierlings a high-ranking strong, or comparable to the high-ranking strong..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
