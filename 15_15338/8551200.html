I saw a gray-blue two-story house in my dream. All the windows on the first floor were closed, and the curtain was pulled. It was dark and brown in a few meters. There was no grass. There isn't a flower, it has a dilapidated garden, like the one that is common in ghost stories."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only place to identify it The symbol is a river not far from it, a relatively wide river."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This may be the Tasok River, or the Hoy River. I can only find it by means of investigation, and hope that it will still be available."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasok River is the largest river in the Kingdom of Lun, originating from the northwest direction of Mingermin The Ska Mountains go all the way to the southeast, passing through the counties of Fahrenheit and Ahowa, through the capital, Beckland, and into the sea near Port Pritz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It meets the city of Tingen with the southwest corner of the Western District and the Docklands south of the Southern District. The Hoy River originates from the York Hill in the north. The University District on the outskirts of the Eastern District joins the Tasok River locally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the two main rivers around Tingen, others can only be called creeks, not with wide water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Klein’s statement, Frye, whose skin was pale and chilly, nodded slightly and agreed with the other side’s thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of additional clues, troubleshooting is the only effective means! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Leonard smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe we can narrow the target The scope is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to reduce?" Klein asked with a silver pocket watch with a vine pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard laughed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For such a planned and purposeful perpetrator In the end, the target of the first selection will definitely be far from the area where the altar is located, which stems from the instinct to pursue safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait to other areas of the 'dead 'There are few left, and the difficulty of finding it will increase, he will consider the neighborhood.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, we should read the information again and filter out the number of deaths. At the very beginning, it was at a normal level, and in those days it was a fast-rising area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein heard his eyes bright:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great reasoning!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he lamented in his heart: "I really didn't have the talent to be a detective." !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frye nodded, picked up the information placed on the coffee table, and began to flip through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few minutes, he whispered and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is such an area And there is only one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which area?" Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frye handed the thick information to Leonard next to him, his lips scorned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Western District."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the West End? Klein clenched his fist and immediately suggested:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we will go to the southwest corner of the West End, the area is not big!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree." Leonard raised the information in his hand and echoed it very easily, as if the person who gave the narrower opinion just now was not his. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light two-wheeled carriage slowly travels on a slightly muddy and dirty road, and a wide river is not far from the sunset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and Frye looked out from the windows on both sides and examined the one house after another, with a focus on gray-blue, the garden was broken. If you can see it if you have the conditions, then pay attention to whether the curtains on the first floor are all pulled together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard sat leisurely in his back, leaning against the wall, sipping a little tune with a local touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dim scenery swept back and forth, and Klein’s corner of his eyes suddenly swept into a gray-blue two-story building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the small building, there is a garden that gives a sense of ruin and gloom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found it!" Klein pressed his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice did not fall, Frye and Leonard squeezed over at the same time, looking into the distance, as if there was no gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the carriage is getting closer to the house, the first floor of the dark curtain is drawn in the eyes of the three nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to do divination to confirm, Klein is absolutely certain that this is the house that I saw in my dreams. This is where the evil altar is. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter who he is, or Leonard and Frye, they did not immediately stop the carriage, let the driver continue to drive, crossed the goal, and stayed away from the goal. Just like passing by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he couldn’t see the building again, Leonard shouted at the coachman and stopped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein, you take this carriage back to Zouteland Street and replace the captain to help." Leonard snapped his fingers and looked at him with a smile Teammates said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I think is a dangerous thing for my chickens. This guy is still good... Klein snorted and immediately understood the meaning of Leonard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frye nodded next to it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just practice fighting, but also auxiliary "Occupation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, and the guy who can make so many deaths to hold the ceremony is definitely not a good deal, only the captain can make things less Terrible..." Klein took a breath and sensibly agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he looked at Leonard and looked at Frye again, squeezing a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, I cherish my life very much. Before the captain arrives, we will only monitor and will not approach." Leonard chuckled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frye didn’t say anything, just mentioned the suitcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein silently took a few seconds to pull out a copper penny road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am You do a divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He meditated "There will be a good result here," and the coin popped up as the eyelids deepened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coin flips up, rolls down, and steadily sticks to Kline’s palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stared at him and saw that the king’s head was facing up, and he suddenly breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is just a symbol of ambiguity, there are other interpretations, the most important thing is always to be careful and cautious." He used the divination method for Frye and Leonard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard has already turned around and heard the words and jumped outside the carriage:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Frye nodded seriously and took the suitcase and went down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing two teammates heading for the target house, Klein touched the left wheel in the gun bag and said to the coachman:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zotelan Street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver who was hired in time did not have the opinion to let the horses move again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 36 Zouteland Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein entered the Blackthorn Security Company, Mrs. Rosanne, Mrs. Oliana and others had already got off work, and it became very deserted and dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun, wearing a black trench coat, sat on the sofa in the reception area, did not light the gas lamp, and seemed to fit into the matte area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Find a clue?" He snorted and screamed, scaring Klein, who was looking at where the captain was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quickly turned and looked at Dunn’s ashes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, We..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly told Leonard’s “Bold Guess”, his own divination confirmation and subsequent field investigations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Leonard’s confidence, as far as the particulars he describes, nature is not important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dengen interjected from time to time to ask a sentence, and when he was finished, he stood up and walked to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Almost forgot, you stay here to guard against accidents." When he went downstairs, he turned back and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Kline Zheng focused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, in addition to Cohenri, who is on duty at Chanis Gate, other nights are busy outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down Smith squatted down a few stairs and suddenly stopped, and said that Klein, wearing a hat and facing the door, said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You locked the door and followed me. Oh, this is not to let you participate in the battle. One is to feel the atmosphere, and the other is to assist in the ritual magic when searching and checking. Remember, before the end of the event, you must stay away from us for at least 50 meters, and definitely not close to the house!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stunned, hard Nod: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun completely falls below the horizon, and the rushing Tsock River is deep and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark clouds covered the blushing month, letting the second-floor gray-blue house be like a monster hidden in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garden in front of the small building was quiet to the extreme, and there was no sound coming out. It seemed that there was no reptile and no life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at such a scene, sweating in his palms, and his body trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that there are countless horrible things in hiding, waiting, waiting for a bloody feast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his attention, Dunn, Leonard and Frye, who were almost integrated into the dark, carefully approached the target building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gray-blue house on the second floor, no lighted bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sleek, gentle and sweet young girl is sitting in front of the dressing table, studying the "complex" skin care with dim starlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
