			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After some busy, Klein opened the anti-locked bedroom door and looked into the living room, only to see Daniz lying in the easy chair. Sleeping and screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he heard the voice long ago, Klein couldn’t help but swear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's more than 3:00 pm!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you not completely listening to the radio ticker, this guy completely released himself? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After thinking about it, he gradually smiled and felt that it was in line with his own needs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ——The premise that he stays awake in a dream is that someone invades consciousness. When he is normally dreaming, he is still embarrassed. That is to say, he alone cannot experiment. After all, he will not “psychologically suggest”.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, his intention is to use other abilities to enter other people’s dreams, so that they can stay awake, just like a nightmare.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally planned to go out and find the right one, but now Daniz poses so well that people can't help but want to kick.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it’s a try... Klein corrected the thoughts in his mind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He considered it It doesn't use the "dream charm", because the ancient name of the sequence 7 "arsonist" is "Fire Master", and Daniz's inspiration is not low. Once it can shake the opening of natural forces. If the mantra is low, he will wake up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, whether he can effectively avoid it in time is another problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After consideration, Klein took out another prepared item, which was a gloomy gem-like gelatinous substance, which was left by the "nightmare". Extraordinary characteristics.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be used initially, just like the "All-Black Eye" of "The Secret Master" Rosago, but the effect is far better than After making magical items, for example, the extraordinary characteristics of this "nightmare", there is no way for Klein to stay in the hotel suite to walk through different dreams throughout the city. There is no way for him to forcibly drag people into dreams, but most The basic close-up intrusion into other people's dreams is still very simple.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein holds the dark "gems" and spreads out his spirituality. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of his eyes, the illusory deep black quickly filled, filling all the horizons, originally existed in Everything in it was shrouded in it, including Daniz on the easy chair.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no more human form, only a group of elliptical lights ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was about to extend spirituality and touched it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any signs, various scenes around him rushed out, flickering, and finally settled on a tens of meters long ship, which also had a thin spray The misty chimneys and the huge canvas hanging open, the deck was polished very brightly, reflecting the color of gold coins in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi is standing under the main cannon, holding his chest with both hands, leisurely urging the group of sailors, shouting from time to time:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take it there again!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dog, do you want to copy the ancient Fossack dictionary? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is very powerful on the "Golden Dream"... Klein didn't manage the owner of the dream, flew to the other side of the boat and found a The hidden place, falling to the deck, preparing for the test inspiration.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing he intends to try is very simple, that is, in the state of waking, mourning the "fool" in the dream Whether the name of the name is valid, whether he can detect that someone is praying!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, if the "just" lady is in danger in the collective subconscious sea, she can Seeking help in this way... Activities of the lower back muscles, Klein's expression gradually became serious, and he said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Followers who are not in this era; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mysterious ruler above the fog;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king of yellow and black who is in good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one The words of the Mies language spit out, and the name of the "fool" was soon and complete, but Klein did not hear the pray of the illusory cascading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No? Klein frowned and thought that it was really impossible, or where there was a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well...the mourning in the dream doesn’t really make a sound. It’s really not possible to rely on Hermes.... To rely on meditation to achieve the effect of prayer, It’s the same as the ancient Hemys language that can incite the power of nature. This is the same as the state of copying my unregistered account password...” Klein gently turned his head and cautiously mourned in ancient Hermes. Your own name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not afraid of this accident, but worried that the incited natural force awakened the "flame" Daniz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sentence describing the exit, and soon completed the three-stage structure, Klein's ear rushed back and layered layers of irritating illusory pray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Daniz’s dreams were shaken, and the “Golden Dream” was flying fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not stop, immediately left here, grabbed before Deniz awakened and returned to the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seven or eight seconds, Daniz sat up, feeling quite awkward and self-conscious:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"How do I dream of the madman of the singer of the "Golden Dream" on the 'Golden Dream'...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really terrible thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shit! It must be too worried about this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedroom Inside, Klein has stepped back four steps and entered the fog. Unexpectedly, he saw the "fool" high back chair with a circle of light, and it was himself in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is really effect. In the dream, you can get the answer by mourning the name of "fool" in ancient Hermes and giant language. It is no wonder that some people clearly do not do anything, but suddenly die in sleep. This is what information is usually read, what symbols are remembered, and accidentally reproduced in a dream? The dangers of this world are really hard to prevent... Klein closed the aperture and considered whether to tell the "Justice" Miss in another way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to say on the spot, after the notice, there is some damage to the image of "The Fool"... But Miss "Justice" is the kind of girl who is more curious, though It has been warned by Mr. "Down Man" and "Star". It has matured a lot, but there is still the possibility of taking risks... Of course, what is really going wrong, it is her own responsibility, and I don't care... Klein couldn't help but recall the "Justice" adoration of "The Fool", recalling her optimism and cheerfulness, and the revitalization of the entire organization in the Tarot Conference. contribution. Finally, he sighed and laughed at himself: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is a little.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the treatment of VIP customers..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making a decision Klein no longer hesitates, spreads spirituality, and touches the deep red "star" that represents Miss "Justice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; East Chester County, a large manor house.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey side and legs Sitting in front of the dressing table, I recalled the words of Mr. and Mrs. Suddenly I understood that the middle and upper levels of the “Psychological Alchemy Association” may not know that they can explore dreams through the “self-psychological suggestion” method, and explore the subconscious iceberg and the collective subconscious sea.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t sue I may be because this is too dangerous for the "psychologist", many people are already dead in the exploration... However, it should be warned normally... Ah, in their opinion, I am still only in sequence 8. The "reader" does not have the ability to "psychologically suggest", so there is no need to remind... Audrey finally thought of a question.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
