			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infected in the nameless island, the dead Green, appeared on the nameless island? Great Emperor, when did you change your horror novels? And, what's behind? Klein's eyes solidified on the last line of the third page diary and found no more content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, he has a strange collection of extraordinary creatures described by Russell, and I don’t know who is worshipping, there is also a feeling of horror, knowing Not all extraordinary creatures have wisdom and communication, and a large number of monsters are out of control, only crazy instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these out-of-control monsters are gathered together to worship the unknown! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the emperor did not leave the coordinates of the unnamed island...but even if he left, I don’t dare to go now, in case of infection If you die in the outside world, you will be born again on the island, and you will be in trouble... At least you have to have a sequence of 4 or even a sequence of 3, and you have the confidence to explore... Klein thinks, while letting his diary disappear, side Head to the "hidden" Jia De Li Ya, said with a smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your request?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Hidden" Jia Delia did not consider, directly asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Mr. Fool, I want to know if Russell the Great I have joined a very secretive and very old organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very secret is very old... "Twilight hermit"? Russell was once a member of them? "Justice" Audrey Huo Ran remembered the organization that had heard the "fool" before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""" """ """ And a mysterious organization, at that time, Mr. "fool" told members that the name of the organization should not be said outside, because "everything is said, it must be known"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such an organization really fits the level of Russell the Great... Alger nodded in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Fool" Klein thought of another thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mysterious Queen" The selection experience for the diary is vague. She cannot accurately ask questions about the content provided. That is to say, she can only know that the journal of a node is important, hides key information, or can judge from the handwriting. Russell's emotions when writing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the issue of Ms. "Hidden", there is no difficulty for Klein, he smiled slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he silently reminded himself in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of defending the "mysterious queen" in the future has nothing to do with the content of the submitted diary... Fortunately, I have seen a lot of Russell's diary before, and I have a full understanding of the Great...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he did not add, he smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- He does not directly say "Twilight Hermit", is thinking about answering this matter again next time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "hidden" Jia De Li Ya followed a ceremony, expressed gratitude, and then looked to the "magician": <br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to know the clues of the immediate descendants of the Abraham family, £1,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She offered no psychological burden because of the mystery The Queen will definitely give corresponding compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are you looking at me directly? She already knows that my teacher is a member of the Abraham family? "Magic" Firth was shocked first, and immediately felt that it was not an accident, because this matter is not a secret to Tarot members other than Ms. "Hidden", they are doing it with Ms. When it comes to trading, it is normal to mention it by chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After considering it, "Magic" Firth said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking for?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If you can provide reasons, I can convey them. As for whether there will be follow-up development, depending on their wishes, I am not sure. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, she is a seemingly ordinary, actually hiding many secrets, doing very cautious and careful ladies... "The Hidden" Jia Delia With a sigh of relief, I gently sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is very reasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am looking for the immediate descendants of the Abraham family. I hope to get the information of Mr. Gate. You will pass this on to them to see if there is a chance to cooperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, just to convey, I will also pay you £350 in cash, if they are willing to contact, there will be 650 pounds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folth endured for a full second and replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The deal. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, she only tasted the meaning hidden in the words of "The Hidden":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Men" is related to the Abraham family? Also, my bracelet comes from Mrs. Anlisa, belonging to the Abraham family... The teacher still does not know that I already know that he is a member of the Abraham family... can only be free in the letter To put it bluntly, when I was meeting in a circle, I heard someone looking for a direct descendant of the Abraham family, what happened to Mr. "Gate"... I don't know what kind of reaction the teacher would have...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the next lady of "Justice" is sincerely happy for her friends, feeling that the other party has finally got rid of the bankruptcy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Fulth has already sequenced 7, and is about to catch up with me. I have to fight to become a "hypnotist" soon... She thinks like this, while looking at the members of the Tarot Society, she hopes to have psychedelic Clue of the bell tree fruit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Miss Yi’s gaze is really hard to refuse... “Magician” Foers is slightly embarrassed to lower his head, because in her circles, there are no clues to the psychedelic bell tree fruit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite "downside down" Alger has been indulging for two seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have clues, But it will take at least two weeks to get it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does have clues. A long time ago, when he and Qieringers went deep into the original island, they found a psychedelic bell tree. Not enough strength, did not try to approach, and now, he has the hope of promotion sequence 5, naturally do not want to let go of the opportunity to make money, after all, he still owes the "star above the sea monster" message fee.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why it is mentioned now is because it belongs to the declaration of sovereignty in a certain sense - by then, he will explore with the "world", and what they want to get best is to make it clear in advance. In order to avoid conflicts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, when dealing with the psychedelic bell tree, the "world" German Sparrow will stand aside Look, don't provide any help.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem! "Audrey was delighted and didn't even ask the price.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has already started to consider Beckland in June, find a reason to find an excuse, directly to The psychological alchemy will be purchased.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the end of the two transactions, because the members have no other needs for the time being, the "hidden" Jia Delia repeats Once again, the blood of the mythological creatures was collected. After the "Moon" Emlin once again proposed to search for the remaining four believers of the "primitive moon," Tarot would enter the free communication session.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik automatically and consciously said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have become a 'notary'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This doesn't need to tell us... "The hanging man" has an urge to cover his face, but he still responds calmly and calmly:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
