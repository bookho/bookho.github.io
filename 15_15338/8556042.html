			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the giving ceremony, Klein handed over 2,500 pounds of cash and the golden quaint mask provided by the "downside down" to Miss "Justice" and used the "world" "Pray for the image, and the other party will complete the transaction as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two weeks, I used almost 5,000 pounds. If I don’t leave Tingen, the money is enough to support the elderly, and my usual life can be maintained. The standard of the landlord's wife... The dolls ruined their lives, drinking medicine for three generations... Klein looked at the innocent fog and the ancient palace that had restored silence, quite a bit stunned, like something lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmed down for a few seconds, returned to the real world, picked up the remaining 830 pounds on the desk, and deliberately counted six five-pound denominations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Klein put the 30 pounds of cash into the wallet that was completely smashed and put it firmly into the pocket inside the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other 800 pounds, he split into two stacks, put a stack of left and right pockets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Klein pulled the drawer and took two of the five deep sea naga hairs brought back to the real world in advance, using paper one after another. Wrapped in layers, carefully put into the dark pocket of clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, he took a hat and a cane, went to the street in the light of the gas light at night, took the carriage and went straight to the Bakerland Bridge area. The "Brave" bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a lively and noisy environment, Klein insisted on drinking the cup of Nanwell beer, and then slowly drifting through a wave of waves. The boxer cheered, left the bar and got on a rental carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the rolling of the wheel, he deliberately closed his eyes, and suddenly the sound of the window was tapped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's face muscles fretting, blinking at the front, seeing pale, delicately dressed Miss Sharon has sat quietly opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without waiting for the other party to ask, Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I took you last time The message provided sold for a good price, the Amon family tomb."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon did not speak, quietly looking at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a cane and took two stacks of cash and a small piece of paper from his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"800 pounds plus two deep sea Naga's hair, the total value is around 1000 pounds, this is what you deserve." Klein took a breath. With a smile, the cash and paper group was handed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon glanced at him and reached for both of these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lowered her head and looked at the items in her hand, whispering and whispering: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How much did you sell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2000 pounds, half a person." Klein chuckled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the "heart of the machine" is only given 1,500 pounds according to the original plan, then I can only owe a part of it... he is quite fortunate to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon did not have a bloody palm, and the cash and paper balls did not know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up, "Well," and succinctly asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I don’t know, I didn’t go.” Klein did not disclose the help of Mirror Arrods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, he felt that if he described the experience in detail, Miss Sharon would definitely be one-handed and focused on listening as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "resentment" lady seems to have a hobby to watch the scene drama and listen to various rumors... Klein summed it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon's expression has not changed, silent for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone is digging in the channel Underground ruins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Klein couldn't respond to what the other party was talking about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon he understood what the underground relics in Sharon’s words meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only one underground relics that both of them know, that is, the remains of the Quaternary Tudor dynasty, where there is a horrible evil spirit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone is digging the tunnel and wanting to enter the underground building? Klein sinks for a few seconds and suddenly has inspiration: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the baron?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has forgotten the name of the hidden figure of the descendants of the dynasty, only remember that he still has a title from the baron, living in West Vilas Street where the Beckland Police Department is located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Sharon gave a positive reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does he want to look for? Doesn't he know that there is a evil spirit inside? He doesn't know that the extraordinary people before their family have died inside?" Ryan raised a few questions from his own words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon sat quietly and answered seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if he knows "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...How long does it take him to dig?" Klein asked at his discretion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two to three months, he has only one person for a while." Sharon gave his own judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, Klein spoke a little bit: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This does not require anxious Waiting for me to prepare, let's go to 'visit' him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he smiled and explained:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, I like to be well prepared in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before promoting "No Face", I No more blending! He warned himself in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Sharon did not ask him what to prepare, and his figure quickly faded and disappeared into the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned back against the wall and felt relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The material of the "No Face Man" potion has been booked, just wait for "delivery"... The foreign debts are all paid off, no need to worry about anything... he The mood is like a precipitated sparkling wine, and occasionally a little joyful and silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only bad thing is... Klein touched his left chest, where there was a dry wallet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed and said to himself without making a sound:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 30 pounds of cash plus 5 gold coins and some change..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thursday afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey Hall is waiting for the arrival of Teacher Islant in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- After receiving the reply of "downside down" and "world", she immediately sent a servant to send a letter to Islant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the letter is very ordinary, that is, I hope that the second psychological class this week will advance to Thursday, but in fact, Audrey has long been with Islan The special agreement is good. Once she expresses a similar meaning, it means that the other party to the transaction has agreed to the conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tick and ticking, the wall clock on the wall walked briskly, and Isilante, with long hair and waist, took a few textbooks and entered the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey immediately gave Su Shi a look, the Golden Retriever dog sneaked out a little, and went to the shadows nearby to observe people coming. to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Island closed the door of the study, slowly looked around, then sat down on the opposite side of the white round table and put down the teaching materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are they paying money or magical items?” asked the member of the psychological alchemy club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One gave a direct 2,500 pounds, one provided a magical item." Audrey whispered a white from his orange medium-sized tote. The cardboard box is covered with a spiritual wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlocking the spiritual wall, she opened the lid and let the golden quaint mask appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she repeated the mask's flaws and effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, when she got this magical item, she was very curious and wanted to try the effect. After all, this is the form she officially contacted. A magical item, but in the end, she still restrained herself, she didn't want to be cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The value is basically the same." Islant tried it and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop for two seconds, she pulled out the thickest textbook and turned to page 48. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle part of this textbook has been hollowed out, with a palm-sized iron box and a rolled up parchment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Human skin shadow features... ‘Winners’ potion formula...” Islant introduced while presenting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey's gaze casts on the characteristics of diamonds, and the faces formed by the light and shadow inside make a dizzy look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, this has some ability to restrain the "audience"... Is this the sequence of the "world"? No wonder... Audrey moved his eyes and looked at the potion formula:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 6, 'Wind', main material: six of the blue shadows Crystallized feathers, a pair of eyeballs of longan sea eagle..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey also has time to review the auxiliary materials, and Isilant has rolled up the parchment in time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, she re-made the spiritual wall of the iron box, closed the teaching materials, and pushed this heavy book to Audrey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey held the book, but did not hand over the gold-colored quaint mask and 2,500 pounds of cash to Islant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the other person’s doubts, she smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worry about the characteristics are not consistent, afraid that the formula is fake, I hope to be able to verify first.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before the verification is completed, the money and things are kept by me, placed on me Here, they all think that I am very reputable, and I don't want to lose this reputation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand their concerns. "Island has gotten off the road. "We also believe in you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, money and things are in the hands of their own members, and she is not worried about being cheated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;And Miss Audrey has money and status, she is a guarantee, trustworthy...Island is thinking about it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the fog, in the ancient palace.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein holds the pendulum, divination The authenticity of the "Wind" potion formula.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not want to neglect to lose the most experienced and powerful members of Tarot, "pour Hanger" Mr..<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blinking to see the citrine pendant turning clockwise, Klein breathed a sigh of relief and passed the idea to the symbol "upside down man" The crimson star.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of Generosity.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger first saw the boundless gray mist, swirling I heard a "fool" Mr. muffled but lofty words: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; " 'Justice' Miss completed the transaction. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
