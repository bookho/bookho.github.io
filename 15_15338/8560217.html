			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein regained his gaze and looked at the dense forest to the rear with almost no light to shine into, and generally understood where it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "declining forest" that Grosser guarded during the "Giant King Ting". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees in the forest are all tens of meters high, so thick that they need multiple giants to be surrounded, but the skin is mottled, there are many decays, branches and leaves All dried up, hang down, entangled with each other, like the dim clouds floating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grossel and several giants similar to him are guarding the outer edge of the forest, or picking an axe, or holding a big sword, dedicated to guarding different directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" According to Grosser, this 'declining forest' is buried with the father and mother of the giant King Olmer, except that the ancient god can enter No one can set foot, including the guards of them... Well, the parents of the giant King Olmer should be the so-called first-generation giants, the craziest and the most fierce and cruelest, probably...hey, why Grosell will do Such a dream?" Klein thought, suddenly noticed that something was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the situation he had just chatted around in the city of Pesot, this Grosell is now a local grown-up giant, with the "giant" Wang Ting has nothing to do with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this dream is quite abnormal now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the theory of psychological alchemy that Ms. Dai Li and Miss Justice have mentioned, perhaps the world in the book will use or copy the original The subconscious and collective subconscious of the character, and then slightly modified, let the consciousness meet the needs of the current setting, so now Grosser will be influenced by his own subconscious in his dream, and reproduce the original in the 'Giant Wang Ting' Life... If this is the case, I can only say that this book is a cruel writer..." Klein thought of it, suddenly moving his heart and thinking that this was an opportunity to harvest the information about "Giant Wang Ting". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had intended to ask Grosell directly about this aspect of the problem. Who knows that the Giant Guardian died in the North with the promise of fulfilling his promise? In the battle of Wang Yurisian, the spirits quickly dissipated after leaving the world of books, and did not give a chance to communicate. Now he finally has another way, which is to explore the dream of Grosser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be some of them that are ridiculous and exaggerated, but the rest of the content must be a realistic mapping. As long as you study it carefully, there is no way to tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grossel has never entered the 'declining forest', even if there are scenes, it is from his imagination, there is no need to explore..." Ryan slowly turned his eyes to the mountain where Wang Ting was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not high, indicating that the "declining forest" is located on the hill quite close to Wang Ting, from which there should be a direct road to the ancient god's residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t waste time looking for it, went straight to Grosser, put on a look we were very familiar with, and asked without hesitation: < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do I get back to Wang Ting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that Grosser is an honest giant Dreams must be more honest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grosser raised his hand and scratched his head, laughing a little in confusion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you go back from the 'ridiculous tunnel'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the front side and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"You can see it by bypassing the boulder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Klein lamented the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his back as far as he goes, Grosser has scratched his head and confused himself: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is he? Why do I feel familiar..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a piece of boulder protruding from the mountain wall, Klein is in front of Horan Cheerful, there was a huge cave at least thirty meters high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had just approached, and the mouth on the stone was opened:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why return to Wang Ting in advance?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Called by the King." Klein said that he did not change his color and said that the intelligence of all the creatures in this dream is basically equal to the master of the dream, that is, Grosser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lips on the stone are inconsistent, and the sound of Qianlong is heard:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please answer I have a problem, otherwise I can't pass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... At this time, if you bring "Magic Mirror" Arrods, there should be something very fun. Occurred... Klein’s belly, calmly nodded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lips are closed after three seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If your wife, your daughter, and your awkward woman, let you judge who is the most Beautiful, how would you choose?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is completely different from the problematic style of “Magic Mirror”... Kline’s mouth is moving, his thoughts are turning, and he is using Ten seconds before I replied: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My wisdom is not enough to judge this, I will assign a more intelligent person to give the answer." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Species may send propositions how to answer yourself? He added in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Who is a more intelligent person?" The giant face on the stone tablet was stagnant for a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein Zhuang replied seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is our king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone monument is dumb, and it takes a while to speak:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, even if you answered You can pass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately crossed the strange stone and entered the cave in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground of the cave is covered with large weathered slabs, with a mural on both sides and above, telling the giants and dragons, and the wolves, and The story of heterogeneous, fighting with the devil, and the immortal bird, the style of the painting is rough, the color is faint, but it is extremely expressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While looking at the murals, Klein walked forward and found a cluster of weeds, as well as many under the slate gap and murals. Rough gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the water that rushes here, the feeling of the decline of life is deeper and more intrinsic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Klein saw an open gray-blue door, standing on either side of the door with a giant of four or five meters tall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giants who are here are different from Grosser, wearing hard and gorgeous iron black armor and wearing a sturdy helmet like two Huge statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not block Klein, let him pass through the gate and enter the hall inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hall is not wide, the edges are clearly visible, and the whole can accommodate fifty or sixty giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is observing the environment, suddenly under the foot, and then the entire hall seems to be invisibly hand-drawn, flying up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood firm as he swayed, and saw the gray stone wall flashing past the door, continually plunging down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a ten-second effort, the clanging sound came out and the hall stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the door is no longer a cave tunnel, but a magnificent temple supported by a stone pillar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
