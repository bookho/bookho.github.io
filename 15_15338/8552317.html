			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver spell is chilling, like a crystal of layers of snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shuddered, his mind awake, fear and panic seemed to have been briefly frozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was busy pouring his own spirituality into the spell, and used his fingers to push the thin piece of silver out of his pocket and fall to his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark red flames appear in the air, and the slight and continuous explosions reverberate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of serenity and deepness spreads in an instant, enveloped a small half-bedroom, enveloped Mrs. Shelen and the "sleepless" Cohenri, also shrouded Klein Yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Sleep Charm" itself is an item that does not separate the enemy. When it is used normally, it needs to be thrown out and thrown at the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, I am at best only affected by the aftermath, not to resist the temptation to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Klein’s arm is entangled in countless invisible filaments, there is no way to throw a spell, only to exchange her own sleep for Mrs. Xuelun Sleeping! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a similar situation, he has long considered and prepared because it involves his own speciality, unlike most low- and medium-sequence extraordinarys. special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Klein’s eyelids hang down, entering the sleeplessly, and entering the dream, while Mrs. Shelen and the slugged Coenley also There has also been a delay and a pause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this abnormal mode, Klein quickly found himself in his dreams and sensibly knew he was asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it involves compulsory dream invasion and similar hypnosis effects, he can stay awake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case when Dunn’s nightmare ability is encountered, as is the case when Dai Li is psychic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein forcibly broke the dream and woke up, only to feel that the numerous filaments that tied his arms, legs and body were slightly loose, no longer tight, but the whole body Mrs. Xue Lun, who was next to the mirror, looked confused and seemed to be about to get rid of the effect of the "Sleep Charm" but did not really wake up. Cohenli fell to the ground, "Psychic's Mirror" was buckled nearby, revolver Bounced to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein seized the opportunity of the roots to relax, took out the left palm, slammed a finger and lit a light blue spiritual flame. And use it to burn countless filaments to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he raised the left wheel with his right hand and pulled the trigger continuously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two silver hunting devil bullets were shot and shot at Mrs. Shelen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t confirm the result, his knees were bent, his back was hard, and a roll was leaning against Cohenri, and he smashed the roots of his body. wire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of his shooting was mainly to inform the captain outside, telling Dunn Smith that there was an accident and entered the fighting state, please come to the rescue as soon as possible. Of course, if you can directly hit Mrs. Snow, it is the best result, the best development! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Klein doesn't think that one of the extraordinary people who might be sequence 7, or even sequence 6, is so easy to solve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a little, a light blue flame in the air, it’s all ignited, and in this fantastic scene Two silver hunting devil bullets accurately hit the body of Mrs. Shelen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click, click! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Shelen’s wearing a translucent nightgown, the looming body collapsed like a red moon in the lake, the full-length mirror next to her cracked, most changed It became a piece of the size of the thumbnail cover, and a small amount still hangs on the frame, all of which are like slaps, grotesque slaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;substitute? The extraordinary ability of the witch sequence? Klein swept over the corner of his eye and rolled to the side of Cohenli, because the filaments were broken by his movements, and the light blue flame in the air did not spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Mrs. Shelen disappeared, and Cohenli in "Sleep" extended her hands and grabbed her neck and spit. Outflow, tongue spit out, still not let go~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s vision, there is nothing strange in the neighborhood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of a paragraph in the seal "3-0227" data:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most The dangerous situation is to see yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn’t Cohenley just through the full-length mirror, seeing the seal '3—0271' reflects himself?” Klein’s thought flashed without thinking about time. I also found a silver spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a triangle, it is the "An Soul Charm." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blush!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein spit out the ancient Hermes words while perfusing spirituality. Throwed a spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he pressed his left hand and touched the "mirror's mirror." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just confirmed it with the corner of his eye, this seal is facing down and will not reflect on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The triangular silver spell burns the ice blue flame, and the soft and peaceful black covers Cohenri and affects Klein himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nervousness of the emotions dissipated, and Cohen’s own neck’s movements suddenly slowed down, and Klein’s no longer seemed to be on the battlefield, but rather at home. In front of the bulging window, overlooking the quiet streets of the night, the body and spirit are thus quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Klein hopes to change! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he entered an extremely peaceful state, the whole world seems to have only one person left, no other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this feeling, he has a flash of instinct in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Shelen will attack my right waist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the predictive ability of the "Clown" in the battle. Klein grabbed the "Psychic's Mirror" without hesitation and rolled over to the left. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just had an action, a dagger burning with a black flame slammed into the position he was in, and stabbed his right waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Shelen’s figure once again outlined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the roll, Klein suddenly lifted the "Psychic's Mirror" and shone to Mrs. Shelen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just moved closer to Cohenli, in addition to rescue companions, the main purpose is to pick up this seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, he doesn’t think he can support the captain in the hands of Mrs. Shelen’s, and get a good ending – “Yangyan Charms” can be used to deal with the extraordinary. But the effect is not as good as bullying the dead, and the other party will not stand stupid, let you use the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it doesn't work, Klein can only venture to use the "Aziz Copper Whistle". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explain things, wait until you save your life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the development of things is better than Klein expected, Mrs. Shelen chose to assassinate, did not interrupt him using the Soul Charm and hold the "Psychic Mirror" "Try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Klein immediately developed a simple plan to avoid the aftermath of the "safe soul" effect, thereby improving the predictive ability of the "clown", and then Seize the opportunity, avoid the attack, and use the "Psychic's Mirror" to reflect the enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Shelen, wearing a translucent nightgown, was slammed into the air and was about to catch up with the agile tumbling opponent. She suddenly saw a mirror with three cracks. mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mirror, the waves of water swayed, and a figure of a woman emerged. Her hair was black and thick, and she draped straight to cover her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shakes his left hand, "Psychic's Mirror" slides along the carpet for a few tens of centimeters, face up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pale hand extended out of the mirror, the figure of a woman wearing a white linen-like dress quickly climbed out of the mirror and rushed to Mrs. Shelen . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Snow's expression was slightly gloomy, and the brown, pure eyelids were stained with a layer of darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She surrounded her seven black flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, a black flame flew out and hit a woman in a white dress with long hair covering her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman burned up, and the painful groan in her mouth quickly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖,嗖,嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black flame is like a bullet, and the tail is directed at Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's pupils shrank, and quickly rolled over, dare not have the slightest pause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his tumbling motion gradually became stagnant, because a nearly invisible thin line entangled, slowing his speed, affecting His movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is simply the nemesis of the "clown" fighting ability! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black flame wiped Klein’s face and flew over to the big bed of Mrs. Shelen’s, but it did not burn, it seems only Affecting things that have life or spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is still lucky in the future to escape the previous blow, and suddenly a flash of hunch in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he slammed the spine and turned it into a roll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A transparent ice crystal rifle was highlighted, stabbed on the carpet and stabbed Klein’s original scheduled position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white frost spread and spread to Klein, who was affected by the filaments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly shuddered, his body became stiff, and although he was able to act, he was quite slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Mrs. Shelen’s side is coiled up with a new black flame, and a transparent frost pistol is condensed in her hand. Klein no longer hesitates and puts her hand into the pocket. Lived in the Azick copper whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;荷,荷,荷. At this time, Cohenli got rid of the influence of "Soul of Soul" and "Sleep", climbed up, and looked at Mrs. Xuelun empty-eyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face seems to be covered with a shadow, silent and strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, "Coenley" rushed to the nearest Mrs. Shelen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Snown’s eyes were slightly stunned, and the black flames that lingered around each other were shot one after another and shot on the body of Cohenli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗,噗,噗, that blossoming black flame disappeared like a snowflake, and did not cause any effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein first glimpsed, then raised his right hand and fired a shot at Mr. Xue Lun’s current location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Shelen’s dodge in advance, throwing a frosty pike, but it’s just stabbing “Kornli”, piercing the target’s clothing and not penetrating The skin did not make a freeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! Klein fired another shot, and Mrs. Shelen flashed to the broken full-length mirror and picked up a slap-sized piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She moves agilely to avoid the bullets, and uses the irregular fragments to illuminate another "Coen Li", letting the other person's figure Into the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
