			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat in front of the bar and slammed his fist down the table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A cup of Southwell Beer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After him, several guards hesitated to come over to warn, or pretend that no one had just fired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender gave the guards a look, picked up a glass, and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Why don't you have a 'sweet lemon'?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our boss once went to Trier to learn to have a bartender and mastered many of the cocktails left by Russell the Great. The category and created Olavy's most popular 'sweet lemon'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't move, calmly responded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only drink beer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All right. "The bartender is not in a hurry to pick up Southwell Beer, and smiles. "Sir, are you an adventurer?" "There was no answer," said Klein, who nodded and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you should go see our boss, he is always friendly to new adventurers, happy to invite them to drink, and this is for you." Other help. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who was planning to buy the "Master of Secrets" aids, did not refuse, took out the brass-colored pennies, and bounced, He steadily caught.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the 1 pence of copper coins on the bar, as a thank you for the bartender reminder, he slowly stood up and followed a Guarding up the stairs to the second floor, enter the room at the other end of the corridor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is covered with a thick brown carpet, filled with high quality coal burning Taste, mixed with the aroma of cigars.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A middle-aged man with a blond hair tidy and leaned back in an easy chair, smoking a cigar, looking at the newspaper, around There are more than six bodyguards.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Klein is not an extraordinary person in the field of "audience", it is impossible to judge the characteristics and strength of those bodyguards from the details, and it is not a glimpse. The secret person, the "monster" way, can see a certain secret, find something that others can't find, but his spirit Sexual instinct makes him believe that there are definitely extraordinary people in those bodyguards who can pose a certain threat to him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man put down the newspaper and pulled it The neckline of the black shirt, standing up slowly, sticking out the right hand: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to Olavi, my adventurer friend. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His blue eyes with a bit of smile, looks quite sincere.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Klein also stretched his right hand and touched the other side, did not speak, waiting for the other party to open.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man pointed to the sofa opposite the easy chair, Lightly laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the owner of this place, Bilt. Brando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I used to be an adventurer, and the strength is not bad, at least I can live to the present and make a lot of money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident in my strength, so I dare to express it directly... Klein sat down unceremoniously, leaning forward slightly, waiting for Bilt to continue to tell . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the opposite adventurer did not respond, Bilt sat down again, took a sip of cigars, and said leisurely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Frankly speaking, I met every new adventurer and did have my own purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the room desk The nautical chart on the top, the voice is magnetically described: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the Rothde Islands to the east, the sea is increasingly chaotic, the power of the military and the church It is getting smaller and smaller, and can only protect the port where it is located.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sea area is a paradise for pirates. It is very unfavorable to our adventurers. Therefore, I hope to organize everyone and build a loose alliance to unite in the face of danger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This alliance will not be too binding. You can choose to watch when other adventurers are in danger. No one will punish you, but after that, if you encounter a similar situation, Need to look forward to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, one thing I can promise is that this league's adventurer can get a discount close to the reserve price when buying goods here, at least when selling the harvest, at least It is equivalent to the market price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning, Bilt smiled at the new adventurer opposite, and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Is there any interest in joining this loose alliance, rest assured that it will not let you have extra expenses, our aim is to help each other only when encountering pirates."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, I think so, I used to name this ally 'Adventure Brotherhood', and later I think the word 'brother' is too compulsory, so I changed it to 'Adventurer Mutual Aid'." Bilt Self-deprecating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he lowered his hand with a cigar, licked his lower lip and shook his head and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Sorry, forgot to ask for your name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein keeps his posture unchanged, and his voice replies in a low voice:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German Sparo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German Spalo..." Bilt eyelid jump For a moment, the smile suddenly became a little stiff, and the bodyguards around him were very tight, as if they were enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilter quickly returned to normal, did not seek to be really German Sparrow, or a fake liar, hehe laughed: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to buy? I have a lot of good things here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sunia The spring of the golden spring." Klein's appearance was dull, and he said cautiously inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not mention the bark of the dragon tree, anyway, this material also has a good chance to buy in the herbal shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilter. Brando is sigh of relief and smiles: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Simple.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"100 ml 30 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trust me, even if you go to the island of Sunia, it is at most a few pounds cheaper than this price, and those of the Saskatchewan barbarians have blocked a spring. It's hard for others to get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete." Klein knows the price of Golden Spring, knowing that 30 pounds and 100 milliliters are really cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete the deal, Bilt was thinking about opening his mouth and suddenly heard the knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting his permission, a guard came in and put it in his ear and whispered a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilter’s expression is getting darker, and the whole person looks unusually cold and exudes an indescribable murderousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the strength is quite good, the former is not a famous adventurer, is a well-known pirate... There should be a sequence... Kline looks at each other, calmly doing Judge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilter turned his head and barely told Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Spallo, I have something to deal with.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a chance to drink together in the future. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Klein slowly got up and didn't have the idea of ​​interfering with each other's affairs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this does not mean that he is not curious, but that curiosity is not enough to make him change his style of action.
