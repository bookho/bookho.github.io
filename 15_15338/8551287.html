			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister, you are so too fond of worry, no, it’s too meticulous! Klein heard the spirit and immediately laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melissa, your worry is very reasonable, I really have some hungry, um, I am the first Go up and take a bath and take a shower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is already swallowing quietly, it is more important to confirm the whereabouts of "teacher" Terry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows if this guy will retaliate more and more in the future! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Melissa didn't look up and continued to learn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Klein quickly ran to the second floor and entered the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He locked the door of the house, took off his coat, removed the gun bag under his arm, and took out a plain silver knife from the drawer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sealing the housing room with a spiritual wall, he took a breath and calmed his mind, taking four steps counterclockwise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "Fusheng Immortal Heaven" and other mantras, Klein, who has become more and more accustomed to the crazy swearing spirit, once again appeared on the fog. Inside the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used a few ceremonies today and squeezed his temples with a slight exhaustion, and a yellow-brown parchment appeared on the bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean seriously thought about it and wrote a divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Terry The whereabouts of the silk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not sure that the name is correct, but has specific physical features and detailed information as a guide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the parchment, Klein leaned back on the back of the chair and thought about the things related to Terry in his mind, then meditation seven times. Divination statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He emptied his spirit, closed his eyes, and with the help of meditation, he quickly entered the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a foggy illusory scene, he saw the front of a steam train with smoke and sparks, saw side-by-side leather seats, and saw clean and tidy car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face is round and the eyes are long and narrow, and the sweet and gentle Terry is sitting in the window, with a top edge inlaid with a fine grid on the table in front. Black gauze hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein carefully identified and tried to confirm the number of trips, but could not see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, he unbearably withdrew from the dream, his eyes reflected the ancient mottled bronze long table and the illusory crimson stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can only be determined that Terry is leaving Steaming on the steam train. There are no more clues... Hey, it seems that this mysterious space is mainly for me. Excluding interference, the improvement of my own divination level is not exaggerated..." Klein tapped his finger on the edge of the table and thought about the next move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this divination, he fully confirmed that the goal was the former "teacher" Tries, but in the case that the other party has fled Tingen, he does not feel that The results can better help Dunn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The captain has already said that it is necessary to send electricity to Beckland, to the port of Enmat, to the main site along the railway, the national Tongli Talis... ... I will not report the results of this divination, so as not to be suspected..." Klein quickly made the decision, because with or without his reminder, Dunn was in the most correct way to arrange the follow-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the case that the dream divination can not see the number of trips, the method of switching to the spirit pendulum will not obtain effective results, even if the means of elimination are adopted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar situation also includes the red chimney. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he felt the lack of spirit, did not stay too much above the fog, wrapped himself with spirituality, and simulated the experience of falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he "returned" to the room, his mind was full of oily lamb chops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must sprinkle cumin... praise the goddess!" Klein swallowed, and the wind lifted the spiritual wall and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day at 8:40, he entered the Blackthorn Security Company with a cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Klein, good news!" Rosanne at the back of the reception desk excitedly waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s eyes are bright:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Catch Terry?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Terry? Who is she?" Roshan, wearing a pale green dress, looked blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...you don't need to know her, what good news?" Klein opened the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roshan smiled brilliantly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The captain’s application was approved and the police department will I have two police officers who have been in contact with extraordinary events to be a civilian! I don't have to stay up all night, praise the beautiful god!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really good news..." Ryan is sincerely attached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few words with Rosanne, he went to the ground through the partition and planned to continue the occult course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing through the captain’s office and the night entertainment room, he looked into the camera and found that Dunn, Leonard and others were there, which showed last night. The search and troubleshooting did not get good results, and then they can only be handed over to the police department, who will do the tedious follow-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Klein wanted to find a captain to talk about the latest situation, but saw that he was busy writing a manuscript, taking a telegram, and had to silently retreat, not to go. Excuse me, I will ask again at noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He entered the ground along the steps and saw two rows of elegant gas lamps surrounded by metal grids, saw the light shining through the glass and the silence Constant corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathing a cool, cold breeze, Klein took a few steps and suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He violently turned his gaze to the gas lamps, and his brows gradually wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found himself making a common sense mistake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is a common mistake in the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the divination above the fog last night, Klein saw that Terry was on a steam train, so she subconsciously determined that this was happening. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, however, no one in the world has ever invented electric lights and invented similar devices. There will be almost no manned steam trains running after dark, and this is Seeing the Green Leather train driving at night, Klein instinct is ignored! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, that was not the last night! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the picture of the future he foresees! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what will happen today or tomorrow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was in a tight heart, took a few steps back and forth, and ran back upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked on the door of the entertainment room and saw Leonard standing by the window and carrying a poem, his face was helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disregarding the playing cards of Cohenli, Loy Yao, and Siga Thong, Klein looked to Leonard Road:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have questions to ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to learn how to tease ladies and ladies happy?" Germany put down the "Rossell Poetry" and tweeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked out of the recreation room, followed Klein to the middle of the stairs leading to the ground, staring at each other's eyes, smirked and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you did a very effective divination last night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not explain, directly said: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My divination came out of the steam train."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After yesterday's communication in the Western District Almshouse, he did not mind showing a little "special" in front of Leonard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The steam train, the earliest class is seven o'clock..." Leonard pulled out the pocket watch in his shirt pocket and glanced openly. "Can't delay! I will tell the captain that I have received a reliable information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hurried upstairs and went straight out of the Blackthorn Security Company. After a few minutes downstairs, return to the office of Dunn Smith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein breathed a sigh of relief, and the night-watchers who watched the cards were summoned, followed by the captain who sent the telegram to rush out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling what happened just now, his feelings are quite complicated, and the death of the clown in the tuxedo gives him a different alert. This time the same kind of mistake happened to him. In his own body, this makes him seem to understand a lot and the lessons are more profound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned to the arsenal and entered the guard house. He took off his hat, took off his coat, and hung them on the coat rack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil just tossed the coffee by hand, and took a sip of it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Is there a cup?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein sat down, as if he was home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil glanced at him and muttered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or three pieces of sugar, one Spoon milk? You are a guy who likes sweets, which is not good for your teeth and body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, I am just drinking coffee. I like to be sweeter, and when I cook steaks and grilled meat, I prefer rose seasoning, black pepper and cumin.” Klein always felt that he was a full-flavor party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil quickly made coffee and pushed the past:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a break Or do you start directly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me calm for a few minutes, the captains have the information of Terry's whereabouts, are rushing to the steam train station, do not know What's the result..." Klein exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the information detailed? Determine which one "Work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, not sure." Klein snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Nielton laughed: "In this case, the probability of unsuccessful is much higher than the possibility of success, and Teres should have sequence 7, This level of extraordinary is not so easy to be caught, huh, don't think about relying on divination, divination is not omnipotent, you will only get a symbol, accidentally interpret the mistake, or ignore what."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein recalls this mistake again and hears it deeply. He nodded from the heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, divination is not a panacea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing this sentence, he suddenly stunned, his body and mind suddenly entered a certain state of mind, so later Slightly lean, trying to exhale, but at this time, his ears suddenly sounded an illusory broken sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly discovered that something seems to be dissolved in the body, in harmony with his own spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an indescribable unique feeling, and Klein half-closed his eyes and quietly realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the reminder of others, he knows that this is a manifestation of the digestive of the divination potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tassok River passes through the city of Tingen A small town called Viña, the first steam train to Beckland after leaving Tingen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the platform, Terry changed her long white dress, wearing a round-brimmed hat, and the fine black gauze hangs from the brim. Covering her most of her face, her appearance became embarrassing and difficult to identify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
