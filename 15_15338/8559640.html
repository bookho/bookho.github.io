			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is running too fast...I just had an idea... Klein looked at the undulating sea and couldn’t return to it for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a speculation in his flashing light:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The King of Undead" Agari The second officer of the map, the "slaughter" Gilhies suspected of "devil", even "desire apostles", has the extraordinary ability to detect danger in advance and lock the source of danger, then, "the king of immortality" will itself be the "devil" "The sequence of the route 4 half god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, after the 'Future' people have the idea of ​​actually jeopardizing his strength and putting it into practice, he immediately sensed the problem and found out The existence of the 'mysterious queen' did not hesitate to make a decision to retreat?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, this shows that the 'mysterious queen' just had the urge to shoot, Otherwise, my thoughts alone will only make the 'immortal king' sneer twice, madly counterattack...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哎, the 'devil' approach Extraordinary ability is really easy to use. If you want to dig a hole to bury the 'immortal king', or his chief, second and third deputy, it is almost impossible..." Klein felt a sigh of relief and looked at the station sideways. Next to Anderson Hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of the strongest hunter still has obvious distortions. It seems that he is desperate for his bad luck and has not weakened, and he is different from the "death". Just fleeing with the tail, giving the impression that the script was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his eyes and looked at his eyes with a guess. It seems to be related. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Anderson’s bad luck is not strong enough, otherwise he will be able to sacrifice him and successfully catch the “King of Undead”... Oh, this is not Is it the correct use of the "provocative"? Klein turned into the hallway and returned to his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just pushed the wooden door open and saw a familiar back standing in front of the window. The figure is very good, and the dress is slightly weird. It is the "mysterious queen". Bernard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Did your father not teach you? Don't just enter someone else's room, especially the room of a strange man? As a lady with a good tutor, you should wait at the door and sincerely ask if I can come in... Great, you haven't remembered any educational books? Klein silently spit a few words and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he spoke, the "mysterious queen" Bernard 背 spoke to him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The previous things have confirmed my thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What thoughts?" Klein suppressed curiosity and asked indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berner did not turn his head and looked out at the sea level road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agari The legend of '不老泉' is a scam.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is a 'not old spring', it will only be one of the main materials of the 'not old witch', or from Their bodies were born, so any person who is a man but claims to have drunk 'not old spring' is lying. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't explain what "no old witch" is, it seems that she is sure that Gilman Sparo knows, or even if he doesn't understand, there is a place afterwards. Inquiring.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"不老泉"... "Not the old witch"...is quite corresponding...so, the blood on the sailboat next to the ruins is thinking Telling the world that "not the old spring is a scam"? "The king of immortality" Agarito once again released the news of "not old spring", tricking adventurers and pirates into dangerous seas, self-burial of life, or taking the opportunity to slaughter? Strong demon Style... No wonder the "slaughter" Gilthias wants to warn me, let me not intervene... Klein thought for a few seconds, deliberately using a grinning tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Scam..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mysterious queen" Bernard nodded, his voice softly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused and seemed to have made a silent sigh before she spoke: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the sequence of his route is called 4, 'Devil'." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil"? It sounds very sly... The behavior of the treasure scam is perfect in line with the "devil" style... Klein is amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "mysterious queen" turned his body, and the gaze of the fine gauze looked out at the eyes of German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s my turn to provide information? Klein pondered for two seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the limited diary analysis, Russell’s emperor suffered an extremely serious dilemma in his later years, which forced him to try to be crazy. The idea of ​​behavior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, he is very calm, because the diary he currently receives does not reveal what Russell’s emperor wanted to do in his later years. What kind of dilemma, what crazy behaviors have been done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he provided this information also hinted at Bernard, who wanted to figure out the truth, then took the diary of Russell’s key period to the star. Will be "Jia De Li Ya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mysterious Queen" Bernard was silent for a few seconds without speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is moving over the clouds, and the sun is shining outside. The queen of the five seas suddenly separated like a pile of soap bubbles, broken and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light reflected by the bubble is divided into different colors, creating a fairy-tale fantasy scene in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no "hidden sage", the "sneak peek" approach is really interesting... Klein feels a little while squatting with his left thumb The first joint of the index finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the hidden vision of the "spirit of the spirit" and found no extra black lines in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that the "mysterious queen" Bernard has indeed left! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein breathed a sigh of relief and quickly turned off this vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was trying to rest in bed for a while, and suddenly heard the light footsteps approaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚, his door was awakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Klein rolled over and sat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I." "The star above" Jia Delia's voice came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned over with some doubts and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t ask what was going on, looked at each other indifferently, and his eyes showed everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia De Li Ya pushed the heavy glasses on the bridge of the nose:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From that sea It won't go back to where you used to go. It's less than 100 nautical miles from Toscat Island. Going to Nassis for three days, where do you want to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Going in or out is not in one place? Klein was slightly upset, and the confirmation asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can that enter the sea from here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it will fall directly into the gap that cuts the bottom of the ocean. The divination results show that the people who do this are really dead." Jia Delia explained briefly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way... Klein thought for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to Tosta. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he did not choose Nasse was because he was close to calling the next Tarot party. He did not want to do this on the "Future". It takes a lot of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Jia Delia has no opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she turned her head and walked to the captain’s room, Klein shook her head in a small amount and sighed in her heart:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you come early, you will encounter the 'mysterious queen'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, the "Future" arrived at the port of Toskat Island and forcibly docked at the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein dressed as a Lun gentleman, carrying a leather suitcase, went to the deck, put the tails of the two pockets and took them out, handed them to "Star above will" Jia De Li Ya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deducting the extraordinary character of the "fighting home" is 700 pounds, which is 1,300 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Klein’s cash wealth is only 8436 pounds plus 5 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Delia was silent and opened his mouth and seemed to want to say something, but in the end there was no opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you here, or somewhere else?" She turned to Anderson Hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that Gilman Sparo is about to leave, thinking of this as a pirate ship, and thinking of hunting a lot of pirates, Anderson immediately put up a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can pay for the boat." Jia Delia did not Anderson even let him wash his clothes and borrowed them from the pirates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Anderson did not hide his distressed expression and reached out and pulled off a common button in the middle of the shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reluctantly handed over the past:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my only in that sea area The remaining harvest comes from the body of a Luen military explorer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know its original name, only based on the demonstrated ability and The name of the corresponding sequence 6 is called it, um, 'Judge'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The negative effect is not particularly strong, that is, it is easy for the wearer to offend people or monsters, and perhaps one of the gods is accidentally stared." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not particularly strong? If I am "on the star", I will definitely choose your sword... Klein swears a few words and sees that Carréa has accepted the money paid by Anderson Hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not care about other people’s affairs, carrying a suitcase, leaving the “Future” and boarding the dock on Toskat Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson Hood jumped directly from the edge of the deck and fell to his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But a drink? Celebrate that we finally left the damn waters!" The hunter was very excited and very easy to invite. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein swept him and expressed his rejection with his eyes, just how far away from the guy who was riddled with this doom and his own aura. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Anderson glanced around and cleared his throat. "Can you lend me some money? You know, my harvest is mine." The cash sinks in the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Reassured, I will return you tomorrow morning. There are also many pirates in Toskat's bars and brothels. I intend to ask them to help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you don’t have a bounty, you will extort money, and if you have a bounty, you can take it directly? Klein snorted in his heart and took out the 5th Sule's banknotes and handed it to Anderson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So little?" Anderson half-mouthed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
