			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey simply mentioned the old song, but did not repeat the specific content, afraid of being seen by the "hidden" lady Guess the specific area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just talked about her own inspiration, and by "psychological suggestion", staying awake in the dream, began a very fantastic journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychological hints? She knows how to make psychological hints? She should be a sequence 7 "psychologist" ... "hidden" Jia De Li Ya habitually made a judgment, but immediately had a deeper doubt:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Then why should she buy the extraordinary characteristics of the 'psychologist'?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Repeated feeding is limited, and it is easy to get out of control, and it will be the potion Digestion causes obstacles...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to make magical items? But this coincides with her extraordinary ability and does not have any use value.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to give someone? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Guardian's speculation, Audrey has said that she has come to the edge of her consciousness through a messy dream, and then follows the "fool" Mr. The learned "real law" has created a step down the ladder, gradually deepening into the submarine field like the underwater iceberg.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not Describe in detail the various subconscious light spots that I have seen, because that involves some secrets that she is unwilling or shy to tell others.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She focuses on The kind of loneliness, long, can not find the target, the surrounding gray and the seemingly hidden extreme feelings of various monsters, mentioning their emotions several times on the verge of collapse, relying on their extraordinary ability to barely support Finally, he arrived in the illusory ocean formed by the subconscious minds of the living beings.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imprint of memory from human ancestors, the mapping and spread of various consciousnesses of surrounding creatures here, Audrey’s mouth is very organized, and it’s not too fast or slow. It is fixed in the dragon with grey rock-like scales flying through the collective subconscious sea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are actually dragons living in the collective subconscious sea? It’s a magical and magnificent journey! Although Miss Justice has not encountered any enemies and dangers, it still gives me a sense of illusion... “Magician” Foer’s mind has flashed a title: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Justice" Dream Traveler<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the story, "Justice" Audrey Look around the circle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ladies and gentlemen, what advice do you have? Do you think that the dragon's ‘miracle city’ Levished is also hidden in this collective subconscious sea? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do I need to pay attention to if I want to continue exploring? What do I need to prepare in advance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "After hanging down," Alger looked at the "hidden" and sank the following: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think you should continue to explore.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a very dangerous behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" According to the records, most of the dragons are flesh-and-blood creatures, including the soul dragon. They can survive and swim in the so-called bio-collectives. The subconscious sea shows that the dragon you saw has a sequence high enough to reach the semi-god level.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before you sequence 5, don't consider this Aspects of the problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hidden" Jia Delia nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the collective subconscious ocean There are many dangerous things in it. The evil thoughts accumulated by human beings, the desires that will erode the spiritual body, the horror memories from ancient times are like the storms and waves on the real ocean, which will bring you serious psychological trauma and even let You can no longer wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, that is the collective subconscious ocean of all living things, not just humans, maybe some evil spirits, some evil spirits, some horrible consciousness Hidden there, like a huge whirlpool that can engulf a ship.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before you truly gain the extraordinary ability to walk in the ocean of collective subconscious, don't rush to explore. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of expectations, "justice" Audrey was disappointed, but had to admit that "inverted man" and "invisible" Ms. said it makes sense and is sincere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a breath and said to herself in her heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Audrey, can't Wayward, wait for the sequence 5 to try again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not consider how difficult it is to become a sequence 5, at this level, even at Compete for the seven generals at sea, or let seven become eight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Audrey’s view, there is a “fool”, in the case of the Tarot, he should be careful, calm, and not risky. Within two years, you should be able to reach this level smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the half-god and half-man's door is difficult to push open! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. "Hidden" knows a lot, very knowledgeable... "Justice" Audrey holds the last hope and looks at the bronze long table At the top of Mr. "The Fool", I hope that this spiritual level of existence can provide advice different from the "inverted man" and "invisible" ladies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't look at me...I don't understand! Klein tried not to let his eyes blink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His perception of conscious, subconscious, and collective subconsciousness remains in the theory described by the "Psychic" Dai Li, without further understanding. After being invaded by dreams and regaining consciousness, I did not even think about exploring the world beyond dreams. This made him give advice to Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he has a natural idea of ​​this, can be uncertified, do not know whether it will be effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, if he is not sure, he can blurtly put a few words on the side, but at this time, "the star above will" Jia Delia is watching More to say, more mistakes, less to say less, not to say good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a new member of great pressure...” “The Fool” Klein sighs secretly, without opening his mouth, keeping his eyes smiling. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not above the fog, not in the form of a spirit, he suspects that this difficulty of acting will make the muscles around his eyes paralyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool" did not recommend... Audrey took a bit of disappointment and no longer imagined exploring the collective subconscious ocean as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "moon" Emlin, who could not wait to wait, cleared his throat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have carefully studied the history that our blood family has handed down..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood...it is only a vampire...cultivating vampires and pulling vampires into the earth is really the goddess of the earth The tradition of the church... "The Hidden" Jia Delia seems to be nodding in a serious listening position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, she feels that one of her cognitions may need to be adjusted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Moon' shows the identity straightforward... Does this mean that Mr. 'Footer' has a strong deterrent in the outside world, so members are not afraid to disclose information?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I don't seem to need to hide my situation completely..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin paused, looking sideways at the "sun" and raised his chin: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the Cataclysm, there was no Silver City, only the country of silver! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other people to question, "Sun" Dairik will definitely be busy, indicating that the people of Silver City are descendants of the country of silver, indicating themselves Without lying, he could look at Mr. "Moon" and feel his pride. Dairik twisted his head and looked at the other side, disdain to explain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why should you let this arrogant arrogant, vampire who does not recognize the history of Silver City believe? He muttered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his reaction, Emlin looked The Silver City really had a relationship with the country of silver, so he snorted: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The silver country originally believed not the giant king Olmer, but his queen. Omega. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Omega Bella? "Sun" Dairik turned back to his head and blurted out: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We didn't record this in Silver City, nor did we record the Queen's Queen called Omega." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin immediately smiled and spread the door:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I said you guys There is a missing omission in the history of Silver City. No problem?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Obviously, the history of the blood family you recorded is wrong. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......In order to prove this thing... I should say that your vampire is clear in logic, still quite vengeful? Klein resisted funny Emotions, don't let yourself look at Emlin White.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dispute between "Moon" and "Sun" made him gain a lot, knowing the Queen of the Giants, "Bumper "Goddess" is called Omibella.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik is about to refute Mr. "Moon", but hears the "Hidden" lady opening:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ou Meera is the second harvest of the 'Blood Goddess' and the queen of the giant Wang Ting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is rumored that he has fallen at the end of the Second Age, but cannot be confirmed because no one has seen her body and relics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Harvest Goddess" is really called Omibella... "The Sun" Dairik is there, he wants to refute, but because this thing really confirms the Silver City There are many omissions in history that cannot be opened, and it is very wrong for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moon" Emlin saw it, only felt comfortable, and the sense of pleasure rose from the depths of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another exchange, Tarot will come to an end, and Klein smiled slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Everyone, see you next week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow your will." "Justice" Audrey immediately got up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are not slower, including the "hidden" Jia Delia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to reality, "Star above will" Jia Delia looked The broken star-like instrument placed on the eye desk carefully reminiscent of what happened in the party just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some details convince her that Tarot will involve a lot, not simple, and the "fool" in the depths of the fog, like that heavy shadow Looking at the world behind the scenes, it is difficult to see, it is difficult to speculate, I do not know what to plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia De Li Ya was silent for ten seconds, took out a pen and paper and wrote: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Recently, some people are consciously collecting the Diary of the Great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dare not touch the Tarot Society in the letter, dare not reveal a little information, afraid of being "fool" Mr. Punishment can only be reminded of things that can usually be found and signs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After writing and folding, she took out a delicate harmonica made of gold that she carried with her, put it on her lips and blew it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a slap in the eye, she saw the letter disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if she did not wear glasses, she could not find the arrival of the messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Jia Delia whispered, and the detective touched his forehead and said silently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"It is really stressful to join a party under the watchful eye of a god."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a 'star above' will join, my 'fool' is under great pressure..." Klein smashed his forehead on the fog and returned directly to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to experiment with the inspiration from Miss Justice’s exploration of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
