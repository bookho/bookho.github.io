			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver City, Mortuary Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick stood in front of the steps, his eyes staring red and looking at the parents lying in the two coffins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slate in front of him was filled with a simple silver straight sword, which shook the straight sword that shook slightly in the thunder of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Burg couple in the coffin has not really died yet, they are trying to squint their eyes, sometimes violently and sometimes gasping, but in some people’s eyes, Their glory of life is bleak in uncontrollable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Derick, do it!" An old man in a black robe and a hard cane looked at the boy whose face was almost distorted, and said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, no!" Dairik, with brown hair, shook his head continuously, and stepped back every time he said a word. At the end, it was a tear. The heart screams like a lung. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man slammed his cane:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want people all over the city Are you buried for your parents?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should be very clear that we are the dark people abandoned by God and can only live in this cursed place, all The deceased will become a horrible evil spirit, no matter what method is used, it is difficult to reverse, except that those who have the same blood will end their lives personally!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Why? Why?” Dairik shook his head in despair and asked, “Why are our people in the Silver City, who were born to be destined to kill the mother...”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man closed his eyes and seemed to remember what he had experienced in the past: "...this is our fate, this is the curse we bear, this is the will of God..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put up your sword, Dairik, this is respect for your parents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After that, when you calm down, you can try to become a blood warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Berg in the coffin wants to open, but after a few chests It can only emit the sound of the lotus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick strode hard and returned to the side of the silver straight sword, trembled and extended his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold touch was introduced into his brain, reminding him of the blood ice that his father brought back when he was hunting. Only the size of the palm would cool the room. a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes flashed through the stern father who taught the swordsmanship, flashed his father who slaps his back dust, and flashed the gentle mother who sewed the clothes. After flashing the face of the mutant monster, the brave mother in front of her, flashed a family around, swaying candlelight, sharing the picture of food...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜...There was a sound in his throat that was suppressed to the extreme, low to the extreme, and his right hand slammed hard and pulled up the straight sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He buried his head and rushed to the front, holding up the straight sword and tying it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! In a painful scream, blood spilled out and splashed on Deric's face, splashing into his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was bright red in his eyes, pulled up the straight sword, and plunged into the coffin next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp metal penetrated the body, and Dairik let out his hand and staggered and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not go to the situation in the two coffins, as if chased by the evil spirits, stumbled and ran out of the morgue hall, his hands clasped tightly His teeth were biting, and the blood red on his face was rushed out of the traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哎..." The old man who watched all of this sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sun, no moon, no stars, only the constant darkness and the lightning that tears everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the lightning, the people of the Silver City traveled to the dim road, and the hours when the lightning subsided every day were considered by them to be The legendary real night, this time, you need candles to illuminate the city, to dispel the darkness, to guard the monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick’s eyes went straight through the street, not thinking about where the destination was, but he walked and found himself returning to his doorstep. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take out the key, unlock the padlock, push the door, he saw everything familiar, but did not hear the mother’s concern, nor did he encounter his father’s The scolding of running around, the house was empty and deserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick clenched his teeth again and hurried back to his room, looking again at the city-state that was said to have been destroyed for a long time by his father. A crystal ball that worships the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squatted down, facing the crystal ball, praying without any hope, praying painfully:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great God, please re-focus on this abandoned place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great God, Please let us the dark people get rid of the curse of fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing to dedicate my life to you and please you with my blood." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and over again, just as he was completely desperate and wanted to stand up, he saw There was a deep red glow in the pure crystal ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This light is like running water, and it instantly drowns Dairik. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his initial restoration of consciousness, he found himself standing in a palace with a huge pillar of stone, in front of an ancient and mottled bronze long table, long Opposite the table is a seated person with a thick fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are nothingness, ethereal, and empty surroundings, and the bottom is filled with the invisible gray fog and the unreal dark red spots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a flame in the heart of Dairik’s heart that was ignited, and he looked puzzledly at the shadow of the seat on the front:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, are you gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the question, he remembered the book of the city of silver In one sentence, I quickly lowered my head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sentences are:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not look directly at God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned back and held his hands crossed, replied leisurely and easily in Giant's language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I am not a god, I am just a fool who is interested in a long history."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already scorned the left side of the teeth twice and found the etheric body of the boy in front of him. The surface of the star spirit is mottled and there is no unity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the other party is not an extraordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stupid...Dyrick chewed the word, and it took a long time to say it with silence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Whether you are a god or a fool, my prayers don't change. I hope that everyone in the Silver City will get rid of the curse of fate, hope that the sky will appear, and the sun described in those books will appear. If, if I can, I hope that I The parents can be resurrected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, I am not a wishing machine... Klein loosened his hands and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I help you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick stunned for a long time:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
