			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday morning, the weather kept the usual coldness of the season. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein tightened the neckline of the coat, put on his hat, and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a letter to the Stuart Detective who sent the post to the street, the distance is not far away, no need to dress so neat, so thick, but Klein had a cold, and when he was insured, he still wrapped himself up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it was a night of windy nights, Beckland’s air was surprisingly good, and Klein slowed down and enjoyed this rare morning. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road was over the Ergen family, he heard the sound of the open belly window, and the instincts turned and looked at the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing at the window is Mrs. Doris wearing a black plush bonnet and a gray-blue thick scarf. Compared with before, her face is again Something is worse, and the figure is getting more and more embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, detective Moriarty, thank you for taking care of Brody during this time, it said that you are a good person, yes, Brody?" The old lady Doris bent down and picked up the green cat with green eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brodi used four feet to struggle, and struggled in her arms. Finally, it jumped down and fell lightly on the window sill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it didn’t leave, but it’s going around there, with Mrs. Doris on the side of her head, looking at Klein’s eyes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a good card issued by a cat? Klein laughed at himself and said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a happy thing, and even more pleased, Mrs. Doris is finally discharged from hospital. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few words of chilling, he quit with a smile and continued to walk towards the end of the street with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps, he heard Mrs. Doris shouting behind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am equal to Ergen, I will let him give you the reward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Is it for the money to pick up this task? The smile on Klein’s face suddenly stiffened. He could only turn his body halfway and waved his hand to signal that he knew it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After away from the Jürgen family, his expression gradually condensed, and there was a slight sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just opened the spirit to see the color of Mrs. Reiss’s gas field and found that the situation is not very good, which is because the other party is older and also because of Baekeland. Germany's cold climate and poor air have a very bad effect on lung disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Doris should be able to get through this late autumn plus winter, but next, next, it’s hard to say... want to live a few more years I'm afraid I have to move to the South and move to Desi Bay. Unfortunately, Jurgen lawyers should not have that condition... I haven't been to Desi Bay yet... Klein sighed a few words. Find the mail box and plug it in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be the preface to the performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he will go to the Harvest Church as a detective in the evening to do the rest preparations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, after buying a Desi pie for breakfast, Klein returned the same way, quite leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he was close to the house, he saw an elegantly decorated carriage parked outside, and two ladies wearing satin black hats were holding the doorbell anxiously The maids and bodyguards are scattered around, as if they are guarding against anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Starling...Mrs. Mary...do they have something to entrust? Very urgent look... Klein took the paper bag with Desi pie and leaned over, hehe smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two ladies, this should be breakfast Time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing back is Sherlock. Moriarty Detective, Mrs. Mary is obviously relieved:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Detective, you have to help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Kline’s vision, the other’s anxiety, nervousness and fear were not false. So he nodded and pointed to the gate:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he glanced at the landlord's wife, Starling, and found that the state of the other party was completely different from the previous two days, and it became very low and very sad. It seems that I am not interested in anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this happening? Although the landlord likes to show off a little, but still very passionate about life... Kline took out the key and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering, without waiting, Mrs. Mary couldn’t wait to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mori Detective Yatti, I received a threatening letter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism? Klein puts the Desi pie and hands on his hands:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the content of the letter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Mary looked at Mrs. Starling sideways and saw that she was not as active as usual, so she had to consider it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I am required to treat the smoke of the factory fairly when I do the air pollution investigation, and affirm their contribution. Otherwise, I will be the same as the doll sent by the letter...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The doll's head was taken off and the hands and feet were broken. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Mary seems to recall the feeling of opening the letter, the voice trembled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is the first time I have encountered a similar thing. I don't know if it will become a reality. I don't know that it is a member of the investigation committee to bear this kind of thing. I don't know..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Maybe Russell the Great once said that there is only one of the most extreme hatred between people. One is to murder the other’s parents, and the other is Destroyed others to make money... Kline’s expression was serious and he said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My suggestion is, alarm. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, Mrs. Mary is now a member of the Kingdom’s Air Pollution Investigation Committee, and her status is very different from that of her before, for the intimidation she suffered, the police department. I will definitely not wait for it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this involves the formulation of important policies of the kingdom, not ordinary things, so the police department will transfer the case to the church with great probability. Organize, so as to solve the case as soon as possible, and resolve it as soon as possible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the identity of Mrs. Mary’s goddess, the night is an inevitable choice.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, Klein would not be involved if he wanted to get a share of the reward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have done this, but This does not make me feel at ease. "Mrs. Mary licked her lips. "Do you know what they say? The threatening letter is made up of tailoring newspaper words. The dolls are the ones that can be bought everywhere. It is difficult to find the senders in a short time! And I only plan to send a policeman to protect me! Goddess, are they treating a helpless citizen for help? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Mary paused and looked at Klein: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mori Detective Yatti, I believe that you can help me, not only because of your performance in that matter, but also because of Mike's approval, Allen's praise, Tallim's praise. And I know that you have made outstanding contributions in the serial killings. Don't worry, I will pay you enough. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your words make me feel happy, but things seem a bit wrong...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless the police The departments have already been bought, otherwise they should transfer the case to the night occupants. In the case of extraordinary means such as divination, the letters that are put together in the newspapers are not evasive, and the senders have either been caught or have The method interferes with divination... and the latter causes the night-timers to formally and massively intervene...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In either case, it is not the same as the current one... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not immediately answer Mrs. Mary and carefully analyzed the anomaly that this event showed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The living room suddenly became very quiet, and the feeling of silence made Mrs. Mary and Mrs. Starling somewhat uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t know when to pull out a coin and let it jump between his fingers, which seemed to be his habitual action when he concentrated on thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the coin flew up and fell steadily, falling to the palm of the hand, with the back facing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is surprised. He is divining whether this is dangerous or not. The result is no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is such a threat, even if the sender has little strength, it may cause certain dangers, not completely without... just pure intimidation? Or... Klein suddenly thought of another possibility, smiled and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Mary, don't be nervous, you can go back with confidence, if someone looks for these two days If you discuss this matter and let the people recognize the true face of the factory owners and ignite the public's anger, then you will have nothing to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Klein had just thought of might be that this incident of threatening the letter was a bureau, and the bureau set by himself was to incite the people and use their anger to make the investigation of air pollution go smoothly, so that the subsequent bill would benefit itself. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This explains why the police department is currently responding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Why do you say that?" asked Mrs. Mary frowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kline smiles and responds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my reasoning."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What if you didn't happen in two days?" asked Mrs. Mary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sincerely said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will provide protection."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no danger anyway... he added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reassuring Mrs. Mary, he confirmed it on the fog and got the same result as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, his Desi pie is already cold...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Mary is a little embarrassed and uneasy to return home, thinking about whether or not to ask Stalin to stay for a few days to accompany herself. At this time, her butler told her that the eldest son of Earl, the chief secretary of the Air Pollution Investigation Commission, Mr. Hibbert Hall, visited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the living room, Mrs. Mary will still have a chance to speak in the future. The handsome blonde gentleman will be the first to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Mary, I heard about your experience, this is the shame of Beckland, or even the whole kingdom, I apologize and sympathize with it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You rest assured that everyone on the committee will stand with you! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your concern." "Mrs. Mary responded gratefully.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert Hall considered the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Madam, I want to find a reporter to interview this matter, tell your story, tell everyone that despicable bad deeds, and let the public see how crazy those who pollute Beckland's air are! No regrets! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please be sure to agree to my request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...and Moriarty The detective described exactly the same... Mrs. Mary couldn’t speak for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used breakfast, rested for a while, idle nothing Ryan entered the fog and prepared to divinate the origin of the biotoxin bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he did not delay at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
