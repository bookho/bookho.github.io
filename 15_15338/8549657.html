			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey recalls the words of his father and his brother when discussing the situation, and they play their own way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "They think that the structure of the government is too chaotic. Every time the election is completed, as long as there is a change of partisanship, a group of people will be changed from top to bottom, making things a mess and extremely inefficient, which not only causes the defeat of the war. It also caused great inconvenience to the people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is very clear, because there is no reference object, the Lun Kingdom has not evolved civil servants at this time. The examination system, the form of political party governance is still in its infancy, so after the election victory, many so-called transactional positions will be rewarded to members and supporters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Russell’s inventor didn’t invent this system in the way, it’s not in line with his character... Is it that he will shift his focus later? Going somewhere else? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Upside down” Alger heard this and smiled and inserted a sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They think? They feel really dull. Maybe they will feel itchy after a black bite bite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black mosquito is Lu A creature in the southern part of the kingdom of the kingdom, known for its toxic nature, which makes people hate and smash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey reached out to the palm of his hand and covered his mouth. He ignored the ridicule of "downside down" and threw out the core of the news:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, they can't find a good way to replace this system for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listens quietly I feel that the topic has entered the field that I am good at, and smiled slightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a simple question."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Eater Empire, and the corrupt country that learns to eat the empire, have very successful advanced experiences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Simple?" Audrey asked a little strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although her tutoring course does not include politics, she often listens to her father, brother, etc., and she has enough understanding in similar aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein seems to have returned to the previous forum, calmly laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exam, just like Like the college entrance exam, there is a test for all the public, which can be divided into two rounds, or three rounds, to screen out the elite in the most objective way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But..." Audrey vaguely knew what kind of opposition it would bring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without giving her the opportunity to organize her language, Klein continued: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After, use these The elite fills the cabinet, the county government, the city government, and the town's transactional position, um, that is, the location of direct work, such as the cabinet senior secretary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Different requirements for different locations can be tested separately and in different ways in the second or third round, and professional matters must be handed over to professionals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The administrative position of the minister, the county governor and the mayor is reserved for the winning party, which is the cake they deserve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Alger, who lacked enough interest in this issue, unknowingly passed his head and listened carefully. Audrey frowned and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t rush to replace everyone, the cabinet and all levels of government will be jealous, you can take an exam every year or three years, gradually change, after that, Revisiting the expansion of the kingdom and the resignation of government employees and the vacancies brought about by the old, the quota is planned." Kline has fully utilized the characteristics of his keyboard politician. At the end of the show, "this design can maximize the Wang’s domestic elites are included in the government, and no matter which party is in power, no matter who the minister is, the officers can keep the kingdom basic and relatively effective.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the side effect is the birth of the bureaucratic undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is to say, even if those ministers become curls, it will not have much impact?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Alger took the initiative to interject, " I think that curling is a better choice than the current minister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After all, the curls only need to eat, sleep, and mate, don't give a stupid idea, and don't stick to a plan without a brain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Inverted man", it sounds like you have a bad boss... Kline sat on the top and smiled and shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey reminisced about the description of Mr. Fool’s just now, and it’s been a while for a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This sounds like it really works..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a very simple but effective way!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks to Klein and sincerely admire:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool, you must be a life-savvy, intelligent and long-lasting "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein’s mouth twitched and looked at “downside down” and “justice”, silent for a few seconds:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today's party is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Miss "Justice" can influence her relatives, push When this happened, I would guide Benson in advance and give him the opportunity to become a "civil servant." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking carefully, Benson is really suitable for this trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, "justice" should not take the initiative to do it, because then, I and the "downside down" asked about which nobleman proposed. Basically can guess her true identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, she can circle a circle and use a more subtle approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow your will." Audrey and Alger got up at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned back and cut off the connection, only to see the "justice" and "downside down" illusory blurred figure quickly broken and dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, in the grand hall of the gods' home, there is only one who sits quietly on the bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not fall directly into the fog like the last time, leaving here, because he has become an extraordinary person, still enough spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he ended the "Tarot Club" in advance was because he knew the true attitude of the "Night" to the Antignus family notes. Waiting to make a serious look, instead of lying down to sleep, it will be Dunn Smith who doubts what they have done at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And today’s harvest is not too small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat on the high back chair on the bronze long table, with his arms resting on the armrests, and his fingers crossed his eyes to calmly look at the flawless fog. I only feel that it is empty and silent, as if no one has been on foot for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was keenly aware of one thing when he established the connection and “summoned” the projections of “justice” and “downside down”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the self as the extraordinary person, and have the strength to touch another "dark red star"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, can you "call" another one?" Klein recalled that feeling, and almost self-talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn’t have an impulse to try before, because he didn’t know what identity the newcomer would be and what attitude he would have. After all, no one can be like “justice.” Like the "inverted man", because of the unique character, it is easy to hide. If it is similar to Dunn Smith, then the newly established "mysterious organization" will be immediately exposed. The gaze of the church is "under." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Klein knows that this fog is very special, understand that it is not the extraordinary person of the sequence of Dunn Smith can "crack", but the problem is that since there is extraordinary power, you have to consider the existence of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is now cautiously convinced that the seven orthodox gods are actually there. Of course, he prefers that these gods are only stronger and more powerful than the high sequencers. And subject to some strict restrictions, at least since the fifth period, in addition to a few gods, they have no more deeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, forcing people to pull is also a bad thing, no one wants to be inexplicably involved in mysterious events... or wait until later..." Klein Sighed and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He unfolds his own spirituality, senses the existence of the body, and then begins to imitate the heavy feeling of the rapid fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the light and shadow, the fog and the deep red moments go away. Klein seems to have penetrated the endless water film and finally saw the real world. I saw the dimness of the full house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he was completely awake and experienced the process seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Strange... The fog and the spirit world are still a little different..." Klein moved his hands and felt the truth of flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He earnestly realized for a while, shaking his head to the desk and stretching his curtains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swipe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtains are retreating, the sun shines, and the room is bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the streets outside the window and the pedestrians coming and going, Klein took a breath and said to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's time to go out and work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do I play the 'Divination'?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can't be too urgent... I will only be able to see it for the time being..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Queens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey Hall saw himself in the mirror and saw the cheeks that were excited to the blush and the eyes that were so bright that people could not look straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She refused to look at these, hurry back to think about it, then lift the pen with the gemstone, brush and write the "spectator" on the delicate parchment Formula:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"80ml pure water, 5 drops of colchicine essence, 13 grams of burdock powder, 7 petals of elves, a pair of adult Manhale fish The eyes, the blood of 35 ml of black horned black fish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Audrey spit out, repeated several times, and finally confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has the urge to dance, but tells herself to be reserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it, she began to write the names of various chemicals around the potion formula, disguising this page as a complicated and confusing scientific knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, as long as you don’t read it consciously, people who look at it will definitely not find my hidden details... awesome! Audrey self-reported a sentence and turned her thoughts to the material:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First look in several treasure houses of the family, no part can try Others exchanged it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is still not the case, you can only help the fool and the slinger at the next meeting... What is the reward?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking for a while, Audrey closed the note, put it on the small bookshelf in the bedroom, and then came to the door briskly On the side, opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A golden retriever dog is sitting just outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ao Lili’s mouth is upturned, revealing a bright smile like a sun:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
