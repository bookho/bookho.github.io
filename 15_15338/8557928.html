			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the "Justice" Miss makes people happy greetings, Klein's mouth is slightly tilted, gently beheaded, it is a response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is waiting to introduce Ms. "Hidden" to everyone and introduce everyone to Ms. "Hidden", but find that Miss "Justice" does not stop, look turned The other side: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, 'shang down man'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Once, she did not follow the order of the tarot cards, but followed the order of admission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After such a round of greetings, Ms. "Hidden" will know everyone, and I don’t need my "fool" to introduce another... "Miss is obviously deliberate. It is really heartfelt. The extraordinary people in the field of "audience" only need to be serious, and this is not the same in this respect... Klein first glimpsed, and immediately stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, "downside down" Alger responded to the "justice" Audrey's greetings while carefully examining the new members:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women, barely able to see that they are wearing black robes, there are many patterns on them... The hair color is black, the eyes are a little purple, and Alger is barely Looking for traits in the image of the other party's fuzzy distortion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his heart sank, and there was a scene in his mind that he saw at the pirate conference a few months ago:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The splendid starlight wonderfully built a long bridge between the huge sailboats and the palaces deep in the island, wearing the black wizard's robe of the "star above" Jia Delia strolling in the air , waist hanging star instrument and short scepter and other items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the astrological instrument feels a lot like the strange thing that Alger has gotten like a weather bottle, the latter after he was pulled into the party by Mr. Fool Surprisingly, it was broken by coincidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it her? The appearance is somewhat similar...however, 'the star will be 'wearing glasses, she doesn't...can't be sure, waiting for follow-up and looking Evidence, unfortunately, I just looked at her from afar and didn’t know much...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, I must be careful, try to exchange information as much as possible Don't reveal any details that relate to my real situation... 'World' is the leader of Mr. 'Footer', knowing his identity, and being known by others, no, other members, is absolutely different...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the 'Poseidon', the power of Mr. 'Footer' has greatly recovered, can you pull a pirate general-level powerhouse?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger has flashed an idea in his heart, and his sitting posture has changed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body language of Mr. "Hanging Man" told me that he was alert and in a defensive state... He knew the new lady, or guessed it. what? It’s really curious... “Justice” Audrey’s gaze swept away without a trace, and cast it to the “Sun” Dairik. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "hidden" Jia Delia was also cautiously and seriously reviewing the members of the Talo Society according to the order of greetings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious purple in her sorrow slowly and unpredictably, although she can’t really see through the blur and cover, she can recognize other people’s clothing. detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted man", a grown-up male, in his thirties, has a messy hair, like seaweed, a relatively rare dark blue, which is the "sailor" approach. A common variation... He is wearing a robe with storm and wave patterns... someone in the storm church? Jia Delia's pupils were miniature, and they left their eyes unobtrusively and continued to look at the rest of the members:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sun", a young man, may not yet be an adult The clothes are rare in style and have a simple aesthetic. It is quite tight and suitable for fighting. Is it an extraordinary person in this respect? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world" is not the old man, nor the teenager, the temperament is gloomy, wearing a hooded robes, hey, he has a feeling of being alive. Is this similar to Seignor, or "steel" Maviti? Or, other sequences that I don't know...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician", young women, wearing a common Lun style skirt, except for some lazy, no features This kind of person is the most easily overlooked, so it should be more concerned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of Mr. Tarot’s Tarot Club are not so simple. In the initial judgment, the two churches are involved... The “hidden” Jia Delia retracted his gaze and met with the just-seeking “justice” Audrey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the intent of the other party, she nodded lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hidden." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gederia uses Guvsak, deliberately not using the more accustomed Intis and Lunes, before communicating with Mr. Fool The same is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and she noticed a problem, and the meeting time that Mr. Fool had previously told was 3 pm on Monday in Bakerland time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this mean that the members of the party are currently based on the Lun? Jia De Li Ya has his own judgment on this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice." Audrey replied with a smile, "Good afternoon, 'The hidden person'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She has noticed the little tricks of the other party, and made a simple summary in her heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very cautious, experienced in the extraordinary world The woman, calm but not introverted, has confidence in her own observation or certain ability related to the eyes, while the clothing style and the short scepter hanging around the waist indicate that her sequence is more mysterious, which remains to be verified. Maybe it’s just a hobby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the "hidden" Jia Delia also saw the clothing of Miss Justice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She wears two hanging earrings, the pendant is small and exquisite, inlaid with high quality emerald, which is very lining her green eyes, the value is obviously very high...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The necklace on her neck is unique in style, dotted with diamonds that are difficult to count, but not exaggerated...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is white The waist dress is simple but beautiful, tailored and elegant, like the master fashion designer's handwriting...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details are everywhere, Jia Delia does not endure Live and close your eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17-year-old girl...very rich...Aristocrats who are suspected of being in a low status, Lun nobles? Jia Delia did not know why she sighed in her heart with a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Justice” Audrey’s round of greetings was completed without the need for Klein’s introduction. The original members of the Tarot Club met the “Invisible” lady. I was recognized by the "hidden". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just sitting still, Audrey once again turned to the top of the bronze long table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Footer', I have only collected a page of Russell's diary in the field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She provided two pages at the last meeting, still two The page can pay off the debt, but she is in the manor, even if she often goes to the city to be a guest, she only collects one page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, because of the addition of the new member "Miss", she cautiously did not mention "mental alchemy", did not mention Beckland, did not mention Dongche County. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell Diary...Diary? ! Jia De Li Ya almost couldn't help but quickly turn her head and looked at the "Justice" lady on the same side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clearly remembers that the tall and beautiful figure once sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The notes are his diary, but no one can understand them except him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tarot members know that Russell notes are diary? Is Mr. Fool collecting Russell's diary? He is doing this kind of cracking, trying to find hidden secrets in that history? This is more like a revived ancient god... Jia Delia’s thoughts are filled with doubts and shocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She keeps the surface calm, just looking at the first "transaction" sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
