			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After eight o'clock, Moretti's restaurant is inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the plate with only the shallow soup, Banson raised his hand and covered his mouth, and sat down with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although I have already eaten it for the third time, I still feel delicious enough, the sweet and sour tomato and the oxtail are elastic and very special. Perfectly integrated, Klein, I am really sorry that Blackthorn Security has lost a great chef to Tingen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa Back against the back of the chair, silently attached to the next point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just because you haven’t seen real cooking.” Kline said modestly. “If there is a chance, let’s go to the waves of Hows Street. The Nabba restaurant tastes the authentic Intis meal and goes to the coastline restaurant in the Jintongtong area to taste the taste of the South."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a restaurant that is often used in newspapers. The per capita consumption of the former is 1 pound and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I prefer what you do." Melissa answered without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I always feel the tomatoes you made What is the difference between the oxtail soup, perhaps, maybe it should not be paired with bread?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein agrees to nod:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The best partner for it should be rice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meat..." Melissa whispered, quite a few looks Divided into a longing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tingen in the northerly position, not the metropolitan Tingen, except for a few restaurants, it is difficult to eat rice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Benson and Melissa, this food is almost exclusively in the description of the newspaper, only in the occasional introduction of the textbook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the expression of his sister, Klein haha ​​smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for another six months Money, look for an opportunity to go to Desi Bay for a holiday and taste the food there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dixi Bay is located in the southernmost part of the Kingdom of Lun, one third It belongs to the Kingdom of Fenetport, where the sun is abundant and the scenery is pleasant. The paella is very famous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without waiting for Melissa to comment on thrift, Klein volunteered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Waiting for another three months, my salary will be greatly improved, and it can fully meet the needs of travel and money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Both Benson and Melissa were taken care of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein coughed twice and smiled and explained:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Based on my good professionalism The police department, which often cooperates with our company, also intends to ask my part-time history consultants. They will pay me another salary, at least 2 pounds per week. If you see me wearing a police uniform and come up with the corresponding documents, Don't be surprised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, as you all know, the efficiency of government departments is like the pace of a 90-year-old woman. They still need a long time. The process also needs an assessment of me. Therefore, I will often go to Hoy University on the rest day of the two months, find my mentor, find the faculty members, and learn more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the strange eyes of his brother and sister, he paused and his mouth opened slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The same as the words that Russell the Great said, live to the old and learn to be old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson Shen Silence for a few seconds, half of the feeling is half self-deprecating and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am still in college now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Knowledge really equals wealth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is equal to strength... Klein silently added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Banson, you need Klein's grammar books, you need his classical literature." Melissa greeted Klein with the words he wanted to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson’s expression seems to be changing, he bit his teeth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein You gave me those books tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if they help sleep again, I have to insist on reading one every day, no, one and a half. Hours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I swear in the name of the goddess! If I can't do it, I am a curler!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Klein hung his coat and hat on the coat rack of the lounge and walked into the ground according to the words conveyed by Roshan. All the way to the duty room outside the Chanis Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Dunn, players Lunfle, Siga, Luo Yao, Leonard and Cohen Li have all arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash sweeps through the door to the new night, Dunn smiles and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" We have a regular meeting every Thursday, summarizing the previous tasks and discussing the various problems faced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also experienced countless times The person who will test the case... Klein groaned and found a position to sit down and joked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need to introduce yourself first?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng laughed and turned to look at Cohenri:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You put Sirius Aripes The follow-up investigation is briefly mentioned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cohenli is also a night-time person converted from a civilian staff, not tall, brown hair is still thick, and the figure is quite Well-proportioned, the muscles are very strong, giving a savvy and strong feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We found the West with the help of Old Neil Reese's secret hiding point, there are a lot of books and articles on the scene, based on them, you can confirm that Sirius is a subordinate member of the secret organization 'Aurora Club' and is a 'secret person'."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is enough evidence to show that the Antignus family notes are sold by him and Henas. Vincent to Welch. People who don't remember Welch can ask for grams. Ryan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What we found, valuable items include three recipes for sequence potions, sequence 9 'divination', sequence 9' apprentice , Sequence 8 'Clown' '..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next task is to find out based on some of the letters that have not yet been destroyed and the usual circle of Sirius. Believed in the peripheral members of the "Aurora" of the evil spirits, the focus is on the cultist hidden in the police department."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, with Heiner Those who have contact also need to be re-examined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng gently decapitated and looked at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You also heard that we got the 'clown' potion formula, but for the time being we can't confirm whether it is true or not, we have to give us feedback in the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Aurora will be related to the task, you made the main, key contribution, plus the shooting of the members of the Secret Society, you don't even need to be long enough to get enough promotion, but I must remind You, not everyone is Dai Li, you have to endure the hunger, endure for three years, can not be affected by the 'clown' potion formula, so as not to get out of control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, this is the magic that you don't understand the "playing the law"... I used the divination method on the fog last night to initially confirm the correct formula of the "Clown" potion... Clay nodded honestly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will control my emotions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . With white hair Heitong, calm temperament "Midnight Poet" Xijiateang Road:; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp <br <br /> & nbsp />;"I still can't find the clue of 'teacher' Tries, I suspect he has fled Tingen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing was exchanged, Klein left the duty room, went to the old Neil to continue the occult course, and went to the fighting teacher Gao Wen in the afternoon to do the basic strength, endurance and overall coordination. Sexual training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is still brilliant five points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took off his practice clothes, took a quick shower, put on the original clothes, and took a public carriage to Besik Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not forget the red chimney seen in "Dream Divination" and did not forget to purchase the "audience" potion aids in the underground trading market, suspected of "psychological The men of the alchemy club, but this is not convenient to investigate with the power of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. 27, Henry Private Detective Agency... Yes, it is here." According to the description of the newspaper, Klein found a private home that is said to be trustworthy. Detective agency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put on a mask, lowered the top hat, erected the collar, and went up the stairs to the office on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚! He rang the half-covered door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please come in." A voice that seemed to contain the old man was heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, with a cane, pushed in and saw the detective firm adopt a semi-open format, with four employees, each sitting The board is separated from the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, I am detective Henry. Can I help you?" A man in a white shirt and black vest greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a pipe in his hand, his face is hard, his eyebrows are like a sword, and his dark blue eyes are professionally looking up and down the employer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein covers the small half of the face with a tall, windbreaker collar:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I have two things to entrust, don't know how you charge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This must look at the difficulty of the matter." Detective Henry retracted his gaze and pointed to the combination of sofas. In the hospitality area, "We went there to communicate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein followed him to the semi-detached place, sitting on the single sofa, did not take off The jacket did not remove the hat and did not remove the mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately dumbfounded: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first thing, I need you to help I investigated the chimneys of the houses in Tingen City, and made it clear who the landlord is and who the current residents are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stacked paper is unfolded after the red chimney with the color and the surrounding scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a picture that Klein once again uses the special and self-praying method above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This painting is so good..." Detective Henry subconsciously praised, slightly frowning. "This commission is not complicated, but it is cumbersome and needs A long cycle and a lot of helpers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Klein gently beheaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detective Henry indulged in a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"7 pounds, the price of this commission is 7 pounds, In addition, you have to give me at least two weeks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the second thing, help me find this gentleman, figure out his identity, The only information I know is that he occasionally appears in the Dragon Bar in the Docklands. Also, don't let him notice that he is a very sharp person with a terrible observation." Klein took another second. portrait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to reach out to members of the "Psychological Alchemy Club" to see if he could get valuable intelligence and materials, such as recipes that could be exchanged with "justice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
