			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 Minsk Street, washroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pulled out a sheet of paper from the dark pocket of the garment and shook it, turning it into a substitute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked the avatar to sit on the toilet, hold the newspaper in his hand, and blind others, so he hid in the shadows and took four steps back into the fog. on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This series of operations is magical than magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the grand palace, Klein sat on the top of the bronze long table and let Jason Beria’s handkerchief appear in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This is just a projection, but it can also be used for divination, provided that the handkerchief has not left his real-world body, the first divination in the city of Tingen. When the Holy Emblem, Klein used the projection. At that time, he did not know how to summon his own rituals, and he could not bring spiritual objects to the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, using projection and using the body to divination, there is still a big gap in the effect, so when using the body, Klein tries to use the body, but He is now being protected by the official extraordinary, and the ceremony is not so convenient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone is found to have a candle in the toilet during the day, it will be a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can really divinate the demon of Jason Beria, but the revelation is not clear enough, then I will take the risk, summon myself, take the handkerchief Come up... Klein sighed, with a parchment and a round pen, and wrote the divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jesson Beria's current Position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, relying on a handkerchief that the other party only used in a certain ceremony, it is impossible to divinate the target whereabouts and whereabouts, because the connection is not close enough And there is too much interference, for example, it is easy to provoke the abyss that the ritual points to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Klein, the interference can be ruled out. The so-called Abyss is the highest sequence of demons, not the abyss of the abyss. "And the object of his mysterious space above the fog is the gods of "eternal glory", "real creator", and the like, at least the angel-level "gate", and has not yet turned over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the problem of not being close enough, Klein, who can only get a certain amount of fog, can’t solve it. He can only try it, take a chance, maybe he After becoming a high-ranking saint in this field, there is a certain degree of certainty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is theoretically ok, after all, when the ceremony is held, the body, mind, and spirit state are the most unified, and it is the easiest to interact with the outside world... Expert Klein whispered, holding a handkerchief and writing a parchment with a divination statement, leaning back against the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly entered the state of meditation and continued to meditate on "Jason Beria's current position." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seven times, Klein fell asleep and came to the world of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray world, countless pictures are constantly flashing, interrupted each other, and extremely divergent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, a picture became clear and occupied Klein’s "vision", making him seem to have entered that dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream, the lights are dim, the desk is dark red, and a figure stands in front of the convex window, overlooking the garden outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a glass shed in the garden where the blossoming rose blooms and is red in the cold of December. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of the figure is projected onto the window. It is a medium-sized, brown-haired, brown-cold man with a skin age of thirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...I am not in the position of Divination Jason Beria? Who is this, I feel a little familiar... Klein was puzzled for a while, but did not think about it, letting the spirit continue to diverge, as if roaming a mysterious world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was confused and just fell, the man turned his body and walked to the corner of the room, where two large leather suitcases were placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banknotes that were exposed outside were all 10 pounds denominations, and the gold bars exude fascinating brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man pulled out something from the pocket of his suitcase and shook it and showed it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a slightly pale human skin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complete human skin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man quickly stripped himself and put the human skin on his body. It was only ten seconds before he became a tall, blue-brown, gray hair. Jason Beria combed after tidy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, the picture was broken, and Klein opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder Jason dares to take risks. In the past ten years, he has been wearing a human skin and never exposed the real appearance... It’s calm and cool. Crazy demon... Kline couldn't help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jason left his portrait in the house, did not let Essinger and others have doubts, because the surrounding residents have seen him, know him clearly The appearance, even if there is no portrait, the ability of the official organization of the extraordinary people is enough to restore a pair, the effect may even be more like a photo than the photo, so Jason does not need to have the motivation to destroy similar things, this It is a very understandable thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows, he has reserved induction in this most normal place! If you look for it according to the portrait, even if the night has a seal "1 - 42", it is not so easy to lock the target... Moreover, when he acts twice, he uses his own ability to cover his face, who can think of it, being tight The hidden and protected face turned out to be fake! Klein tasted a sly taste from Jason's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked his forehead and began to recall the picture he saw in "Dream Divination." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A house with a glass greenhouse, this feature is quite obvious, similar buildings in Beckland will not be too much! But the question is, how do I report it? I just said this to the heart of the machine, Jason must have been aware of the danger, and began to disguise the transfer...[br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Directly find seals The value of '1 - 42' night? What should I do if I meet an acquaintance? I don't want to be turned into ashes, spilled into the Tsock River... and I can't rush to report it. I just started to act. I can't get feedback from the news channel so quickly...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guy really carries a lot of cash and jewelry, a whole box of banknotes...the overall value may exceed 50,000 pounds..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's thoughts flew, and it took a while to calm down. I decided to wait for two days, and then, through the appropriate method, inform the person in charge of the matter of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divination came to an end, he returned to the real world, lifted the substitute and picked himself up on the toilet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, Klein, who was preparing to go out, threw a coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the revelation he got was that it is not appropriate to go out at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will it be dangerous to go out?" Klein did not hesitate to sit back in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After about twenty minutes, he heard the doorbell whisper and found that Essinger Stanton came to visit himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Stanton, are you rewarded?" Klein asked with delight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger refers to the back of the foyer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We go in and say."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein let the road go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sitting on the opposite sets of sofas, Essinger took his own deer cap and took a breath:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'Desire Apostle' has reappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The family members of the two detectives are unwilling to be protected and feel that they will not be implicated, so they stayed outside. At lunch today, they were found dead in their respective offices. One was too fearful and scared to death. One is very excited and consumes the last energy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are too stubborn, they are the tyrant's followers, but in this way, the punishers Formally intervened, it is said that the high-ranking powers of several churches and the military have cast their eyes on it, placing the "desire of apostles" in the most important position in the recent past. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want me to not reveal your identity as a believer in knowledge and wisdom?" Klein asked in vain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s easy to talk between detectives. "Essinger smiles at the dagger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No problem. Klein made a promise and said, "I have some news channels that are not easy to expose. If I later send back valuable information from there, I hope that you will help me to tell the night and keep secrets." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for why it is looking for the night, not the heart of machinery, he believes that he does not have to say too much, with the wisdom of Stanton's detective, with his toes I can think clearly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eisinger first agreed to Klein’s request, and then wondered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You told me that it is equivalent to let Jason notice in advance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope to find a good way to circumvent it... Please also help you think more about other possibilities. Your ring should be able to simulate a lot of extraordinary ability." . Klein responded calmly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. "Isengard did not say any more <br <br /> & nbsp />; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; he thought for a few seconds, took out his pipe sniffing a road:. <br <br /> & nbsp />; & nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The action of the 'Desire Apostle', let me make a guess, huh, huh, is also the problem you thought of before. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His main purpose is not revenge? "Klein understand each other's words <br <br /> & nbsp />; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Isengard body leaning forward, said solemnly:. <br <br /> & nbsp />; & nbsp; & nbsp; &nbsp; "Since Jason has passed the stage of 'cold-blooded', it shows that he must have become cold-blooded, and it is impossible to do this for the demon dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock, you see, until now, all the official extraordinary forces of Beckland have been mobilized, even the high-sequences will be more The attention has shifted to this matter. At this time, if Jason wants to deal with another, real goal, is it easier?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein Lueyisisuo, Chen Sheng replied: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "it makes sense!" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ......... ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Essinger went on to find Kaslana. After Klein threw the coin, he went out to the Craig Club as scheduled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have not disclosed their own guesses about the official extraordinary, and they are afraid of causing harm to Jason and causing him to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just entering the Craig Club, Klein met surgeon Allen in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long time no see." He smiled and said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too busy recently.” Allen responded kindly, just habitually keeping a cold expression. "And my wife is pregnant recently, I have to be a father again." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, what time?" Klein asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen thought for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recently confirmed, there should be more than a month ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
