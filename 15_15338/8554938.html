			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kapin lay on the ground, itchy and painful, can't wait to tear himself on the spot, get rid of this hellish pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he saw the red fire that had spread from the moment and heard the deafening explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that this last moment would be a long time, and he would remind himself of all the wonderful scenes when his wife and children were around. He thought he would feel relieved because I don't have to bear this inhuman torture anymore, but at that moment, there is still a great fear in his heart, and there is a strong desire for survival. The so-called memories have not yet had time to flash, and his thoughts have been The pain was full, and it immediately fell into deep darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window of the restaurant bursts and smashes, accompanied by countless bricks and gravel and a sharply fluttering tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards who just patrolled to this position were suddenly overturned. Fortunately, those who were not hit were also humming, shaking their bodies, or squatting or inverted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw the exterior of the restaurant collapsed and saw the flame seem to float in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people on the whole street and the police in charge of the surrounding area heard this loud noise at the same time, and they were puzzled and scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the restaurant, covered with black armor and wearing a black crown, Klein stood there, bathed in a red flame, enjoying the impact of the wave, not Moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black gas around him was burned a lot, and the spirit itself suffered some damage, but it was not serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the table, Parker and Kapin were hit into the corner of the wall, their heads were sunken and the whole became black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a quiet burning flame on their surface, and the rest of the male and female servants are similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area opposite the fireplace, Katie, who was unable to avoid it in time, was thrown onto the wall and then fell to the ground, and her body was blurred and mixed. The burnt marks did not have a good skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has not died yet, but she has been seriously stunned, but even so, she still coughs twitching and inhales a lot of suspended flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black whip was also hurt, there were many cracks, and it was lit a little, and the extraordinary bullets she owned were in this explosion. No one is spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katie has no strength at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heras made a timely roll to protect the key, but he still has a lot of blood and burnt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swayed and stood up, burning red red on the back, hair sleeves and legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His breathing became more and more difficult, and his body suffered more serious trauma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is enough to prove his physical strength and physical strength, or that he wears the iron black gloves, the body is strong enough, enough body Strong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is also expected by Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to assess how much damage the opponent can take, he will fully overestimate the physique of the target when making plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the eye is aiming at Klein almost intact, Heras twitches, hurriedly stretched out the left palm, pointing in that direction, low and said: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exile!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was pushed again unbearably, like a hurricane The confetti in the air was thrown out of the restaurant, and the hall outside was burned in the instant. The fire has become much smaller. Another wave of disaster is being brewed through wooden stairs, but because the main body of the explosion is "contained." "In the restaurant, the damage here is not serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding this opportunity, Heras turned around and ran away without looking back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the flame covered by the body is still burning, he did not waste a little time to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that his condition is extremely poor, there is a danger of getting out of control, and the effect of the toxin will not be how long it will reach the extreme. If they add up, he does not think that he There is also the possibility of defeating the invaders, even if the underground area entrance, there is a sequence of 7 Berris can help, the same is true! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue to continue this battle, Heras believes that he will only wait for the end of the poison or serious injury! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once he decided to escape, he did not manage Katie, who was still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who had just stabilized his body under "exile", saw this scene, immediately raised his head, opened his mouth, and made a sound that humans could not hear. Scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heras’s head was dizzy, and the footsteps immediately paused. The skin with a perfect body surface grew dense and transparent blisters, which was out of control. Early signs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he quickly slowed down and continued to run wild and escaped the lawn of the villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to kill... Kline didn’t catch up to avoid accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers that his purpose is to save people, not to clean up those fallen and extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, he is now quite expensive and has suffered a lot of damage. If he catches up, he may not be able to stop the crazy counterattack of Heras. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein snapped a finger and shot an air bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet shot into Katie’s head, ending her pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Klein turned and flew to the entrance to the underground area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berris who kept the hustle and bustle has been paying attention to the outside movement, but he did not dare to leave his job, fearing that the invaders’ accomplices took the opportunity to break into the dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, with the high-pressure steam rifle and the vision turned on, he was scared by the loud noise and became extremely tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he saw the majestic ghost of flying, raised the rifle without hesitation, and pulled the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white mist spouted from inside the barrel, and a sharp, pale gold bullet shot at the front speed at an alarming rate. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein had prepared for a long-term intuition, and before Bellis opened fire, he had already circumvented a small arc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet passed through the hall, shot through the main entrance and flew outside. At the same time, Belis rushed out of the duty room, carrying a high-pressure steam rifle, posing a threatening posture and moving quickly toward the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that the invaders who can solve the joint efforts of Heras, Katie and Parker will certainly be able to kill themselves, and the movements that are just now must be brought in. Concern, maybe there are punitives to come over and view, so the only choice is:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein made another invisible scream, letting the other person seem to be smashed by a hammer, there were countless Venus flying in front of him, and a few drops of blood flowed from the nose. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this did not prevent Belis from escaping. After shooting and blocking Klein, he was already in the hall and rolled over to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gave up chasing and fighting as soon as possible, shutting down the main valve, coming to the entrance of the underground area, and screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An air bomb shot on an invisible wall, gradually disintegrating the "confinement." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the reasons why Klein dares to make a gas explosion and dare to use biotoxin bottles. There is a "confinement" effect of Heras on the underground prison. If it is not a frontal impact, he does not have to worry about hurting the poor girls. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He broke the door lock and flew into the dungeon. He first found the cell in charge of Daisy based on the revelation from the previous divination screen, and then confirmed the other party temporarily. Not suffering too much damage, but also have the ability to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he was physically weakened and dissolved into the iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! Dangdang! Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron gates on one side quickly open one after the other, and there seems to be an invisible ghost running to unlock them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! Dangdang! Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of one side, and the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wuxi and other girls were shocked by the explosion outside. After a while, they suddenly found that the door was inexplicably open, but no one came in. Can leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not long before being tied up, some girls who haven’t been tempted to get up are brave, get up and go all the way and rush to the underground area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They passed through the hall that was slightly damaged by the explosion, leaving the villas that were burning more and more, and rushing in the direction of freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been coming to the street, and the young girls like Daisy remembered looking back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rescuing, they vaguely saw the top of the sinful house standing straight in a majestic figure wearing full black armor and wearing a black crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hula! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloak behind the figure floated silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They remembered this scene and did not trust the police to find a nearby church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein returned to the raging, smokey restaurant and found signs of Parker and Katie’s extraordinary characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He checked the items carried by the two people and confirmed that most of them had been damaged, and even the banknotes were already black and brittle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slammed up and went to the third floor of the second floor and quickly patrolled it again, trying to find the corresponding clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——He did not try to psychic, because time is a little too late, and brought to the fog, does not meet his next "curtain" needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even a small leader is required to "secret", these important people must also have corresponding "restrictions", not want to psychic can psychic, and before That operation is too cumbersome and too troublesome, not suitable for the present... Klein ended the exploration, nothing gained, but took the deputy tarot card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the dilapidated restaurant, he took out all the main cards in the tarot card and walked to the side of the Kapin body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he specially took two of them and sprinkled the remaining slaps on Kapin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing this step, he covered the two tarot cards that were specially drawn, covering the eyes of Kapyeong face up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the extraordinary characteristics of Parker and Katie have been analyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, the half-space outside the villa suddenly torn apart The illusory door is covered with complicated symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is silently open, and a handsome man in a tuxedo is coming out. He is forty years old, mature and elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has double golden eyes, just a sweep, it locks the restaurant like a fire scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a gust of wind blew, and a figure flew at high speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an old man with a black bonnet and a silvery stern, wearing a black robe embroidered with a storm symbol, the Cardinal of the Storm Church, Baker Archbishop of Rand, "Singer of the Gods" Ace Sneek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
