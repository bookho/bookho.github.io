			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the target has been found... Klein has taken his eyes and made a rough judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no portrait, the dead adventurer is burnt and black, and Elland clearly does not recognize this as one of the goals, observing the situation, After listening to a few seconds of horrifying laughter, he pointed to three or four military personnel lying not far from the house, and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take them back first, wait for other groups to arrive, and then launch an offensive.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He hesitated and looked up at the deep blue airship that was moving closer to it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erland did not say more, nor commanded Ryan and Daniz went to do it, and they rushed to the military personnel who had been frozen and stunned, and they were bruised.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬,蹬,蹬...he The closer you are, the weaker the pace, and later, the body has become stiff, and every step is extremely difficult.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been a Royal Navy sailor Long Elland experience When the machine is upright, no longer moving forward, slowly turning around, step by step back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is getting smoother and smoother, but he still can’t control his body, eyebrows and The corners of the horns are covered with a layer of hoarfrost.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking the common sense of freezing... The catastrophe is extremely cold... With the help of Elland, Klein I grasped the danger level of the area, and sighed in my heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the 'sun brooch' can't produce real heat, it is spiritually The stimulation, although it will also make the body produce a significant response, but at most, people can support three or four seconds in such a cold disaster..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eyes of the teeth, Alan, who couldn’t speak but couldn’t open his mouth, Klein’s eyes swept to Daniz.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lost his cane, Said low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fire. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire? Daniz first stunned, but soon understood the meaning of German Sparrow.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also saw the whole process of the failure of Airland to save people!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz’s right palm is not agglomerated The bright red flame was thrown away from the side of the military personnel.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball passed the distance of nearly 20 meters and landed on the ground without exploding. The sound of the sound is only quietly rising up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reddish fire column emits a sizzling sound, shrinking and fading.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, it expands as if it is dying.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wearing a black coat It jumped out and just fell to the side of the military.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bent down his back, grabbed his hands and grabbed the other’s clothing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he’s next Resist, back and force, slammed out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military personnel immediately vacated and flew out smoothly, falling 10 meters away, leaving The area with the most chills.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after doing all this, Klein slammed his finger and lit the inside of the pocket before the chill was immersed in flesh and blood. A match that was separated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red flame flowed like water, drowning him in an instant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; After all the gloom, Klein has disappeared in place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a glimpse of the fire, when the light is off, Klein uses Daniz The fireball and its own matches are constantly flashing in the extremely cold regions, and several military personnel are simply thrown out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elland has obviously eased and erected his thumbs up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very fortunate and honored, and today I made a decision to ask for your help. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, I like your euphemistic praise... and, remember to raise the reward... Klein nodded politely, half turned and looked open to the window." The house, the laughter inside heard more and more strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz snorted and sneaked up at Elland:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't you see the contribution I made?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although my fireball has become a prop for a magic show, it has actually contributed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy is arrogantly fair, I'm not at all fair!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the day, the shadow shrouded the area, and the airship came to the opposite half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evacuation of people around the house!" an officer on the airship shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Ellan and the two teams that arrived in succession cleared the nearby houses, the airship lowered the height and adjusted the muzzle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! Bang! Bang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artillery bursts and slams into the house where there is a strange laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing a sound explosion and seeing a violent flash of fire, Klein took a cane and was a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his "fire coverage" tactic, which was proposed in Tingen City but cannot be put into practice. Today, the overseas colonial army showed him The real scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deafening cannon, Elland is divided into different positions to guard against the inside or the monster breakout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house collapsed quickly, and the smoke filled the stacked bricks and blocks, and all the ice in the snow had vanished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a large lightning illuminates and squats on the airship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean brows and sees the airship completely still, and hears the steam boiler making a toothy sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark blue painted air monster is somewhat out of control, braving a small but not too small smoke, falling to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there is ammunition isolation, outer protection of the airbag... I thought that there would be a blast, and the airship would be directly blown into several pieces... Klein Turn all attention back to the collapsed house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first felt the cold, when I saw the male adventurer being burnt, he thought that he had met another witch - mastering the "Witch" potion Formula, who has dealt with the witches several times, he knows that the extraordinary person of this route can start from the sequence 7 and can control the frost and the black flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the lightning just made him deny this judgment, I believe that Latsia is indeed the "Moss ascetic society" or "element dawn", is the original Genuine women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thoughts just fell, the pile of masonry blocks was opened, and the bright red and black-black mixed figures were raised on the elbows and climbed out. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a woman, vaguely able to distinguish the original look of Latsia, which makes Elland and others suddenly find that the target has been found, but before Compared to Latvia, the current state is both terrifying and miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was covered with dark spots, and was torn apart by a shell of red and white, which squirmed like a white fascia of her own life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her head splits, her brains rush out, sticking to the surface, like the child's palms overlapping one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her blue-gray eyes lost their focal length, a pupil hides a flame, and a flash of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is it out of control, but also the feeling of being polluted... In the previous round of shelling, she has been seriously injured, and the breath has dropped to the extreme... Klein did not start, watching the military extraordinary people launch attacks in layers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"spiritual piercing", "painful whip", purifying bullets, small caliber artillery shooting... so round, only to let the ground chapped and spread out The lost controller Latsia collapsed completely and turned into a broken body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her torso fell to the ground and the heads of two male adventurers rolled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s eyes were slightly stunned and he found a yellow-brown sheepskin book in the flesh and blood of Lattia’s abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface of the book, a line of words written in Elvish:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Book of Natural Disasters." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These books, notes, how to always drill into other people's stomachs, the last time the Antignus family notes are like this... Klein spit first, then It is suspected that this book of Scourge is the item that Latsia, a pseudo-archaeologist, took from the remains of the "Poseidon". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there were military personnel who grasped the opportunity of the heads of two male adventurers to seem to be able to speak, and hurriedly asked:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you do in the 'Poseidon' ruins?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Poseidon Relics..." One of the male adventures The family replied painfully and confusedly, "We have not been to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to move his eyes and wanted to see the condition of his neck and below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The remains of the 'Sea God' on the island of West Meme." The military personnel reminded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...no..." The male adventurer wanted to shake his head but could do nothing. "We are going to the remains of the ancient elves... Laticia from inside... I found a book...she liked it...she started researching soon, she, she is crazy! She is crazy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This male adventurer Shouting out, the remnant spirit is completely broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the lost temple of "Poseidon", but the remains of the ancient elves? This is different from what I thought... Klein was about to listen carefully, and Elland had come over and politely asked him and Daniz to stay away from the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another street, Klein slowed down and thought about the whole thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why does Laticia take the book of Scourge from the remains of the ancient elves, which will cause 'Poseidon' Cavituva to be unable to maintain its existence and gradually collapse? What is the connection between the two?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elves..."Poseidon... In accordance with the small 'sun', the elf king Sonia Sorem, the ancient god, holds the current master of the storm 'The authority of 'that is, the elf has no doubt that it has the sequence 3 'Sea King', and the higher sequence 2...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you, card? This sea snake of Vitua discovered by accident that a relic remains on the bottom of the sea, directly swallowed the extraordinary characteristics left by a certain elf, and fortunately survived the two steps of temper and out of control. , gradually getting the beliefs of the indigenous people of the Rothde Islands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slowly The idea, which he had to thank "The Hanged Man" sir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original small "sun" did not reveal the corresponding authority of the eight ancient gods. Later, under the guidance of "downside down people", some of them were told. This includes the general situation of the elven king Sunia Solem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the direct ingestion of extraordinary characteristics or the improvement of the corresponding materials, it has not happened. Before the potion system has not been perfected, the human ancestors I gained extraordinary power and made similar attempts, but only a very lucky little man survived and became an extraordinary person. He did not become a monster, a madman, and he was not violent on the spot, and his flesh and blood collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
