He couldn’t react to it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not his expected answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentlemanly? The vampire thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a detective, clear accounting is a must, and you have delayed me to go to the Cragg Club. I don’t know what the limited supply for these two days is... ...Klein looked at Emlin White, half-jokingly yelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, Emlin smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must see the patient, can Formulate the right medicine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen, very confident... Klein nodded thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately thought of a question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White family seems to be an excellent potpot, I I really have to be hurt, I am poisoned, I can come to them for treatment... I have tried my best before, and the "pharmacist" formula that I got from the Utrechtsky Father is not useless. I don’t need to train another assistant who is good at treatment... The plan is not as fast as change...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it’s not a waste, already from Miss Magic The cost is recovered there, and the formula, as long as it exists, is always valuable...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the White family will definitely stay away from River Bay Avenue and hide identity again. Settling, I may not be able to find it, not so convenient...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, before the suggestion of "heart candle", go to the harvest church, you should be able to wait Emlin White...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein took off his hat and gave a gift:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No problem, I will take you there at the time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not delay your time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White's expression changed a bit, hesitating and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If You can eliminate the effects of enamel candles, you can get more rewards, and..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and raised his chin: "And the blood family Friendship. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a "magician" with a sun brooch and a biotoxin bottle. The use of the mind and body is limited to psychic. What can I do?" In the people I know, the "Justice" is closer, but she is only serial 8, just a "reader"...unless you change the letter to "fools who are not in this era", we can study How to use the knowledge recorded in the "Book of Secrets" to help you solve this problem through the corresponding rituals... Speaking of it, the vampire seems to be the admirer of the original moon, and they are very similar to the Witch King... The ancient god, the vampire ancestor Lilith, will not be the original moon? Klein thoughts smiled dimly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will help you pay attention to the corresponding method. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin. Huaihua nodded, no longer said, could not wait to turn and rushed to the door.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the coachman is still nearby, he will definitely open his black bat wings and vacate directly to the second floor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein laughs With a sigh of relief, he shook his head with emotion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the rental carriage and went to the steam subway station not far away, and he turned back 15 Minsk Street, Jowood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the door, Klein, who has developed the habit, opens the letter box to check for letters.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him was that there really was a letter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawyer Jurgen? Klein picked up the envelope in confusion and tore it open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the light of the streetlight, he saw a piece of paper and two banknotes inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The denominations of these two notes are 1 Sule and 5 Sule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total 6 Sule... During this time, I fed the cat three times... The appointment is 2 Sule every time... Klein opens the door with a sigh Entered the house and lit the gas lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfolding the letterhead, he found that there was not much content above, and the words handwritten by Jurgen were as meticulous and serious as he was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Moriarty Detective:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for the cloth during this time Rodi's care, this is the reward you deserve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have pulled the doorbell twice and found that you are not at home, so I have to put the reward in the envelope and put it in your letter box.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't, I may have to come back tomorrow evening, and I will miss the verbal appointment. My grandmother promised tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As a lawyer, I value the validity of a verbal contract and hope to perform it strictly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;" Finally, thank you again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Urgan Cooper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Lawyer, your thanks are really dry. It doesn't mean anything, it's not as good as Brody. Your explanation of the behavior is very detailed. This is really the standard Jurgen style... And, what is the letter box, if it is on the earth, before I cross, I In a few months, I don’t necessarily see the letter box downstairs... Klein smiled and folded the banknote into his pocket, then took out the letter and wrote a letter to Stuart’s detective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the opening of the greeting, he deliberately wrote:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I am in Tudor The Harvest Church near the street found Emlin White, a small church belonging to the Mother Earth Church, which is rare in Lun...Emlin White claims to be because of certain things. I chose to leave home, and then I was taken over by the bishop of the Harvest Church. I lived there and became a..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it and wrote it. The word "volunteer". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he said concisely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After my persuasion, he has returned to the river 48 Bay Avenue, however, he may often go to the Harvest Church to volunteer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After writing, Klein read it all over, then put down the pen and neatly Fold the letter paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out the envelope but did not put the corresponding stamp and planned to hire someone directly to Stuart’s home tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If you go to the Kingdom Post system, even if you put the letter into the mailbox now, you have to take it tomorrow, and then there are processes such as sorting and delivery. Therefore, although in the same time, Wang Duo Beckland, Stuart has at least hoped to see the letter after the day, only to notify the White couple, and Emlin White is now penniless, only people Even guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also to get paid early... Klein laughed softly, packed up the coffee table, and went back to the second floor to brush his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wednesday morning, spend 2 Sule, commissioning a rental coachman After sending the letter, Klein bought some of the main ingredients of Dixi paella and planned to make an egg fried rice today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the white rice, he couldn’t help but swallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After spending a certain amount of time, after various tossing of the appliance and the kitchen, he finally made a pot of fragrant egg fried rice with bacon and black tea. I ate some tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case of Emlin White, because the other party did not play according to common sense, his performance has not really started, it has ended, and failed to achieve the intended purpose, so he can only find another chance to take the initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Klein is not without gains, failure is also experience, which at least makes him understand one thing:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unlike ordinary magicians, my 'performance' not only has assistants, but also enemies, as well as participants, their reactions, their choices, will also affect the development of things, These factors must be considered in advance...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also a lesson. It is better to be taught in such a small matter than to be taught in some important matters. Ok..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the empty space in front of him and thought about what else he could do on his own initiative.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seriously considering it for a while, he found that he didn’t.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s not absolutely not, but it’s not suitable for him to do it now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the evil spirit in the ruins of the Quaternary Tudor dynasty, Klein has always wanted to solve it, but even if With Sharon of "Crimson Moon" and Maric who got the characteristics of the out-of-control "resentment", he does not feel that he can fight against monsters of high sequence level. Maybe he does not know how to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Active performance, does not mean that the main action is dead, does not mean taking life to perform... Klein warns himself in his heart.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing, he really wants to do it, just don't think there is any chance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing is looking for a surgeon Allen brings a strange child, Will. Anthony.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other tarot in the other hand, Klein has always been interested, thinking Confirm that it is a magical item.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this matter has been taken over by the "nights", and Klein is not too eager to blend the actions of the former colleagues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dr. Allen is resting, go to the Cragg Club to find out what’s going on before deciding what to do... Well the idea of ​​quickly forming <br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; To his knowledge, the doctor Alan generally relatively free Friday afternoon and Sunday, will be playing to the tennis club Cragg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just now Klein also confirmed one thing through today’s "Beckland Morning Post", that is, the "eye of wisdom" will be called up tomorrow night. The extraordinary party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to sell the "Werewolf" extraordinary characteristics or biotoxin bottles, or even find someone to make the former a magical item... The high sequence of the Rose School is sure Still near the event, definitely full of anger, can't wait to find and tear Sharon, Maric and their helpers... This time has a low-key aspect... Klein picked up the napkin, wiped his mouth and started Clean up the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally thought that he would take a break today and go to the Craig Club for a leisurely day without taking the initiative to perform. However, he remembered again. I was able to find the fog and tried to penetrate the Amon avatar, remembering the role played by The Secret Book in that crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Klein lit the fireplace in the living room and brought the Book of Secrets back to the real world, then concentrate on reading, carefully pondering, and remembering notes . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he will burn the corresponding notes on the fog afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, at noon, he suddenly heard the sound of the doorbell being rattled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden the "Book of Secrets", Klein enters the living room and goes straight to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visitor is a Stuart Detective with a thin face but a slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very reverent and very excited to see Klein, can't wait to praise:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
