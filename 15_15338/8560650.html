He nodded and said: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he turned his head to the personal maid Richardson. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare the carriage, I am going to the Church of St. Jude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein remember It is clear that the main purpose of oneself is to play the devotees of the goddess of the night, to contact the corresponding clergy, and to find the opportunity to enter the Chanis Gate. Therefore, if you are free to go to church to pray, show sincerity and be familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sir." Richardson replied respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, Klein, wearing a jacket and a top hat, boarded the rented luxury four-wheeled carriage and enjoyed the scenery along the way. Having a black tea with lemon slices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is a small bar in the compartment, which contains the distilled wine and various sources such as Jinlangqi, Dongdong Heland, prepared by the butler Walter. Red and white wines from Intis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Klein doesn’t like drinking very much. As an extraordinary person, he doesn’t like the feeling of drunkenness, which makes him think of losing control. Therefore, using the excuse of not going to church to drink alcohol, ordered the personal maid Richardson to prepare a pot of Marquis black tea in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can, I actually want a sweet iced tea, this is the taste of the South." Klein half-jokingly told Richardson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will prepare for the next time." Richardson responded immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shook his head with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, this is not decent.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I am familiar with the neighbors here, I will hold a banquet with Desi characteristics, and then prepare sweet ice tea, huh, I think they Children should like it very much. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richardson saw that he understood the meaning of the wrong employer and was busy with a little nervousness:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I will remember. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 160 Burke Lund Street to St. Seychelles Church on Pesfer Street, it takes only about 20 minutes to walk, if not for decent Already renting a horse-drawn carriage and hired a driver, Klein is more willing to go over, digest food, and keep fit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the carriage stopped at the edge of the square outside the church. Klein took the gold cane and walked down to stop and watch the dance of the white pigeons.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter the church and come to the big prayer hall, he will hat Hand over to Richardson with his cane, find a place near the aisle, bury his head, hold his hands, and start praying earnestly and quietly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richardson sat down to his side, put a variety of items, and aimed at the dark sacred emblem on the altar, and closed his eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In a calm and peaceful atmosphere, Klein felt that his spirituality had a slight divergence, which is not surprising, because the believers who pray in the church, There will be similar encounters - a small amount of spirituality with a good faith, a little bit of convergence, to provide power for the underground Chanis door seal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know How long ago, his inspiration suddenly touched, quietly opened his eyes and looked invisibly to the front.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an old man wearing a black robe of clergy, hair Sparse, the color is like a frost, and the face is pale like a dead person.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From afar, he is cold and cold, with a lack of expression, and dimly lit in the big prayer hall. The environment has some degree of blending.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal caretaker... Klein just glanced at it, made a judgment, reopened his eyes and prayed, of course, he I have remembered the other person's appearance features:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man dressed up by the clergyman also sat down and prayed to the goddess. In the entire prayer hall, there were only a few holes above the front wall, shining into pure light, like the stars, letting the darkness The environment appears soft and sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time passes by, and Klein’s inspiration is touched again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully opened his eyes and saw the inner guard in black robes leaving the seat and entering the side passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be the way to the back of the church...the internal caretakers live in the church? They have no relatives, no family, no one's own residence? From their state, this does not seem too surprising, and it is also a normal measure to guard the people inside the Chanis Gate and accept the supervision of the bishops... this means that I really have to be a bishop with the Church of St. Seychelles. The priests became friends, and they were given the opportunity to enter and leave the church freely... Klein didn't have much trouble, closed his eyes and thought about various problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he slowly got up and walked to the altar, stood in front of the dedication box, took out 50 pounds of cash, and pledged in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made the bishop and pastor who are on duty today look over, his eyes become friendly, and he remembers his appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete all this, Klein gently decapitated several clerics, turned and walked along the aisle to the exit, Richardson took his hat and cane, Followed by the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the Great Prayer Hall, he walked through the door to a beautiful mural and the light shining through the high-colored stained glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there were a few figures coming in. The first one was a middle-aged man with two long hair and soft facial features. He was wearing a black trench coat. Wearing gloves and not holding a cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left rear of the man is a young man in the same black trench coat. He is green and handsome, and his hair looks a little casual, like getting up in the morning. I haven’t done it carefully afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His appearance, his figure, Klein are all very familiar, but there is another illusion that has not been seen for more than a decade:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Mitchell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s light shrunk, the foot did not stop at all, keeping the previous steps and strides, welcoming those wearing black trench coats. "Night of the night." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Klein confirms that they are "nights!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of the encounter, he casually swept Leonard and others, then crossed them and walked to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is open, the outer layer is thin, the sun is pure, and the white pigeons are flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Mitchell also looked at the passing believers with nothing to look back, sighing and sighing:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that I can stay in Beckland for a few more days and take a break. This case is not only dangerous, but also must be tight at all times."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a group of "red gloves" that have just smashed a sacred demon event and caught two of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This surface seems to be easy, the actual is not at all simple, they have experienced a lot of setbacks and counterattacks to complete the task, each team member is not only tired, but also tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Soest shook his head and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the life of our 'red gloves' When you choose to join, you should know that it will be like this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But congratulations, this time you can be promoted to 'A Soulmaster'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Mitchell grinned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is more than I thought Slow, and, Soest captain, you finally, finally can go to the sequence 5. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the talk, this group of "red gloves" entered the dark and quiet hall, each looking for a place to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard is about to concentrate on his prayers, and suddenly he hears a little old voice in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The person just had a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Leonard buried his head and asked with a voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly old voice replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The few people you met at the door One, I live in your body, and the strength has not recovered, I can't see it too clearly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard recalled, whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has an ancient atmosphere." Leonard's mind The voice inside is simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A great person who has lived for a long time?" Leonard muttered. "I will try to check it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he thought in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man must have concealed some situations, he rarely reminded him so actively I have a problem, but I am ambiguous... If I find the target and confirm that there is no harm for the time being, I will leave it alone, so as not to be involved in the battle of the undead monsters of the Quaternary... If that is true To bring disaster, report directly to the Archbishop...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joewood District , inside a house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the money you borrowed before." Fols handed over 220 pounds to Hugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has received £100 from Mr. Moon and £500 from Ms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh Dilcha grabbed his own messy blond hair, looked at the money, looked up and looked at Foers, and asked: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you really involved in illegal gambling?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must tell you that this kind of gambling is definitely It's a trap and a trap, so you can win only to make you lose more! Although you are a master of tricks and have the opportunity to deceive them, similar gambling is likely to hide other extraordinary people! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop, stop, stop! "Fuls pressed his hands and said with a good air, "I look like the kind of person who will participate in illegal gambling?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like! Hugh replied without hesitation, "If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't even smoke, you still want to smoke marijuana!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is because the pain caused by the full moon slang has made me seek paralysis, and now it will not be like this... Fols did not argue with the rest, directly explained: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I sold my occult knowledge in a meeting of extraordinary people, huh, that is very generous, bidding for a few hundred pounds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way..." Hugh’s moment left the question just now and said, “There has recently been a new extraordinary gathering in the Eastern District. I was invited. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A new extraordinary party? "Folse is a glimpse, and there is some expectation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to some words from her teacher Dorian Gray and "The Fool", she knows Louis Wei. En is the god of the Aurora, this time Beckland, it is likely to replace the missing Mr. A, to rebuild the Aurora in this metropolis, so he has the possibility to disguise and make a new The extraordinary people gathered out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fol thought for a moment, seemingly and unintentionally against the rest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Do you want to participate? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
