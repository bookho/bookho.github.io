			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After brushing, the night of the winter glowed with a tree-like silver-white lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn’t fall, but it’s just through the air, and the area around Klein’s standing position was as white as it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singer of the Gods" Ace Snake regained his gaze and whispered his face:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rose School?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not "Resentment", not a real undead..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mature middle-aged man with a pair of golden eyes looks at the body of Kapyeong and looks at it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With tarot cards The body of the target...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the second similar case in the last two months."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" When was the first time?" Cardinal Sneek asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mature middle-aged man in a tunic dress coughs a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The Creator's attempted to use a fraudster to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not the Rose School." Cardinal Sneek made a positive judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organizations that believe in evil spirits, although no one wants to see anyone, but will not deliberately destroy similar things, but there is a kind of happiness, waiting The other party first confuses the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think so, maybe it’s a new hidden organization. Their characteristic is to fill the target with tarot cards." Mature and handsome The middle-aged man smiled and said, "And the different representations of the tarot cards seem to express different meanings... The face of this corpse is only covered with two cards, one 'judgment' and one 'emperor', ' The trial is the motivation and purpose, and the 'emperor' is the organizational code of the previous one? Of course, this may also be a ritual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sneck The cardinal did not answer and looked around: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's see what happened here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, the first batch of punitives arrived at the villa of Kapyeong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fog, only three times "paper man substitute" Klein, who has not reached the limit, is using divination to confirm the subsequent security of Daisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wuxi can go home smoothly." He held the pendulum in his left hand and closed his eyes and meditated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven times, Klein blinked and saw the citrine pendant turning counterclockwise, but the amplitude was very small and the speed was very slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that there are still a few twists and turns in the journey back to Daisy, but it is almost negligible... Klein interprets the revelation and puts down the last worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then looked at the two items placed in front of them, all of which exude a strong spiritual brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them is a light blue translucent hexagonal prism with a ray of light inside, as if it came from a deep lightning of consciousness, this is The extraordinary character left by Ms. Katie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other one is Parker who didn’t work in the previous battle. His extraordinary characteristics condensed into a ball, like a child's fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "fist" consists of three colors, iron black and dark red wrapped around a large piece of silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not hesitate to immediately produce a pen and paper, ready to use the two groups of extraordinary characteristics of divination corresponding to the potion formula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he was promoted to Sequence 7, because there are too many extra effects of the legacy features, there is almost no way to use this divination formula, even if there is such a mysterious space to exclude Interference has improved his divination ability to a certain extent, and it does not work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he became a "magician", he was above the fog, and initially had the ability to divination with the extraordinary characteristics of the legacy, but the probability would not succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, without exception, Klein failed shamefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also has some gains, that is to figure out the sequence names corresponding to the two groups of extraordinary characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Parker is the Sequence 8 'Sheriff', Katie is the Sequence 7 'Interrogator'... Isn't this the 'arbitrator' approach? In the hands of the royal family, the military, and the relatively small number of aristocratic families in Lun, their regulation of exhaling formulas and extraordinary materials is very strict... Is it true that some of the girls kidnapped by Kapin will be sent to? Aristocratic manor?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But they don't want to enjoy it, send four extraordinary people to help Kapyeong, which is obviously not equal...Hrasbike It’s a lot of tricks. Maybe it’s the sequence of this route. After wearing the glove, it might even reach the sequence of 5... Does it involve some bloody and evil sacrifices, and the target of the request cannot be exposed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to the kingdom, the Castilla family of Fenetport also mastered this extraordinary path and passed it on to their military and intelligence systems... ...and is it a spy case that doesn't know what is involved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein tried to divinate his own guesses and again failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He temporarily foresomed the matter and turned to tap the edge of the bronze long table, silently saying:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as there is a formula, there are corresponding auxiliary materials, these two extraordinary characteristics can make people become the 'Secret of the Sheriff' of Sequence 8 and the 'Interrogator' of Sequence 7... Miss 'Magician' The friend named Hugh seems to lack the extraordinary material of the 'Sheriff'....<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next time you can sell Parker to the 'world' Miss Magician, as soon as possible, accumulate the material cost of my follow-up 'no face' sequence... always through the 'world', it seems not too suitable, this time I deliberately left the tarot card, Miss Justice If I heard about this, I would definitely think it was what my deaf person did... it was sold by Mr. Fool's for him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein quickly finalized the plan and let the extraordinary characteristics of the "Sheriff" and "Interrogator" fly into the corner and hide in the debris pile.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what the sequence 6 and sequence 5 of the 'arbitrator' route are called...the feeling of using order and the law...the 'judge'? Klein retracted his thoughts, closed his eyes halfway, and carefully examined his own state.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again became spiritually active, the potion was shaken, digested In the sense of speeding up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he intuitively believes that he has summed up most of the "Magician Code", and the rest of the details are better. No, it doesn't matter, it doesn't affect the progress of digestion too much.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a round pen and parchment, Klein has enhanced memory to write<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician Code:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1. Don't make unprepared performances;<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2. The challenge is impossible, even if the final result is only false;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein believes that the above is "the magician The two cores of the Code are the key to grasping them, and the rest are supplements and improvements to them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"3. Active performance;<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"4. Try to get the audience's applause;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"5. Control the attention of the target. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the dark red round belly pen, Klein browsed from start to finish Once again, self-judgment: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, from January 1, 1350, there are still two months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, Klein smashed his forehead and prepared to return to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After putting the "Black Emperor" card, biotoxin bottle and other items, he suddenly laughed and laughed at himself:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The challenge is impossible... Doesn't this mean death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice reappears, Klein's figure disappears into the gray Above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cheap hotel in the Beckland Bridge area, he slammed his eyes and saw the candlelight that he summoned his ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast handling of the hand, Klein put on a thicker worker's jacket just bought 4 Suller and walked to the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the sweet iced tea that he had bought before, and looked at his own blurred figure reflected on the window, revealing a sincere smile and whispering to himself: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, his cup in his hand touched the glass, Then raise your chin and drink it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he left the hotel leisurely, the nearby gas street lights were all bright, and the pedestrians and carriages were busy, at the junction of Jowood and West End. The explosion was unaware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein strolled around the "Brave" bar for a while, and at 7:58, he rang the "eye of wisdom" old gentleman's extraordinary party The door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put on an iron mask and put on a robes with a hood, which is usually average and ordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, every night, I will go to different places to check some contacts. The sign of Hugh saw a sign that had never appeared before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It belongs to the party convened by Mr. A, pretending to be the hand of others, selling the "Sheriff of the Sheriff" formula to her golden mask male. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a sign of an emergency meeting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t been looking for me before, I pretended not to have this, how suddenly..." I thought about it and decided to take a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The golden mask man promised to give her some tasks, let her save enough money, and redeem the corresponding extraordinary materials to him<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Hume changed places and marked the time and place of the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, in a remote but well-connected alley, I secretly observed for a while and walked out of hiding, heading for the golden mask. Man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is still wearing a black tuxedo, and the light brown eyelids sweep over the head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There is a task for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Difficulties and rewards?" asked in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man pushed the gold-cast mask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing dangerous, but also There may be a lot of danger, depending on how you do it yourself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The initial reward is 30 pounds. If you can get useful information, I can even directly Give you a special material for the 'Security Officer'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What mission? "Hugh and frowning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man with a golden mask has a gaze:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Through your channel, find out who has inquired about Ka Ping recently. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
