			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160 Burklend Street, in a light-filled study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bookshelves are arranged in rows, and there are many collections. It looks like you are in a private library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is sitting on a high back chair, looking at today’s newspaper and discovering whether it’s the Tasok newspaper or the Beckland Daily "There are more advertisements in the conspicuous position - the transfer of 10% of the Beckland bicycle company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Stanton is still very good at doing things, and it’s only a few days to complete the financial investigation and value assessment... Kline just secretly sighed, inspired Touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly opened his mind and saw the messenger Miss Renee. Nicole came out of the void, still holding the four blonde red eyes The head, one of them has a letter biting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be a reply from Miss Sharon... Klein thought as he reached out and took it lightly:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he subconsciously looked into the door of the study, because the outside was guarded by the personal maid Richard Desen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the envelope and spread the paper. Klein took a quick look and confirmed that the owner of the letter was Miss Sharon. She said that she did not purchase the “biotoxin bottle”. The idea, wait a while, if this magical item is still there, maybe consider it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a financial situation? Or do you spend more money doing more important things? Klein thought about it for a moment, and intuitively thought it was the latter possibility, because the half god, called Zatvin, could not stay in Beckland anymore, and Sharon and Maric were initially rid of the Rose School’s pursuit. Their extraordinary strength and sequence characteristics, the environment is loose, the money is still relatively simple, and they seem to control the "brave bar" black market arms trade, acting as a supporter behind Ian, this is only this You can earn a lot from the line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Klein raised his head and saw the messenger's four pairs of eight red eyes staring at themselves without turning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked, thinking that the other party was urging debts and clearing his throat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “No need to reply.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The first amount will be paid this week. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenitt 缇 Nicole's four heads are in turn:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No..." "Anxious..." "No..." "Interest..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss messenger is still very good... Klein laments, Renee 缇 Nicole’s figure disappeared into the original place and returned to the depths of the spiritual world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burning the letter paper, rested for two quarters of an hour, he Going to the door, telling Richardson to prepare the carriage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intends to go to the church before the afternoon philosophy class.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, Klein, who only drank a few black teas, quickly came to the square outside the Church of St. Seychelles.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appreciated for a while After the peace of the pigeons, he walked over the church door, entered the prayer hall, and found a place to sit down. Richardson, like the last time, sat down with his employer's hat and cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the prayer of emptying, Klein’s inspiration was touched again, and the instinct opened his eyes and looked to the left.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately saw the green hair of Renner De Mitchell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Night" is not wearing a windbreaker, a white shirt without a belt and a straight trousers and a black vest, the style is very It’s casual.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged gentleman who saw the horny cream looked over. He smiled and bowed his head, closed his eyes, and pretended to pray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentleman who is very good and temperament enters here, and it will inevitably be noticed to a certain extent. Leonard Mitchell himself is often watched by others, and he has a deep understanding of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in his mind, the slightly old cockroach sounded up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s him.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, I haven’t lived up to my efforts to go to church yesterday and today... Leonard slightly thought, but the surface did not move Sensual color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is also pretending to pray and thinking about the doubts in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leonard When is this guy so devout?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although he is definitely more pious than me, it is definitely not the kind of church that goes into the church every day, week or even two weeks. Then once...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He has a purpose? He just seems to be looking at me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein suddenly realized: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old grandfather in his body is the angel of the Zoroastrian family, that is, 'theft The Angel of the Pathway...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The God of the Gods' Amon is the king of angels in this way, he can find fog, even want to invade ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, the grandfather in Leonard is likely to have noticed the fog power or traces on me!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this After the judgment, Klein heart suddenly raised up, it seems to have been around full of dangerous traps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept the prayer movement unchanged, and the scorpion under the eyes did not turn, the whole person was calm and restrained, and the atmosphere inside the church was completely consistent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, he slowly got up and walked to the altar, and before the dedication box, he put a total of 50 pounds into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as before, he smiled at the bishop and pastor responsible today and got a very friendly response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way to St. Seychelles Church, Klein took the hat from Richardson and fed the pigeons for ten minutes at the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind him, there are successive prayers coming out, including Leonard Mitchell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not look at the main entrance position, took a leisurely shot, took a gold cane, and walked to the four-wheeled carriage that was parked nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard also fed the pigeons at the square and watched the target board the carriage, but there was no tracking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the other party has an old-fashioned atmosphere and has received the attention of the inhabitants of the body, he certainly does not dare to neglect the general idea and dare not take direct action, which would be very dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is ready to check the periphery and collect the necessary information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When is the time to see what the old man said...and now it’s not the direction of the investigation, the kind of high-end carriages, the entire Beckland, the number is quite limited, no matter My own family, or rented, is easy to determine the source, then I can know the identity and origin of the gentleman... Leonard looked at the white pigeon and thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a "nighter" with rich experience, and is the elite "red glove" in the "Night of the Night"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a white pigeon flew over his wings and seemed to have a note in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard frowned and extended his left palm, watching the white pigeon lower its height, threw the note down, then flapped its wings and flew again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raise the hand to hold the note, and Leonard fired it with vigilance and doubt, and saw only two words on it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Parasitic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...Leonard’s pupil hobo shrinks, only the whole body’s hair is set up, and the mood tends to explode in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman saw my secret? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an old-fashioned person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may be one of the undead monsters left by the Quaternary! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is warning me? Let me not intervene in his affairs, not even close to him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, think back to the middle-aged gentleman who has a white, blue, and deep squat, Leonard Mitchell only feels that the other side has a move With a strong sense of deterrence, people dare not look straight and dare not approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly lost the idea of ​​investigating the other side, watching the pigeons fall at the same time, pressing down the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Old man, that person may be your old friend.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to investigate anything, wait until your strength recovers." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old friend..." The slightly old voice repeats these two words and seems to have some doubts, but is not sure what to do.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard quickly converges on emotions and chuckles: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is the Zoroastrian family..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, less than a hundred meters away, the intersection of Pesfer Street and other streets.< Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn with a little silver silk. Dontes leaned back against the wall and slowly closed his eyes, hiding the line of facial features In the shadow of the car.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His avatar Richardson is on the side, a middle-aged man wearing a dark red coat wearing an old triangular hat appears unreal, A gift to the owner, then disappeared, no one was alarmed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage slowly turned, the square position, a group of white pigeons flew up.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... .........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got home, I entered the room with a large balcony, and Klein, who was silent along the way, sighed silently.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Leonard does not accept the warning under the temptation of the old grandfather, he will write another piece of paper in the past, saying: "I know that 'the gods' Amon is Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implication is that, when it comes to disrupting my affairs, I will tell the "God of God" Amon, there is a Zoroastrian family here. Angel.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not make the grandfather feel good. Dontes is weak and must rely on others to fight him, closer to a warning not exceeding Three courtesy and respect for an angel.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the two warnings do not converge, then the method is not just to inform the "God" Amon .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, there is a high probability that they can shock them. The grandfather’s choice of shallow parasites must have other plots or difficulties, and should not I am willing to be knocked off by the table... Oh, this thing has to thank the "mirror" Arrods, if you don't know in advance that Leonard has a "stealer" angel, I definitely can't find that I have been stared. Not to mention warning them with appropriate wording and methods... Klein thought calmly and calmly, without the tension and confusion before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He relaxes, the door is knocked, and the personal maid Richardson says:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "Mr., the butler is looking for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please ask him to come in." Klein turned away from the large balcony and returned to the semi-open room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter with white gloves opens the door:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
