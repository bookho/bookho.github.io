			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unlit sewer, Klein rubbed his neck and turned his attention back to the ruptured head of Lalhus and the headless body. I returned two tarot cards inserted in each other's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally wanted to take back all the "flying knives" thrown out, erase the corresponding clues, but found a very serious and very serious problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, he has no dark vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was able to rush in the dark sewers and fight fiercely with Lalousus, relying on the vision! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see the color of the gas field of Lalus, can see the spiritual radiance of various creatures, and vaguely grasp the place where they "illuminate", borrow This distinguishes the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the tarot card he is using is not the one that originated from the night squad, no spiritual silver, ordinary, and No features. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an environment, Klein can use its own gas field color and spiritual brilliance to distinguish the contours of things in a small range, but there is no way to separate it. In the case of distance, I saw the cards that were scattered on the wall and scattered everywhere - just now he and Lalhous all along the way, not confined to somewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he believes that as long as you give yourself plenty of time, it’s not too difficult to find the tarot cards you’ve thrown out. The hunt for the night-timers of Llanus and the military personnel on the airship, may arrive in the next minute! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can’t be careless in this regard... I have been wearing gloves... This tarot card was bought before Beckland, and it belongs to the national unified... ...I have never used it in general... Even if I carry it with me, most of the time I put it with Mr. Azick’s copper whistle... No matter what method, it’s very difficult to locate me through them. Restore some of the battle scenes, and there are masks on my face, shoes are high... Various ideas flash instantly, and Klein quickly decided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to Llanus’s headless body, squatted down, and found the right palm with black gloves, quickly looking for the remaining items on the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Klein did not have the idea of ​​a psychic ritual. First, the feeling of the evil spirits before him, impressed him, dare not blindly pass through Llanus The spirit, unless brought to the fog, the second is that the night and military personnel may arrive at any time, he does not feel that there is enough time to arrange the ceremony, call yourself, respond to yourself, and then to the fog Passing above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The give up will give up... Klein silently said a word, and took his hand back from Llanus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This crazy scammer seems to be in a hurry, without cash, without materials, without a spell, only with an eye-sized badge. There is a light and thin spiritual radiance on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not afraid that this item can be positioned, because he intends to wait until he falls onto the fog and slowly study it, so he stands up straight and side Put the badge in the pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the body of Llanus, not waiting for the extraordinary characteristics to be precipitated, using the left palm with black gloves to take the remaining tarot cards Come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he straightened his left arm and placed his palm directly above the body of Llanus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, Klein let go of the palm of his hand, letting the piece of Tarot cards fall, and the leaves covered the headless On the body, they have faces that face up, painted with pictures and numbers, and some with dark red back and looming patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, Klein took out the Azick copper whistle and threw it a few times before he ran to the depths of the sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two minutes, the figure finally found this place, some of them were wearing black thick trench coats, while others were designed with a tailored shape. Military uniforms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is Cresté Sesimma with a pure white bone sword. His red gloves are stained with dust, and his persevering face reveals obvious exhaustion. And weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two tarot cards on the head, one is "Emperor" and the other is "The Wheel of Fortune." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headless body surface is covered with more cards, each depicting the "victor-driven chariot", "dragging in a robe, carrying The hermit of the lamp, "the white horse, the death of the armor", and more the holy cup digital card, the scepter digital card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding walls and the ground, the same or inserted or lying "Devil", "Sun", "Judgement" and other tarot cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this looks like the scene of a strange ceremony, Llanus belongs to the sacrifice that is destined to be sacrificed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creste. Sesima breathed a sigh of relief, his brows wrinkled, and the extraordinary people around him were both in the dark. The horror and mysterious picture made it impossible to return to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the death scene of Llanus, Klein quickly found An exit left, tearing off the clown mask, in the shadow of the gas streetlight, headed for the Eastern District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that, he has dealt with the smudges of the soles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the Eastern District and arriving at Black Palm Street, he was relieved a little, and then quickly held himself to summon himself in a rented one-bedroom house. Respond to your own ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of Klein will wear the full set of clothing tonight, the remaining spells, herbs, essential oils, along with the badges that Llanus got. On the fog, the corresponding clues were burned with a spiritual flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... He vomited and finally had a free look at what the badge from Llanus looked like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This badge is only the size of the eye, the front is engraved with the symbol of fate and concealment, behind it is a circle of compact and small ancient Hermes inscription:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With this item, you can join."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean? Is Lalusus a member of a hidden organization? Klein smashed his forehead. When his body and mind were exhausted and the timing was not appropriate, he gave up the research decisively and planned to wait for the Tarot party to ponder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly left the mysterious space above the fog and replaced it with another set of clothing, removing the camouflage that he had done before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he is not in a hurry to return to Minsk Street, intends to sleep until the next morning, because it is easy to act on the street after the early hours of the morning. To investigate, and just happened again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lying on the bed, Klein looked out at the moonlight in the moonlight, and the mind gradually calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing the initial revenge, he felt that he had removed a lot of burdens and lost a lot of repression. Compared with the previous period, the mental state was obviously better. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ins. Zangweier and the seal '0-08' are not the current ones I can cope with, and the gap is very large, only become high The strong sequence, become a semi-god and a half-human existence, is qualified to blend this thing... Before the promotion sequence 4, I will pretend they don't exist..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, my goal for a long time to come is to work hard to improve myself. I have now completely digested the 'Clown' potion, and when the extraordinary materials are gathered, I can be promoted to 'Magician'." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are also 'no face people', 'secret master', and I don't know the corresponding sequence of names."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides, be a normal detective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s mood is calm, thoughts divergently thinking about the future The arrangement for a period of time is no longer so impetuous and no longer so depressing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, his mouth is slightly upturned and silently says:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky was just around the corner, and a group of people wearing surgical caps and white masks dressed as doctors came to the dock of the Dockers’ Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man who has experienced it at first glance said to the confusing guest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You have found a contagious disease in this house. There is already a person named Kevin who has passed away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will provide free treatment. This There are specific drugs for infectious diseases. As long as you take them in time, there will be no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kevin?" One of the guests was shocked and looked around. I was looking for a colleague named Kevin, but I didn't find anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the pseudonym of Llanus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this charity medical organization accompanied by a police officer, the residents no longer doubt, began to queue up for drugs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is a middle-aged man with a big beard. He is very nervous and asks Dong to ask him, afraid that a bottle of medicine can’t fight the kind of strong infectious disease. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the doctors showed impatience, he just drank the bottle of blue color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he was taken to the side, aiming his mouth at a hole of the same size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vo! vomit! vomit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man suddenly nausea, violent vomiting, spit out a group of sour and bloody things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was trying to look at what he spit out with half of his body moving his eyes, but he was forcibly opened by two powerful nurses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth-sized hole is in an iron-black metal bucket with a dark, dark bottom and almost no light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there, there is a pool of yellow-green liquid lying in the middle, the center of the liquid is a small piece of blood-colored meat, the meat is covered with fine Black hair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vo! vomit! vomit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One guest took the potion and vomited in front of different metal barrels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens, a luxury villa in the Earl of Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you suddenly come to visit so early?" Audrey looked out at the sky outside and looked at the priest of Gretel in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glelint looked around and found only a golden retriever dog lying next to him, so he lowered his voice:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was planning to go to the racecourse. I met Const on the road. He told me something very interesting. It was really interesting. I thought it would happen to pass by here. Come and share. For you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Audrey asked with great interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glylint did not pay attention to the words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should have heard of Aurora will? It is the aurora that killed the Intis ambassador, they were caught, and several important members died. A very large plot failed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it was a matter of "real creator" divinity. Hugh, they found someone to inform up in the evening yesterday, and they just acted at night...etc. Aurora would admire as "real creator"! Audrey’s eyes lit up and asked with enthusiasm: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What plot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I don't know, Const refused to say, he only told me that the person responsible for this plot was a former alleged fraudster, a swindler named Lalus." Glylint spread his right palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
