			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a second of confirmation, Klein clasped his hands and leaned forward:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the specific thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, can't say it anymore." Emlin White shook his head resolutely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worried that Kline, who was tempted, did not ask again, simply based on the information the vampire just revealed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;About the "fool"...can help Emlin White solve the hidden dangers...there is a high risk... Combined with his previous thoughts, this seems to have indicated that he intends to hold the corresponding ceremony to the "fool" "I am praying to eliminate psychological cues and gain long-lost freedom... but this is no longer Emlin's own ritual, from the command of a great man, and with the pride of this vampire, willing to honor the big man." Most of them are the strong ones who are the same as the blood family... What is the reason for the descendants of the blood family to pray to the "fool"? They will cooperate with Aurora? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full of doubts, Klein raised his head and looked at Emlin, who looked forward to it, and snorted in his heart:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you guess I will respond to your petition? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took two seconds and did not make a direct suggestion. Instead, he said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to statistics Pray for the hidden existence of the situation. Thirty of the 100 cases will not receive any response, and 68 cases will encounter all kinds of terrible things, thus ruining their own lives, or living better than dead, only two It's possible to succeed and get what you want, but the price paid for it is not necessarily what they want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a former keyboard powerhouse, Klein always thinks When proving one thing or strengthening a certain point of view, only one case, a special case, not the whole sample and statistical data, all of them are hooligans, they are stealing concepts, and in general, they are accompanied by Similar words, for example, I have a friend, a girl I know, who is around me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in order to convince Emlin White, he compiled some data with his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is not entirely unfounded, at least many of the files that Klein saw in the Night Squad have a similar situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only two cases were successful? Sixty-eight cases had problems?" Emlin was really scared and couldn't help but raise his hand and manage his hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Basically, this is the danger of the thing you are going to do. If you are malicious, the risk is even higher than this." Ryan sincerely responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin subconsciously shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, no malice, and, and that The big man will protect me in the process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No malicious? Even if you are malicious, you may not know that you are just a cannon that has been pushed to the front desk... Klein raised his right palm and used gestures to strengthen his tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This will make the risk much lower, but it will never be. Can the big man really fight against the hidden existence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes, no. Emlin groaned and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So." Klein spread his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Emlin, in fact, you don’t have to take this Risk, even if you completely believe in the Mother Earth, it will not affect your life. You see that the people of Fenetport are not eating what to eat, what to wear, what to wear, what to do, etc. At that time, Father Uttraski will not force you to go to the Harvest Church to volunteer, and you will get the original freedom.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that you have adapted to the teachings of Mother Earth and there is no contradiction. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you like to be a believer and become a believer, and being forced into a believer through psychological suggestion is completely different. Even one day, I will definitely abandon the moon and believe in the mother god. I also hope that I can make the choice freely. It has nothing to do with others. This is the last pride of a bloody family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at Emlin a little surprised and didn’t expect the other party to have this. Perseverance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He considered for two seconds, did not persuade, "hmm" one channel:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is actually very simple. That is the command of the big man and the temptation to get rid of the hidden danger. Can you give courage to face a certain degree of danger? If you have the belief to give life to this, the answer is very simple.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, this matter will ultimately be weighed by yourself. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin listened heavily to the instinctive rebuttal:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I Really choose to try, certainly not for yourself, but for the entire blood family! Solving hidden dangers is just a side benefit! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the whole blood family? What can I do about the entire blood race? The big man is lying to you? Klein laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A weak vampire, have the opportunity to save the entire community, do you believe it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood, blood! Emlin stressed, "And, my strength is not bad, it is equivalent to your human sequence 7, right, still good at fighting! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the question of believing or not, you will not understand." He stood up. "Although your analysis and suggestions have no real meaning, I still have to thank you for the amount. The consultation fee was deducted from the last suitcase and tin box." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? Klein couldn’t respond to what the other party was saying.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and waited for Em Lin left, he suddenly stunned: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Under normal circumstances, containers in large amounts of transactions are not all gifts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This little discouraged vampire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths where the lightning frequency has not recovered, Silver City’s exploration team arrived on the outskirts of the semi-abandoned temple “on time”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick remembers that all the animal skin lanterns were extinguished here during the first action, and the whole team fell into pure darkness, and they listened To the little boy Jack from the depths of the temple, a creepy "helpful voice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the speculations of Mr. "Down Man" and "Meaning", this may be the starting point for us to start the cycle, but why is it outside the city when we wake up? Campfire camp, not directly here? While recognizing the discussion at the Tarot meeting, Dairik raised his arm and prayed for it according to the corresponding suggestions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His body suddenly burst into a purely clear light, stimulating Joshua and other exploration team members to quickly pose a fighting stance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" "The Demon Hunter" Colin pulled out the straight sword and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek "stunned" to look left and right:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chief lord, me I just heard a child shouting 'Help me...help me...'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to try this is a key point! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now?" Colin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now is gone." Dairik listened carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Demon Hunter" Colin swept to Joshua and others with the corner of his eye: "Do you hear it?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin only thought for a few seconds and decided to take a dark blue metal vial from the dark compartment of the waist belt and apply the viscous liquid without color to his straight sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he stabbed the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bright yellow sky, and a silvery snake-like light swam over the top and quickly spread around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brilliance of silver and white shrouded all the exploration team members, seeming to shine through the darkest "corner" of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zezzi, the silver snake snake into the void, I do not know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything calmed down, only the dim light of the animal skin lanterns quietly swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin half closed his eyes, I don’t know what to sense, after a full five seconds, I raised my finger to the front:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, there can be no negligence, mentioning the alert to the highest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good familiar words...this is not the key to breaking the dilemma ... Dairik sinks his heart and does not slack off the team and enters the semi-disused temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he learned the lesson, did not go to see the face of the "fallen creator", and then in the process of checking the above-ground part, relying on initiative and active, strive for Go to the area where the mural is located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carried the animal skin lantern, holding the "Hurricane Axe", and a teammate launched the action in the form of a group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a one-sided or mottled or collapsed wall, he finally arrived at his destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the light of the animal skin lanterns is far and near, the mural on the wall gradually becomes clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric first looked into the corner and found the strange word that was impressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Redemption Rose..." He meditated on the name, raised the animal skin lantern, and carefully examined the details of the mural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mottled wall, the highest point is blurred, a huge dark cross with a shadow that is difficult to see the specific shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, there is a desert of ridiculous silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the plains, walking a long line, their goal is the mountains in the distance, and the cross and the people hanging upside down on the top of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this team, some members are still kneeling on the ground, praying piously, while others have stood up and greeted the wind and walked forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their face is simply outlined, it seems to highlight the tattered clothing, only the leader in the forefront is quite clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a tall, silver-haired man with a vest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man's facial features are soft, his head is drooping, his eyes are closed, and there are layers of light wings behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel! Angels in the rumor! Dairik excitedly observed the situation around the "leader". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he found the man at the foot of the suspected angel, with a sly, sparkling river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river keeps turning, rounds back, injects itself, becomes the source! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circular! This forms a loop! Dairikton felt that he had caught a certain key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a cycle of experience, there is a circular river in the mural on the wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter is clearly showing or revealing something! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick’s line of sight moves, only to see the silver-haired angel whose wings are difficult to count, the face is gentle and a little indifferent, just like looking down the river and overlooking the fate . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
