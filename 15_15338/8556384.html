			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All around it is like a phantom, with rich colors, overlapping and overlapping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has just returned, observing and experiencing this wonderful walk, and feels that Mr. Azke’s hand grabbing his arm is slightly shaking . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not had time to react, he has a strong sense of weightlessness, the body can not stop falling, and even rotate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding red, yellow, white, black and other colors quickly faded, Klein fell heavily on the solid ground, falling into a dizzy head, internal organs rolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sight of Venus, everything he saw has returned to normal, and the left side is the dark valley that does not see the bottom, it is like It is the legendary demon abyss, and the right side is the gray stone wall that has been spreading upwards, which seems to support the entire area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sun, no clouds, no fog, a little light comes from the glowing moss that grows in different places, darkness and deepness are the masters of this "world" tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein left hand and supported, agilely leaping, and found that the foot is a regular road paved with slate, it can be used for two carriages in parallel, not natural formation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the road spirals down, deep into the dark cracks, one end leads to the heights, and sometimes you can see the corridors and halls with domes inside the rock walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein lifted his head, but could not see the highest point, and the line of sight was completely obscured by the gray stone wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he had a kind of enlightenment that he and Mr. Azick "falled" into the ground and were in the wreckage of an ancient civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it another area, or is it still near Beckland? When Klein’s mind was just moving, he heard Mr. Azick’s voice say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You leave here first, go up.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? Klein had not yet grasped the meaning of this sentence, and he saw the side flashes flashing, and instantly outlined an illusory open door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door seems to be made of bronze, not real enough, but it is very heavy, with numerous singular patterns and unintentional symbols on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, screaming, the door cracked open the gap, screaming out of a pale, bloody arm, in addition to the long The black-and-white vine with the baby's face and the slippery tentacles that protrude from the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very similar to the magical item of Miss Sharon... Thinking about the flashing room, Klein found that the arms, vines and tentacles are no longer crazy, quiet down Close to the ground, and they have been crazy about the performance of a sequence of 6 "live corpse" after getting started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the gap between the imaginary door was wide open, and a figure came out from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure is dressed in pure black priest robes, and the five senses are as classical sculptures, profoundly distinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a dark gold color, a dark blue scorpion, a tall nose, and a soft hat that the old man likes. The horns are not quite compatible with the middle-aged appearance. White. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the other party who completely lost their brilliance, Klein’s heart came out with the name of the person coming:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ins. Zangweier! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-handed director Tingen incident, hit the former archbishop of the night squad, the leader of the seal "0-08"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, Klein turned his body and followed Mr. Azick’s words and fled to the top of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very clear that the self of the sequence 6 stays in the semi-god confrontation, only dragging his legs, will only distract Mr. Azick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, because there is nothing in the ground to ignite, Klein can only bite his teeth and run with all his strength, and his ears are quiet and gentle: Azke’s calm and gentle voice:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Always escaped here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry about me, I remember a lot of things, knowing that I have stayed in a sequence For a long time, the sequence was called 'not dead'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬,蹬,蹬, Klein bypassed the cliff and entered a dark corridor with a dome, and the walls on both sides were engraved with mottled murals. At this point, he heard a pretentious dumb voice echoing in his previous position:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This place is forbidden! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ins. Zangweier’s side, a figure does not know when to arrive, floating in the air in violation of physical laws, wearing a gold cast on his face Gorgeous mask.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Inns Zangweier did not launch the attack for the first time, but looked at the corner where Klein disappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Night Goddess Church Sequence 4 "The Night Watchman" can give others a degree of misfortune, but just silently "blessed" Klein's Insz. However, he found that the other party did not suffer from slipping and falling into the deep valley.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, Ins. Zangweier seems to have an illusion in front of him. I saw a little illusory gray fog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without time to think, he took his eyes back and re-invested in Azick Aegis.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, hey... Klein in the high-speed running suddenly brakes, his spiritual instinct tells him that there are people in front, there are The mortal, and the high probability is the guards here!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly thinking, he stretched out his left hand and wiped his face, at the same time, his body The whole person burst into a burst of seven or eight centimeters.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the left palm leaves the face, he has become a middle-aged man, hair color Dark gold, a one-eyed middle-aged man with a high nose, Ings Zangweier!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminiscing the other person’s attitude, using illusion to modify the clothes, gram Ryan walked quickly, bypassing the corner and entering a hall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four guards wearing dark black full body armor, all eyes are sharp.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein calmed his face, walked over, deliberately dumbfounded, and said seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone sneaked in Here, I am looking for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What clues do you find?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards headed first are scrutinized, even if they are low Brain Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Zangewell, there is no movement here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Klein nodded lightly, crossed them and left the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole process, although he is highly nervous, there is sweat behind him, but he is calm and restrained, and Ins Zangweier has no appearance from breath to breath. A little difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ability of "no face", combined with his own running, he quickly passed three levels and came to the end of the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a phantom gate made up of pure blue light, in addition to being completely sealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although worries about the battle between Azick and Ins Zangweier, Klein is still hiding in the shadow outside the room, patience After a while, I found that someone arrived through the blue light and someone left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has noticed that the person leaving must first present a heraldic-like item before he can get the permission of the four guards and enter the light door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was something out there." He was not sure about the voice of the former Archbishop. He could only deliberately hoarsely, in order to show that he had experienced a fierce battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards who were disturbed by the message until Klein approached, reacted and reached out to stop him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mr. Zangewell, what about your pass?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t delay time!" Klein said as he pulled a coat of arms from his pocket. , stuffed into the other's hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This calm performance allowed the rest of the guards to relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the moment when the guards who got the "passport" looked down, Klein suddenly flew! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just landed, quickly picked up a roll, and directly into the secluded blue door! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the guard discovered that the coat of arms in the palm quickly faded and became a note paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top left of this note is also printed with the most common greetings:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy New Year !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abyssal dark crack filled with illusory darkness Liquid, and the surface of the water is still rising, with a pale skin of arms madly protruding out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ins. Zangweier has a general understanding of Aziq’s standards, and he is not surprised or fearful because he has a demigod at this time. Half-man's helper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is most worried about another problem. The "0-08" after forcibly promoting the development of the story may be countering himself at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, his eyes were swept away, and he suddenly found that the "0-08" feather pen did not know when he had left his pocket and floated in gray. In front of the rock wall, crazy words are written in a line: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...In the fierce battle, there will always be various accidents, such as Ince Zangewell’s belt is broken and the pants are falling.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blue light filled Klein's eyes, creating a layer of overlapping light between the deep darkness and the invisible creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not observe the environment, and even rolled over to the end of the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up, took care of the clothes, restored the serious expression of Ins Zangweier, and stepped into the light curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he found himself in another room, and there were also a lot of guards here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a problem at the bottom of the ground, optimistic about this, not let anyone enter." Klein calmly told him not to walk slowly toward the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Mr. Zanggewell!" The guards answered with a compliment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the previous guards came through the blue light and shouted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There was a problem with Zangweier!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of sight followed the door, and Klein’s figure was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬, the guards immediately divided several, scattered to find the target, and informed the rest of the companions, the scene was quite chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them just passed around the corner and saw the back of Ins Zangweier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, he pulled out the sparkling electric sword and smashed it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
