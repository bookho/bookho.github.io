			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem." Klein tried to keep his tone low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He placed his left elbow on the armrest of the high back chair, his fingers holding the slightly overturned forehead with less force, and posing a calm listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger has considered the language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Antigonus is an ancient The family, their history can even be traced back to the catastrophic era before the Quaternary, related to the second 'stone slate'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second piece of slate "?" Can the "stone slate" still have a second piece? How many pieces does it have? Klein's nephew shrank, almost changing his posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the sayings of "upside down people" and "justice", "the slate" records the twenty-two ways of God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two important items, even more? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-two ways of God...Sequence path... Hey, can these two nouns be equal? Every complete sequence of pathways is the way to the throne of God? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Klein emerged one by one because of the "second 'stone slate'" description, he believes that if it is not rich The gray mist is hidden, and most of his emotional reactions have already been discovered by the "audience" lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the term "catastrophic era", he is no stranger to a professional, this is the name of the Tertiary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this period of review, Klein even knew that the Tertiary was divided into two eras: the glory days and the disaster years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second '亵渎石板'?" Audrey expressed doubts without cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has not yet calmed down and completely returned to the "audience" state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask! Klein secretly sang for Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an inconvenient question for the "fool" status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger looked at the blind person, saw that the other person’s posture had not changed, and did not stop, so he thought about the following:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first 'stone slate' appeared in the Dark Ages, the second period in which we humans struggled to survive under the blessing of the gods. The second 'stone slate' appeared at the end of the Third Age. It can even be said that its appearance marks the end of the disaster era."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The information of these two 'stones' is that the seven churches are strictly confidential. Content, I only know a little, only know that they all involve the path of God, and they are different from each other, I am not sure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is the slate seen by Sel's Emperor the first, or the second?" Audrey asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Klein recalled the description of the name of the potion by Alger at the first meeting. He said that the names of the sequence potions came from "亵渎slate"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Similarly, the captain also mentioned that the formation and improvement of the potion system depends on the birth of the 'stone slate'... which indirectly proves that the path of God is the sequence. Way!” Klein gave a silent answer to his question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "downside down" Alger simply said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second Block."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ao Lili turned quiet and re-entered the "audience" state, no longer asked again, only focused on "downside down" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that Alger is quite uncomfortable, he endured the emotions in his heart, and his voice continued slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "In the Solomon dynasty of the Quaternary, although the Antigonus family was also a prominent aristocrat, it did not leave an impressive story until they supported the establishment of the Tuyu Empire. To the center of the northern continent stage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At that time, ancient names such as Antignus, Amon, Abraham, and Jacob shined in the kingdom of mankind. However, after the Battle of the Four Emperors, the blood emperors of the Tuyu Empire fell, and they fell to the top and were chased by the seven gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The specific process, I don't know, I only know that the Antigonus family was finally destroyed in the hands of the night church, Mr. Fool, if you want to know more, I am afraid I can only get it from the night church, or contact them. An old secret organization, you know which one I am referring to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know... Klein’s heart nodded:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret will count as one, the captain and the old Neil’s Moss The training will count one, the psychological alchemy will not know if it counts...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he silently counts, Alger gives the final message:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sequence method that the Antigonus family has mastered, I don’t know, but in the related description, there are two adjectives that appear repeatedly: that is, weird, terrible "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singular and terrible... Think about the note, think about the original owner and his classmates, and Riel Bieber’s mother. Encounter, it is more appropriate... Klein's other hand's finger tapped the edge of the long table, several times in a row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he paused slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, I am very satisfied with this reward. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he has to repeatedly tap the long table with his fingers is to strengthen this action, let "justice" and "downside down" believe that they are light The habit of knocking on something to hide the opening and closing of the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my pleasure." Alger did not mention anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey looked at the "downside down" and looked at the "fool" and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I asked the second question, what are the follow-up potions of the 'audience'? Where can I find clues?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also want to ask this directly, but different choices have to bear different problems... Klein did not open his mouth and turned his eyes to "downside down." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger was silent for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am answering this question for free, because it is me Guide you to this path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The audience 8 follow-up sequence 8 is called 'reader', the ancient name of sequence 7 is 'spiritual analyst ', now described as 'psychologist', this is what I know from a member of a psychological alchemy club, I think they should have a lot of potion recipes for this route."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychological Alchemy... "Psychic" Dai Li agrees with some of their theories, and the captain thinks it is evil, crazy... Klein thoughtfully listens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know the whereabouts of the members of the psychological alchemy club?" Audrey asked with bright eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the "reader" or "psychologist", it is quite in line with her aesthetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger laughed a little hard:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know, he sinks in Sunia Nearby, I personally sank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to find a psychological alchemy club, then I can only say sorry, the clue is broken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not worried that "justice" will determine his identity through the description just now, because that thing is done by him alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shen..." Audrey did not know what expression and language to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a breath and suddenly couldn’t hold the "audience" state, a little embarrassed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The third question, if, I mean, if an ordinary animal drinks the potion of sequence 9, what will happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is this ghost problem... Klein's fingers on his forehead tapped his eyebrows without revealing his mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he saw from the change in color that Audrey’s mood was a bit flustered, a bit nervous, a bit shy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
