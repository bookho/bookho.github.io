			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ready?" Colin turned to the window and asked without any abnormality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derrick, who is not the "Hurricane Axe", slightly lowered his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Preparation Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these two months, with all the patrol missions and hard work, he fully grasped the extraordinary abilities of the "Sun God Official". Distance digestion is not too far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most hopeful thing for him now is to get the potion formula of the "Sun" route sequence 6 in the next two or three Tarot gatherings, laying the foundation for his continued improvement. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——“Shepherd” Lovia was released, giving him a strong sense of crisis, thinking that only by reaching the same sequence 5 can effectively contain the other side, Eliminate the potential crisis of Silver City. However, if you are familiar with the "playing the law" and are not lacking in extraordinary materials, as long as you can survive in the patrol and exploration missions again, and accumulate enough merits, Sequence 6 can definitely aim. The goal, but the sequence 5 of a particular ritual is quite difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin’s messy Colin nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“After two days, I will Leading an exploration team to the giant Wang Ting, to clean up the afternoon town that was found before, and your ability is very suitable for this kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Afternoon town..."Derek, who has been crazy about "remediation" in recent months, is no stranger to this term. This is the only way for the country of silver to go to the giant Wang Ting, where humans and giants live together. The town is surrounded by ancient gods that are always fixed at dusk, like the last door of the real world to myths and legends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the chief lord." Dairik could not find a reason for refusal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White City" Nas, in a hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat behind the table and looked at the clouds changing in shape, waiting quietly for the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 8 o'clock, he will board the flagship "Future" of the Star Pirates at Pier 6 and head to the easternmost side of the Sunia Sea, regardless of Gard. What happened to the Gass and the waters of the pirate park no longer have anything to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he will be able to walk on the streets and lanes, and there will be a privilege of pirate tolerance in the bars and casinos, without trying to hunt them, so as not to disturb themselves to find mermaid s plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My spiritual instinct tells me that at noon the "slayer" Gilshies seems to be eyeing me... if he really wants to deliver it, I It’s not too mindful, um, strategically despised, tactically attached, and without the use of “Poseidon Scepter” and “Tinder” gloves, I am at least a little stronger than him, winning in full and strange... Klein semi-closed With your eyes on it, imagine the countless balls of light that are gathered together, so as to quickly enter the state of meditation and maintain the spiritual acumen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, his inspiration suddenly touched and his eyes opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the sun has fallen to the west, the red color burns the sea, and the shadow of the curtain drags long in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow seems to have come alive, first wandering, and then twisted and stood up, projected onto the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is dark and dark, like the bottom of the human heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the scene without expression, raised his left palm and slowly stretched his fingers in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark shadow of the voice is as rough as an emery cloth, looking at Klein Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "German Sparo!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not insert things in the hands of the noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the shadow slid down like water, and it disappeared into the shadows and restored its original state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not pay attention to the change of shadow, but turned his eyes to the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see that the person who manipulates the shadow is somewhere on the opposite street, so there is no idea of ​​doing something to the illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, the 'slaughter' Gilthias recognized that I am a crazy adventurer who loves hunting pirates, Germain Sparo, so noon He turned away without hesitation, he may not be afraid of me, but there were other more powerful adventurers at the time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He just showed the ability, with Baekeland De Na's "Apostles of Desire" is a bit like, more and more like the extraordinary of the 'Devil' route...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, take the 'immortal king' To scare me, thinking that this will make me succumb? I never thought about blending! So, I was a bit curious... I figured it out, looking for a mermaid is the most important thing at the moment, you can’t make an accident yourself. ..." Klein took back his gaze and whispered a few words in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally thought about whether or not to inform the Nass’s God of War Church by the way, but after seriously thinking, he found that it would hardly make much sense. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The God of War Church is the only legal religion of the Fossac Empire. The number of high-ranking strong people is indeed a little more than that of the Goddess Church, but also a little, even if The goddess of the Upper Fossac royal family and the military, in the vast territory of the country and the colony, because there are too many key places to protect, the manpower is also tight, away from the empire, the geographical location is ordinary, and only whaling is relevant for the time being. The developed Gargas Islands are undoubtedly only in the second sequence, without the guards of the saints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the information that Klein learned beforehand, the Archbishop of Gargas of the God of War is only the "guardian" of Sequence 5, and he is sentenced to one of the courts. The official, a baron of the royal family, and a brigadier of the military, together constitute the extraordinary force on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the existence of seals is the key to guaranteeing this rule. Klein suspects that Nas's Ares Church has at least one "1" seal. In order to cooperate with the fleet and the extraordinary, to ensure that the whale oil refining industry, the "grey amber" foreign trade industry is not controlled by pirates, to ensure that it does not become a vassal of one of the "four kings", to ensure that in the case of sudden attacks, can support To the reinforcements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, the official power of the Gargas Islands is always in a state of contraction and defense, and pirates are allowed to enter and exit here as long as they do not make a big deal. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notification is useless... No wonder it’s called the pirate paradise. No wonder Bilt is going to organize an adventurer’s mutual aid... Klein’s awkwardness gave up the previous plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, after a break, Klein took out the gold-shelled pocket watch and opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that at 7 o'clock, he began to hold a ceremony, summoning himself, responding to himself, taking in different things to get out of the fog, and adjust his configuration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you will take the "Future" adventure at sea, "Fishman Sleeve" and various spells in the Poseidon field are a must, so Klein will "fire "Gloves and "sun brooch" stay on top of the fog, with "squirming hunger" as the main force, with "biotoxin bottle" and a revolver with different extraordinary bullets - he has seven "purification bullets" left. 13 "hunting bullets" and 2 "exortion bullets". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a jacket, Klein puts a brass Aziz whistle on the surface of the table and a wallet with only 50 pounds of cash on the inside of the garment. Pockets, then put the silver adventurer harmonica and spells together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, he touched the pistol under his arm, gently rubbed the blue wrists on the left wrist, and buttoned the double-breasted long dress. Wear a half-height silk hat, mention a black suitcase with only a change of laundry and a small amount of daily necessities, open the door, walk out of the hotel, and take a carriage to the port area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a while at Pier 6, he saw a huge sailboat slowly appearing in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to limited ship knowledge, Klein knows that this length of sailing is unscientific, but this does not prevent the other side from moving gently on the dark sea. The lighthouse that shines is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
