			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which, how long has the Mr. Member died?" Klein asked as he picked up and pointed to the core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it exceeds 15 minutes, the information that can be harvested will be reduced to the cliff type. For more than one hour, only the coarser things will be obtained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is more than 1 month, Psychic itself has a great probability of failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the preliminary inspection report showed that Mr. Maynard’s death was between 9 and 11 o'clock last night." Dunn shook his head. "You Just need help, don't worry about whether you have something to gain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein took off his coat, put on his hat and cane, and went to the outdoor line. Dunn Smith replaced him for the Chanis Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in theory, as an extraordinary person, as long as his spirituality is improved, things like spiritual vision, divination and ritual magic can be learned. In particular, the "sleepless" sequence is also known for its high inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in reality, the differences between the different "professionals" in different sequences are still very obvious, such as Dunn Smith and Leonard Mitchell are currently Mastering the vision, but the color of the gas field they see is only pale or light blue, and it is impossible to accurately distinguish the state of different parts of the human body. Of course, they are able to directly see the ghosts and spirits in the state of vision. But this is not as simple and effective as its own inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also caused the "sleepless" "midnight poet" and "nightmare" do not like to open the problem of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, if they are willing, they can also learn how to use the spirit, the rod, the dream divination, etc., but the success rate is not worth looking forward to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true of the ritual magic field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two passed by, Dunn suddenly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just forgot to say This matter is also in charge of the inspector of Tolle, who will wait for you in the reception hall of the security company, remember to replace your new uniform with new documents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Klein asked without any surprise: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New uniforms, new documents? The efficiency of the Tingen Police Department is very high." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was promoted to the sequence 8 yesterday...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because this case is very important, so... Dunn spread his hand and sat down to the position before Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein returned all the way upstairs, did not rush to the reception hall, but entered the rest room of the night, and solved the personal problem in the attached bathroom - The toilet, water bottle and basin are only available in the duty room. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he put on a special police uniform that upgraded to two silver stars and a soft hat with a "double sword cross and a crown". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After transferring the "Yangyan Charms", "Azick Copper Whistle" and "Ceremony Materials", Klein took his clothes and walked out with a cane. lounge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After passing the partition, he saw the Into Inspector sitting in the sofa area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the tall police officer became more mellow, his belly became more and more popular, with thick beards and hair, just like just from the circus The same as the brown bear that escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very happy to be able to work with you." Toller was the night-watcher who knew it. He suddenly sighed and stood up and stretched out the paw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, palm... Klein silently corrected himself and held his hand in a courtesy manner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Me too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Toller glanced at the glittering epaulettes of Kline’s two silver stars, a little envious: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are level, this is less than a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wanted to be serious Say, "The danger we may endure may be ten times that of you," but when it comes to your mouth, you think of your current identity - the "clown" of Sequence 8. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you can try it... He uses the mind to reflect on the facial expressions, his mouth is upturned, and the smile clearly answers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe there are two or three months, You have to call me the sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really humorous." Tolle laughed and pointed out the door. "Let's go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein didn't give up his cane. For him, after becoming a "clown", this "weapon" is worthy of the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black thorn security company's door, Klein and Tolle side by side, a thin and fat, the contrast is very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think we can even go to the circus to tease those audiences." Klein suddenly smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toleer agrees with the nod: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I think our contrast is very There is a comedy effect. Do you know that some circuses are trying to perform with a combination of fat, thin and tall clowns."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, actually, I mean The animal trainer and the brown bear... Klein certainly does not say such rude words, he echoed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, we in Tingen There is no fixed circus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but we also have an opera house, a grand theater, and a concert hall." Reluctantly respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sneaked into the carriage of the police station, and until this time, Klein turned the subject to the case:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the Maynard determined to be murdered?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not sure, but his wife, his two sons, I don't want to believe in the possibility of sudden illness. Well, there are some problems on the spot. When Maynard was discovered, she didn't wear a little clothes, so she was lying on the bed in the room." Tolle said with discretion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He and his wife are sleeping in separate rooms?" Klein leaned back against the carriage, mimicking the protagonists of the various detective films he had seen in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tole shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, his wife is not in Tining in recent days She went to Bakerland to attend an important social dance. You may not know that she is the leader of a new party, the daughter of the lower house. She is still on the steam train back to Tingen, just by telegraph. Expressing his own attitude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Menard is also a member of the New Party and has been a member of the city of Tingen for more than a decade. He intends to run in the election next year. Aim at the position of the mayor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, his death may be related to this?" Klein asked casually, and immediately laughed. "I just help." 'Autopsy', other things are not within the scope of my concern, you can not answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tole is not too concerned to sigh:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Autopsy...you are very cautious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" As for your guess, I can only say Xu, last night, Mr. Maynard held a party at home. There were too many guests coming and going. We have no way to identify the main suspects at the moment. Moreover, these guests have a decent identity. We must be cautious and not make mistakes." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." Klein gently decapitated and asked some details of the scene with great interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menard’s home is located in the Golden Sycamore area and is a single-family house surrounded by gardens and lawns, with stables, fountains and concrete. Broad road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wears a bonnet with a police coat of arms, next to the Tolre Inspector, through a void line of imprisonment, in the position of a police officer Looking into the main entrance of the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the living room area, two men, two women and four trainee inspectors are looking for people to talk and collect confessions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at it and found a lot of gentlemen wearing tuxedos, as well as several ladies in the court dress with gorgeous, fine-grained veil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are all guests who stayed here last night." Tolle explained, leading Klein to the ladder and heading straight to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way, perhaps the effect of the inspector's epaulettes, the police officers who searched the house saw that both of them showed a respectful look, without any hindrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the room where the body of Maynard was found." The tall, burly Tolle was parked in front of a deep red wooden door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein asked thoughtfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who belongs to this room last night? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who doesn't belong to anyone, this house has too many guest bedrooms, it doesn't come in handy." Tolle wears white gloves and reaches for a hand A deep red wooden door was opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let the police officer in charge of the guard leave temporarily and point to Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The Moretti Inspector, I will hand it over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the goddess bless you and me, hopefully there will be gains." Klein also put on White gloves, locked the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked to the bed and watched the dark red sheets messy, while lying on the top with a white cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is now a person who has seen the world. He does not fear to open the white cloth and looks to the Mayor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gentleman is in his forties, his blond hair is very short, and there is a mixture of pain and joy on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stepped back two steps and took out the appropriate materials to quickly prepare for the psychic ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a mantra, he meditated on the divination statement that he had long thought of in the quiet and scent of the fragrance and the cold wind that surrounds himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason why Mr. Mayner died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason why Mr. Maynard died." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While meditating, Klein stepped back in front of the high back chair and sat down slowly. Go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned black, and leaned back, and quickly entered the sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the illusory, confusing and awkward world, he suddenly saw the gentleman just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menard stared at the blue eyes and was sprinting on a woman with a fair-skinned skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first showed the extreme satisfaction of extreme pleasure, then violently retracted his right hand, holding his chest, and his expression was distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Maynard falling, the picture quickly shattered, and Klein opened his eyes and woke up from his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect that I could see a small smear in this way... So, Mr. Maynard is dying in a bed of sin, and dying too hard. ? Klein smiled and slammed his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the pen and paper and used the ceremony again to paint the lady who saw it in the dream. Of course, the neck is omitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a woman who is hard to tell the specific age. She has a mature taste in her thirties, and she has the innocent taste of youthfulness. Her eyes are Moist and shiny, giving a pitiful feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the work of "self", Klein packed up the ceremonial materials and lifted the wall of spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned over his body and the detective grabbed the silver-plated black stick leaning against it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he heard the sound of the lotus in his throat, causing a squeaky sound on the surface of the skin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the bed violently, only to see Mr. Mayn’s hands clinging to the dark red sheets and grabbing the black and white bursts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
