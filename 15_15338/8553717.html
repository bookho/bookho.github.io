What is the current title? There is no similar news circulating in Beckland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted man" Alger slowly nodded :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a lady, formerly a famous pirate, 'disease girl' Trey, you should have heard of it?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't know much about this." Audrey shook his head honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also...the top of the sorghum "fool" Klein echoed a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger is silent for two seconds, without wasting time explaining, directly saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In short, she In the last month, he conquered the fleet of Qilingus and proved that he had the strength of a pirate general. She renamed the ship of Qilingus as the 'black death' and claimed to be 'the disease.'" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She used to be a single activist, good at using curses, black fire, frost, and her hostile people will always have sudden illness, various diseases At present, no one knows which way she belongs, but she is sure that she is at the level of sequence 5."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey listened with gusto, stunned Under the eyes, curiously ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'Inverted man', can you tell us more about the four pirate kings and six other pirate generals? I have only heard of their names and nicknames, and I don’t know what extraordinary abilities they have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger looks around Seeing "Sun" and "World" all put on a listening gesture, so gently sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most powerful pirate king is the 'King of the Five Seas' Nast, who claims to be a descendant of the Solomon Empire of the Quaternary, not only a high sequence strongman, but also The horror ghost ship 'Black Emperor' left by the empire, he is good at using order, can pull the enemy to fight in the field he is best at, and create all kinds of incredible effects..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is also the oldest pirate. It is said that he was active in the Five Seas in the post-Russell era more than a hundred years ago. No one knows how many years he is."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, compared to the king of another pirate, he has enough information. For the owner of the 'Dawn', we only know that she is a beautiful woman. Once a wizard, now also entered the field of demigods, her title is 'mysterious queen'." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction to the "four kings", "downside down" Alger turned the topic Into the remaining six pirate generals: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 'Black Tulip' owner Ludwell was once a subordinate of the 'King of the Five Seas' and later became independent Self-proclaimed 'Hell Admiral', the rumor has established a certain degree of connection with the spiritual group. He is a powerful psychic who can drive all kinds of spiritual creatures, both horrible and strange. It is said to have an ancient death. The remaining ring. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The star above the 'Cardelia has followed the 'mysterious queen', but the two sides have been almost broken for a long time, for the reason of this matter, The rumor at sea is that she joined a secret organization that angered the 'mysterious queen', and according to the news I received, the secret organization was the Moss. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moss accompaniment..."The voyeur of the secluded person...the hidden sage...Klein Horan thought of the loss of control of the old Neil, thought of The evil spirit that will seduce in the same way as the low-sequence extraordinary person.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his first time in reality, not in books, knowing Moss The news of the martyrdom!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, "downside down" Alger also introduced the suspected evil spirits that are not human "the blood above" Senol "Deep sea lieutenant" Hal. Constantine, who has some of the sea monster blood, Edwina Edwards, who calls himself "Lieutenant of the Iceberg" and "Twilight Lieutenant" Bratov Ivan.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, ‘Justice’, this is definitely not as beautiful as you think. In my opinion, this is a combination of bloody, chaotic, killing, desire, and fear.” Alger quietly poured cold water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey nodded and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beckland has recently happened A serial killing case, a total of 11 cases, but one of them was confirmed to be a copy of the crime, this serial killing is characterized by women who have been street girls but currently have a formal career, the murderer will cut their abdomen "Take away all the internal organs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This sounds related to admiring demons, what do people who worship blood?" "Inverted people" Alger instantly Just made a guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, I haven't found the murderer yet." Audrey couldn't wait to be a detective, take Su Shi, and grab the abominable guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the "Sun" Dairik snorted straight out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know this kind of ritual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows? Also, before the Cataclysm, especially in the Second Era, the demon was active in the real world and was active on the ground. It was the object of the two forces of the giants and the dragons. The corresponding records of the Silver City are normal...they The history has not been tampered with and has not been altered, nor has it broken... Klein looked thoughtfully at the "sun" and waited for him to say more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know?" "Justice" Audrey is delighted to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derrick nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have mentioned in the textbook of 'Demonology' It is quite old and is a ritual used by the devil to assist in his promotion. It often appears in the sequence of 6 liters. 5."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not a ritual to please the devil, it is a demon Auntie used to assist in his promotion?" Audrey asked quite surprisedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derrick answers very seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sequence of the 'Abyss' pathway 6 It is called 'demon', which is also the source of their family name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abyss" approach? Before the Cataclysm, the "demon" route was called the "abyss" route, and the "demon" was just the name of the sequence 6... Is it... sequence 0, abyss? Klein once again discovered the value of the "Sun" classmates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of knowledge and secrets that have been dissipated in the history of the river, there are still in the city of Silver! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way..." Audrey is not visible to the dagger. "Mr. Sun, do you know the specific content of this ceremony?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick nodded his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The minimum is 13 people, the highest is 49, the more the ceremony Complete, the more hopeful promotion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Between two killings, at least three days apart, otherwise it is easy to get out of control, but the interval can not exceed nine days, that would Let the ceremony be reset."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every time you kill, after every part of the ceremony, the devil will eat the victim's internal organs. From this point on, he will always be violent. Blood, want to hurt others, until the desire is satisfied again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s terrible..." Audrey sighed sincerely, feeling I can't even bear to imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is sitting in the thick fog, listening in silence, remembering it in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discussing the serial killings, "Justice" Audrey looked to Alger and organized the following language:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. 'Inverted Man', there is something, I have always had some doubts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have participated in several extraordinary gatherings, It was found that very few people sell magic potion formulas, even if they are, it is difficult to deal with them. Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
