			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesday morning, Joewood District, opposite Coim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sits on a wooden bench outside the door of the Gardner department store, holding a paper bag in one hand, inside the most famous Xinji Dixi stuffing nearby. Cake, holding a cup of sweet ice tea in one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside his side, the tramp huddled and slept on the other side of the bench, but after ten minutes, he was awake by the security guards in the mall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein’s nose is covered with gold-rimmed glasses and a half-height silk hat, which is no different from most gentlemen who come and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leisurely looked at the Coim company across the road, raised his right hand, biting his mouth and remembering the Dixi pie, only the meat sauce Thick, full of aftertaste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pie from Desi Bay can stand out in the pies of the South, relying on the oil, willing to use fat, but It was very smashed, fat and thin, and not greasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The juice with a thick fleshy immersed in the outer crust, neutralized the dryness, made up for the shortcomings, and made the wheat scent clearly Come out, and the small pieces of broken apples are mixed with a slightly sweet taste to stimulate the appetite and dissolve the oily taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also... Beckland, although the weather is bad, the pollution is serious, but other aspects are really better than Tingen, and different styles of food can be found in different places. All kinds of operas and dramas can be seen as long as they are not afraid of spending money... Although they may not go to eat, they will go to see, but at least they have the right to choose. This is the advantage of the metropolis... Klein picks up sweet iced tea. Take a sip of comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sight never left the door of Coim, for the 10 pounds of income, he sat here at 8 o'clock, breakfast was bought on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, for most private detectives, a single commission of 10 pounds is definitely an enviable deal, which is equivalent to about 3 weeks for the normal middle class. The salary is gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the information provided by Mary Gay, her husband is currently the first manager of Coim, the boss of Luke Samuel. However, the shares of Coim's company they hold are derived from Mary's father and are the inheritance of her inheritance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the direct reasons why she suspects that her husband has a mistress is that a staff member in the company revealed to her that Doragu Gale will be alone on Wednesdays and Friday mornings. I left until the afternoon, and he got off work two days a week, and Mary never saw her husband stepping into the house before seven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast, Klein waited for more than an hour and finally saw the target person out of Coim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears a black top hat, wearing a double-breasted coat made of standard, wearing a standard bow tie, slightly fat, yellowish horns, brown eyes The face is a bit long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doragu.Gail... Klein read the name of the target, brushed up, put on his cane and the heavy portable camera, The opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doragu did not let his driver pick it up, stood on the side of the road, looked around and looked for a rental carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opportunity, Klein crosses the road, comes to his side, fake careless, and hit the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I am looking for a way." Klein bowed his head and apologized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doraguton frowned, but kept silent and waved his hand, indicating nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was busy bending over and bowing, and then went to the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just hit Doraga, not to steal the other’s belongings, so that the tracking can be easily done with the “Budget Method”, which is too easy to be found. I noticed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of collision, Klein only did one thing, that is, the spare button of his double-breasted long dress, with the help of the "clown" agility, quietly Stuffed into one of the decorative pockets of the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned the street, he stopped and looked back, just to see Doragu boarding a rental carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't hurry to follow up, waited patiently for a few minutes, and then slowly sneaked into another carriage, saying to the coachman:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow my instructions, first come The street at the end of the street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." The coachman did not ask why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the carriage, Klein began to divination with a cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his divination statement did not point to Doragu Gale, but became the "fall of my clothes spare button"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Buddle Method" was originally the most practical use for finding things. Only the "Divination" can use it to find people. Klein has restored it this time. The original appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most convenient and easiest to find items are the types that belong to them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way, Klein kept the driver in the direction and finally arrived at a street house in the Hillston area. He noticed that there is a garden behind the lawn, which is different from the average house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His "Buddle Method" tells him that Doralgu Gale is in this house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; paid 2 Soule’s fare, Klein went to the door with a marble statue, and saw two standing in black and white uniforms seem to be imitating the police. man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know you, your membership certificate?" One of the men of the South Continent, brown-skinned, reached out and stopped Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Membership certificate?" Klein hid the heavy camera behind him and asked with a slight frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man with brownish skin suddenly caught his face:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the Cragg Club Only guests with our members and members can enter, only one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do I join your club?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can only join if you get the recommendation of two members." The man did not violently drive away, but patiently answered the other's questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cannot guarantee that the other party will join the club if he turns his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein took a fancy and decided to start Plan B. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found a hotel near the Cragg Club and asked for a short four-hour home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he locked the door, pulled the curtains, and entered the fog, giving the front a yellow-brown parchment and a round belly pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a breath, Klein wrote the same divination statement as before:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I The drop of the spare button of this dress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, it is no longer the "Buddle Method" but the "Dream Divination Law"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why it is not outside, is because Klein feels that the so-called Craig Club looks quite high-end, and suspects that there may be more powerful extraordinary people, in order not to Wasting time, just once in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray dream world, Klein first saw Dorag’s black coat, which was hung on the coat rack, in front of it. A round table on the carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture stretches, the rolling men and women are reflected in Klein’s eyes, the man’s is Doragu Gael, the female’s blonde is bright, young and light Very much in his early twenties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frowning expression of her frown is quite flattering... Why do I always see this picture... Kline blinked and woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doragu’s mistress’s things should be ok...how is it to get substantial evidence...in a way of responding to prayer? But this is limited to the acquisition of itself, can only rely on sketch, can not pass the camera ... I can not easily draw a photo out of it? It seems that today is not enough. Waiting to follow the woman and figure out her address and name. I don't believe it. Every time they are dating in the Craig Club... Detective Klein quickly got the next idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
