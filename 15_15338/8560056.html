			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byyam is here? Klein heard that he stood up and looked out and saw the familiar rebel private port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t show any surprise, but he said calmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s faster than I thought." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is at least three hours ahead of his expectations! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s faster than I expected." Edwina regained her gaze and agreed with the words of German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is an insignificant detail... Klein lowered his head and casually flipped through the rest of the book Three Worlds, and then Handed to "Iceberger Lieutenant": <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Communication ends here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aide Wenna looked at the book in silence, opened her mouth and closed it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took over the "Book of the Three Worlds" and placed it on the table, then got up and walked the court:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I look forward to the opportunity to communicate with you in the future. Your accomplishments in ancient history are admirable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is Klein himself His character, he will certainly be modest, and praise the "Iceberger" has the same extensive knowledge, but now he is a crazy adventurer, German Sparrow, can only slightly nod: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are collaborators."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning is that there will be opportunities in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer said, leaving the "Captain's Room", returning to his room, easily packing his suitcase, waiting for the "Golden Dream" to enter the port, all the way down to the deck . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the deck has gathered a lot of crew members, including "foodie" Bruce Wols, "singer" Olvers, "flowers The bow tie "Jedson and other high-profile pirate groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They showed a sincere smile and waved at Klein. They were very enthusiastic. Among them, "bucket" and "iron" were even more excited. Look, and sing a song to send guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When were they so familiar with them? Klein groaned and crossed the pirates and walked to the side of the ramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson Hood leans there, his clothes are neat and his hair is smiling without a mess:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They probably want to say, goodbye, no, never see you again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German, do you know how dangerous you are during this time? Almost became the enemy of all the crew, they can't wait to take the 'Golden Dream' to Baiyam in just 5 minutes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was about to respond, but saw Daniz trotting in a black cloak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This guy is really angry and ready to leave the "Golden Dream" alone? This is a bit out of my mind, around the "Iceberger", near the "God of Knowledge and Wisdom" church, he This "fool" believer can maximize the value... However, it doesn't matter, if Daniz can grow up, it is more meaningful than this... Klein habitually measured it, and the extra thoughts were thrown away, indifferent Watching Daniz, waiting for him to speak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi’s face opened his mouth, but he couldn’t say anything, so he laughed twice. To Anderson Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a 'conspiracy' potion formula? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Anderson smiled. "But I am not going to sell it to you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz's face instantly darkened, and Anderson continued to carelessly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What is the significance of the potion formula you have now got the 'conspiracy'? You are trying to upgrade now, definitely out of control! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friend, you play the next 'hunter' again, followed by 'provocate' and 'arsonist', oh, that 'the heart of the giant' You'd better find the 'artisan' to make a magical item of defensive nature, or I'm afraid that you will be killed when you are dead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait until you are sure that you have the confidence, and then find the potion formula that your captain wants to 'conspiracy', she has.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, oh, I think you That's it, the 'conspiracy' is very demanding. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz was ridiculed and twitched, while carefully remembering every word that Anderson said, because this is the guy who claims to be the strongest hunter, here There is a wealth of experience in the path, and he also vaguely understands that the key is to "play". It is suspected that the previous teachings of the captain are also pointing to this aspect, but it is not so clear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "There is always one day, I will let you know, what is the real conspiracy! "Daniz's mouth is hard, and he turns to look at German Sparrow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cleared his throat and dared not look directly into the other's eyes. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have applied to the captain and will contact the Rebels frequently and will often appear in Baiam. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning is that you don't want to leave the "Golden Dream", but you will often find opportunities to exercise yourself? Oh, how do you report your work to your boss? Ryan smirked, "Hmm".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz suddenly breathed a sigh of relief, and the whole person was very comfortable, if not the companions were behind him. Looking at it, he will definitely go to help the Greman Sparrow suitcase and send it all the way to the dock.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the German and Anderson leave Cautiously, he decided to start a prayer to the "fool" every day to show his piety, so as not to have a bad accident.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebel In the private port, Anderson saw that Galman Sparo turned into a new road without thinking, and then walked out of the jungle in the shortest distance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Very familiar with here? When I last came, there was no such way. Anderson is half-sentimental and boring and casual.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, many people pray to me every day and report what they have done, and I occasionally Give a response, for example, to guide them to repair this road... Klein is smug for two seconds, and his expression is indifferent: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is your friend living? ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is in a manor outside Baiyam. Anderson stepped up and began to lead the way.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour later, he took Klein to a manor outside, where the flavors of the various spices were superbly superimposed. , mixed with an unspeakable exotic style.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After telling the gatekeeper the purpose of the visit, the two did not wait for a long time, they saw a single Medium, less than 1 meter 75 men came over, followed by a housekeeper and a servant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man was yellowish and tanned Feeling, the contour is softer, but the eye socket is much more depressed than the Lun people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Klein, it is possible to judge the origin of the other party by using this, that is The kingdom of Fenetport has people of highland human descent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man has become fat, his face is round and quite harmonious, he saw the strongest hunter, Immediately haha ​​laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anderson, are you still dead? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am waiting to attend your funeral. Anderson responded with a polite attitude, and immediately turned to Klein, "Okefa Conach, I was a team doctor." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not introduce the German law to O'Fal, but he smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I brought you a good business. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okfa second understood Anderson's meaning, did not ask in the presence of the male servant and the butler, led the two, and went to the main manor house. Bryan/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, Klein saw windmills, bakeries, wine houses, militia training camps and other buildings. The whole manor is like a small kingdom, except no blacksmith. Shop, completely self-sufficient - most steel products go to the market to buy more cost-effective than their own.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the idyllic life..." Kline said with a sigh of relief, followed Oak Law into the main house and came to his study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okfa did not let the hostess come over, nor did he hold his own children to see Anderson and Klein, obviously not wanting them to have a little contact with the dangerous mysterious world. So, after closing the door, he looked straight at Anderson: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What business?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Don't you want to sell the revolver? He is interested." Anderson pointed to Klein, "German Sparo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"German Sparo? Easily hunted the 'smart speaker' Misor's powerful adventurer?" Okfello was surprised but opened without fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is far from risky life, but he knows he can’t neglect it, so in the case of Baiam, he will take the initiative to master some necessary Message to avoid accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson heard the words and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your message is too old!<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This gentleman's current record is that he successfully hunted the 'slaughter' Gilthias and lived to this day. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gilch Ess? The second officer of the ‘Undead King’? "Okefa's expression changes, it is both horrified and hidden.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Anderson laughed and laughed. "In the paradise of pirates, he is recognized as the strongest hunter. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okefa swallowed his mouth and looked at Klein, uncomfortably revealing a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I believe you have the ability to buy a 'cancely bell'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The death knell? "Klein is quite interested but asks the face inconspicuously.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The name of the 'revolver', it is the old man who accompanied me for ten years. Oh, if it's not that it overlaps with the other magical item on my body, and it's not very useful for my current situation, I can't bear to sell it. "Okfa sighed and replied.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Anderson sneered at the side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You didn't say that before, you said that you prefer tools for farming. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A "cultivator"... Klein combined the words of Anderson and the appearance of Oak Law to make corresponding judgments.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he flashed the corresponding potion name in his mind: sequence 9 "cultivator", sequence 8 "physician", ancient "treatment priest", sequence 7 "bumper "Priest".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that Anderson introduced him to the doctor of the previous team... Klein thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Do you know Frank Lee? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, don't know, although I am a Fenetporter, my formula and materials are all picked up by myself, with The 'Damu Goddess' church has nothing to do with it, so I am totally afraid to return to Fenet, but I have heard of Frank Lee, who is a guy who makes the church quite a headache. "Okefa calmly replied, "It's just the 'biologist' of Sequence 6, which will make the church so important. Sometimes I really want to see him." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you will regret this idea... Klein sees from Oak's answer that he believes in "the Mother Earth" and is very May be the strongest of sequence 5. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson next to him, after hearing the words of Okfafa, his face twitched obviously, and he said with a lingering heart: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is really a headache, to some extent, it can be called a demon, his ability, his ideas are beyond the level of sequence 6... Ok, don't mention him. When you mention him, I will remember the milk that was sprayed out. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okfa looked at the opposite person with some puzzles, restrained curiosity, went to the table, opened the drawer, and took out a better than A normal black revolver barrel with a longer black iron pistol.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
