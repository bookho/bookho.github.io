			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the fog, Klein reached out and took out the "Poseidon Scepter" from the heap of debris, and browsed the countless spots around the seal. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of these spots corresponds to the prayer of a believer, and the glory is flowing, sacred and ethereal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Klein conducted a preliminary screening with ideas, focusing on the part that originated at sea rather than the island - he would "Poseidon Scepter" After being isolated from the fog, it is no longer possible to directly use this "artifact" to sense the surrounding oceans, and to make effective operations. It is necessary to rely on the prayer images of believers to expand the surrounding area by 5 nautical miles and affect the corresponding underwater life. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein spiritually spread, touched one of the light spots, saw the evening prayers of a native, before a fishing boat returned to Hong Kong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the changes in Klein's mind, the perspective of this picture is rapidly rising, the surrounding layers of clouds accumulate, and the dark and undulating scenes of the waves are being added more and more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few hours ago, was there a sign that the storm was brewing? Also, when I went out, I felt the environment was very depressed... so Elland It’s said that the 'Crazy Captain' Connor’s ship should be parked in the shadow of the nearby island. This is to avoid the storm...” Kline’s fingers tapped the edge of the mottled long table and silently said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this inference, his next "seeking people" work will be much easier, because there is no need to search the vast and innocent sea, just pay attention to this sea area. Near the different islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thoughts, the top of the "Poseidon Scepter" in Kline's hand, a blue-blue gem hoisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sea where there is no fishing boat, the dark blue near the black light of the blushing moon is undulating, and suddenly, the water is silent. There is a pair of exaggerated eyes looking at the sky, under the eyes, a huge shadow outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, a strip of sea fish floated near the surface of the water, with different types. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took on the glory of the glory, turned around, and each sinked and headed for different places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten seconds, the waters within 5 nautical miles returned to their previous state, and the dark blue near-black waves were once higher than once, waiting for the final outbreak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... This consumption is a bit big... Kline raised his left hand and licked his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just did not simply drive the marine life, giving them a certain extraordinary spirituality, so that they can see the pictures they see after they stop at the ships near the island. Pass it back in prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not too difficult or too complicated for the "Poseidon Scepter", but for the operator Klein, the burden is enormous, and the consumption is not small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Klein selected the prayers around the islands of the archipelago and issued “commands” to the marine life in the corresponding area in the same way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he refused to throw the "Poseidon Scepter" back into the heap of debris, returning directly to the real world, taking off his coat and falling on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual consumption of the extreme he thought he would fall asleep, who knows that his head is empty and painful, so that he can not blind his eyes, and can not enter the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein can clearly feel that his skin is like an allergy, growing a bulge, and the granulation hidden under them is more Unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, as Mr. "down man" said, if you keep your spirituality dry for two consecutive days, you will definitely have auditory hallucinations and lose control. The symptoms, I am only a limit, have not maintained for a long time, the body is a bit abnormal, of course, this is also because I have not been promoted for a long time, have not digested, and have taken the extra front sequence of potions... Klein A little bit of retrieving thoughts, trying to meditate on the cascading light balls, to calm down the body and the spirit of exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a slight relief, he finally fell asleep and felt at midnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the outside wind was fierce, heavy rain was like a note, and the storm that had been brewing for a long time finally came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is not too rare in Bayam, except for these, the night is quite peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein went to the bathroom to solve the personal hygiene problem, washed his hands, took four steps and went back into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the "Poseidon Scepter" on the bronze long table and began to browse the "pictures" that the marine creatures came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These scenes have a ship in different ports, different docks, and different island shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has not seen the "Crazy Captain" Connors Victor, but before he understood the characteristics of the other side, learned about the various signs of his pirate group . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture flashes, and Klein patiently identifies the details of those ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, he showed a joy that was difficult to conceal, letting one of the pictures zoom in and zoom in and zoom in! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found a vessel with a suspected target! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boat was moored at the leeward side of the most remote West Ham Island in the Rhodes Islands, with towering stone cliffs behind it and undulating waves below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its sails and flags have been stowed, but there is a white skull pattern on each side of the ship's side with a single eye patch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the hallmark of the Captain of the Crazy Captain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein untied the spirit of the left wrist cuff and confirmed it with divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer makes him happy, it is indeed the boat of Conax Victor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this "Crazy Captain" has only one such boat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s no wonder that most adventurers at sea know that the 'Crazy Captain' has links with the king’s traffickers and slave traders, but the storm church’s investigation into the disappearance of the colonial population But he didn't point to him. A guy who only has a bounty of only 3,300 pounds, and a pirate group who only has one boat can only do a little business. Can't afford such a large-scale population trade... What should I do next? "Klein first sighed silently, then began to consider how to investigate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His first reaction was to directly summon a huge underwater creature, take a ride like a "whale boat", take a storm and head straight to Simim Island, then Camouflage to sneak into, relying on the "Master of Secret Master" ability, does not cause too much movement to control the "Crazy Captain" Connors Victor, but after careful consideration, I feel that this method is too reckless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with other pirates who are not generals, this is fine, but since the "Crazy Captain" Connors Victor is involved in the Bakerland smog so terrible The incident must be taken into account that he usually only shows disguise, considering that he actually has another identity, and that his ship is likely to harbor a lot of secrets, so there is a high probability that there is a trap sufficient to deal with the pirate generals. If you sneak in, even if Klein is armed to the teeth, you may not be able to come out alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Summon yourself, in the form of a spirit, holding the Poseidon scepter in the past? This is to avoid accidents. If there is a problem, you can end the summoning return directly. However, the 'Poseidon Scepter' is essentially an extraordinary feature of the high sequence of the 'storm' route. As long as it appears in the real world, it is likely to attract Neptune Courtman to each other... This will make things impossible... Klein looked at the storm in the picture and had an idea in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that, he once again presented a pen and paper, writing down the divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's dangerous to deal with Connors Victor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Picking up the silver chain of the spirit, Klein converged his thoughts and began divination intently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he blinked and saw the citrine pendant spinning in a clockwise direction, with a high speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that dealing with Connors Victor is very dangerous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, as I expected, fortunately, there was no slamming..." Klein picked up the "Poseidon Scepter" and decided to implement what he thought just now. Program. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to cover the storm and use the prayer picture just now to directly attack the vessel of Connors Victor with the "Poseidon Scepter". Out of his secret! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
