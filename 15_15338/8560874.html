			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Klein finished speaking, Albert based on his description, and asked a few questions in a targeted manner to see if certain details can be matched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt he received a satisfactory answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your cooperation, I wish you a good dream." Albert smiled and got up, and by the way, the ability to use "nightmare" once again influenced Daun. Don Tae, after he woke up, he only vaguely remembered what kind of dream he had probably made and could not recall the specific content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he turned to the door, twisted the handle, and left the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the "nights" are still too convinced of the "nightmare" ability, in exchange for my leadership of this matter, will certainly design different aspects of different aspects in advance A series of questions, against each other, looking for places that are not coordinated and have loopholes... Oh, the best way is to unite the "Justice" lady, and put out several professional psychological assessment questionnaires, so that the goal is all done in the dream, if he is There are disguise, psychological state and the image that you want to express. There will be contradictions in the conclusions of different assessments. Unless he is also a psychologist, he can notice the substantive purpose of each group of questions... Klein leans back I lived on the back of the sofa and turned my eyes to the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the gray and dark world, the light of the gas street lamp is faint and pale, and the surroundings are dark and dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quietly watched for a few seconds, sketching his mouth and laughing at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bottom of the Church of St. Saul, I saw that Albert was waking up normally. After hearing his report, Leonard was relieved and then became more and more Taboo the undead Quaternary monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big Silver City, lightning strikes the sky and illuminates all streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick.Ber walked out of his house and went to the twin towers in the north of the city without a hurricane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, he met a lot of residents of Silver City, some of them are busy, some are sending their children to receive general education, and some In groups of three and five, patrolling every corner to prevent some people from accidentally dying at home, not being end-to-end, becoming a horrible evil spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of these people made Silver City look very lively, and Dairik occasionally heard the joys and laughter of the children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but recall the life in the camp in the afternoon. The number of humans he can meet every day is ten or twenty, and most of the time he has to wait. In the sturdy but sturdy building, the outside is a monster that is quietly hiding in the house in the dark. They are cleaned again and again, and they don’t know where to come out again and again, so that every member of the exploration team has produced a kind of From the inner feeling of powerlessness, it seems that there is no way to get real security. It is always difficult to be assured. Every effort must be made at all times, and there must be no slack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No normal creature has maintained this state of high alert for a long time, so there is a mature rotation system in Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The return to Silver City from the afternoon town did not cost the first time to explore the team for too long, but then it was inevitable to isolate observation and relax, until today Dairik only adjusted and thought that his mental state could support the negative impact of promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he reported to the "chief" Colin Iliad before, he got the "notary" potion formula, was allowed to use this harvest In exchange for the corresponding extraordinary material - the tail feathers of the Chilings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the things he owes to the "moon", they have been obtained through patrols around the town of the afternoon, and they have been handed over to the other through Mr. "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was promoted, I was qualified to pick a non-high sequence of magical items... Dairiky thought a little bit, thinking about speeding up, arrived The Twin Towers in the north of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although material warehouses and magical items are in the round tower, they are watched by the "six-member council", but Dairik’s destination is the minaret because There are meritorious exchange points here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party has silver-gray curls, light gray eyes and a gorgeous face. It is a member of the "six-member parliamentary group" and "shepherd" Luo Weiya! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two eyes were in contact with each other, and Luo Weiya’s eyes seemed to be able to penetrate the soul. However, her expression did not change a bit, even tapped her head, like Say hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not greeting me, is greeting the one behind me...Huo Ran, Dairik has a clear understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stems from the experience he has accumulated under the guidance of the Tarot Conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded in response, regaining his eyes without any abnormality, and entering the minaret unhurriedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byat private port at night, with strange owners along the center line The gun's "Golden Dream" drove to the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz carried the local specialties against the army and waved his hand with a smile, and climbed the deck along the ramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he lived very comfortably here. As a special envoy to send arms to send a small amount of extraordinary materials, he got a very high courtesy, not every day. Drinking and eating meat is bragging and hunting, and even invited to watch the ceremony of "Poseidon" giving blessings to believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After witnessing these things, he suddenly had a realization: Byam, or all the colonies, there will be fierce conflicts in the future, no dozens The erosion of hundreds of years will not subside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Daniz decided to sell most of his home in Baiam next time, leaving only one of them, and then looking for opportunities. Buying houses in the city of Tries, the capital of the city of Luis, and the countryside of the peaceful and peaceful countryside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can go back to the town of Nocière and see the old man and mother, um, the house can buy one less and give them a vineyard... Niz once again waved to the enthusiastic rebel forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately stood up and proudly said to the "flower bow tie" Jodson Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Where is the captain? I want to report to her about the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseson snorted dismay:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course in the captain's room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he whispered in his heart:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz this guy, and after the relationship with German Sparrow, is getting more and more proud! However, the crazy adventurer was really terrible, and he managed to hunt "the blood will be"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." Daniz laughed, stepping into the cabin and seeing "Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina Edward. Here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He instantly put away the provocative look, squinted and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain I have already completed the task."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The specific process." Edwina put down the books in her hand and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi has been prepared to describe in detail the experience of this period of time, and exaggerated his role, the end: <br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, I have met German Sparro, he asked me to ask if the elf singer Shattrath's body and the gold wine glass are abnormal."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina did not answer directly, got up and walked to the corner of the captain's room, where a black wooden box was placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The "Golden Dream" will not travel to Sonia after this voyage, so the corpses of Shatas and Mobert are still on board. I was admitted to the box specially prepared by Edwina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One knee bent, half awkward, Edwina opened the wooden box and let the corpses that were staggered inside appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
