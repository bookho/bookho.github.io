			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which language you speak, can you understand each other? Klein's focus is directly on the first sentence of Edwina, the "Iceberger Lieutenant", placed on the second sentence that looks like no big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is in the world of books created by Grosser Travels, everything is possible, but the details of certain things can still indicate certain problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Klein, it’s not that they understand each other, but in what way they understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world has solidified rules similar to the language, and there is still a sense of arrogance on the crowd, assisting in the completion of simultaneous interpretation, just like I am at the tower What did Luo do on? If it is the former, the goal of not knowing the giant language is to hear strange language, but you can understand the meaning. If the latter, you will hear the familiar language... because you have mastered many ancient or supernatural languages, Ryan couldn't make an accurate judgment for a while, slowed down a little, and side by side with Daniz, and lowered his voice and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just heard Grosell said What language is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz took a second and recalled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A little familiar but unfamiliar language, but I can understand all the meaning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supernatural language he fully masters is the ancient Hermes, followed by the elves. Language, in the giant language can only be just getting started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, similar to the rules of linguistic...the understanding of the mind level... This shows that the underlying rules of the world in the book can be different from the outside world, from the self Set, but the change does not seem to exceed a certain limit, this is doubtful, to be verified, after all, can not rule out the existence of a "fool", the possibility of completing the translation by means of spiritual communication... Edwina is really keen, And good at observation, the problem found directly refers to the nature of the world in this book... Thinking, Klein did not enter the black cave. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the strange history of the members of the protagonist, he was not surprised at all, and even waited for details in this regard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has long known that the major churches and the northern continents are consciously destroying or hiding information, concealing the Quaternary, Tertiary, and even the Second The true history, the content of the outside world is naturally different from the members of the protagonists who have survived in those years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the reasons why Klein is taking a certain risk into the world of books! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wide and airy cave, there are three humanoid creatures scattered around a pile of bonfires emitting light and heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them is wearing a simple white robes, facing away from the flames, facing the stone wall, closing his eyes, praying with confidence, is a wrinkle but not too old The middle-aged man, who has brown hair, bare shoulders, arms, calves and feet, is covered with all kinds of old scars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a young man sleeping on the stone next to him, wearing a heavy, tough black body armor with a black straight sword in his hand. The outline of the five senses is quite profound and has obvious Lun characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite of these two is a 30-year-old man who is dressed in a peculiar manner and is uncomfortable. He wears a pointed black hat. The coat button is up and down, and it is asymmetrical and uncoordinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the leather boots he wore pointed high, quite like a clown in a circus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man has a pretty good face, linen hair, dark brown eyelids with a tall nose and thin lips, even if sitting It also gives people a feeling of pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina pointed to the other: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mobart of the Solomon Empire. Viscount Zorojas, a gentleman who can take away the ideals and dreams of others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to be euphemistic, hello, I am a 'stealer' The sequence of the route 5, 'Theft of the Dreamer'." Mobett laughed, not as arrogant as the temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member of the Zoroastrian family... Leonard’s body is a paradise of an angel of this family, perhaps know? Oh, I know what the sequence 5 and sequence 4 of the "stealer" route are, but it is not clear that the corresponding sequence 7 and sequence 6... Kline's surface flashed a lot of thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Anderson had greeted each other with a smile and awkwardly, asking in a familiar manner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frankly, I first heard of theft Dreamer, I only know the 'stealers' and 'scammers', and there are still two sequences missing in between."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The extraordinary people in this path are scarce Is it at this level? Did Edwina not know? Sequence 7, 'Decryption Scholar', Sequence 6, 'Stolen Fireman', haha, I will help you introduce." Mobetter enthusiastically pointed his back to everyone. The prayers, "Pious Snoman monk, he believes in the creation of all the Lord, the omnipotent God, you don't care about him, he is completely enclosed in his belief world, but it is very reliable in battle. Companion, hey, I said Snowman, you say at least one sentence. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moutett did not respond and smiled and touched his chin道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the treatment I often suffer, you may have a hard time When I first entered here, I was still a proud, introverted, self-cultivating aristocrat, but the long time changed everything. Oh, when your companion is a giant who only knows smirk and shouts slogans..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said this, Grosell, sitting on a stone, smiled slyly and raised his hand and scratched his head, which was straight and single-eyed. There is no brutality and tyranny in the rumors of various giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobett shook his head and turned to the monk Snoman Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "and he probably will not say a word a few years more than a decade, Xia Tasi is a woman very violent, as long as there is a little emotional fluctuations, will beat my meal, hey, how much did I love her, Now, how much, forehead, afraid of her, so I can only talk actively and talk to them, otherwise I will definitely go crazy!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, Longzel came, he was still talkative, hey, Longzer, wake up, have a new companion! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleeping black armor slowly woke up and stared at Klein et al.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Suddenly, in the metal collision, he stood up and stared at Klein: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rouen? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Klein calmly nodded and found that the former Lun soldier who had been missing for more than 165 years was not old, his black hair was falling, his blue eyes were sharp, and he was unconscious and wanted to obey.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longzel has a clear embarrassment, but soon converges on the expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know the Edwardian family in Beckland? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beckland has a lot of Edward. Klein responded simply.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Living, living in the Edwardian family at 18 Dellahell Street, North West. "Longzel eagerly asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now There is no northwest area. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no northwest area..." Longzel whispered the other party's words, and the voice gradually became smaller.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was silent for a few seconds and breathed a sigh of relief:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how many years have passed outside, but it should have passed many years. Edwina told me the specific year, but I don't even remember which year I came in... I am sleeping most of the time, and the time here is like solidifying. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobate. Zoroastrian heard a chuckle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It's just that you are not lucky. When we walked through the city and the countryside, everything was fine. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked to Klein, Anderson, and Daniz: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" At that time, We live in places where there are human races, we marry again and again, and we look at our wives again and again, debilitating, and dying. Oh, before the new members join, we will forget the purpose, for decades and centuries. Living a normal but pleasant life, the only bad thing is that you can't have your own children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
