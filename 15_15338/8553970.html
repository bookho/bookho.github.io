			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain illusory feeling passed away, and Klein saw the strange candle in his hand and saw its dark candle and pale flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground that was shattered by the Dawn Knight, the ruined chair, and the broken candle returned to the state before the battle, and there is nowhere to see where it has been suffered. damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Utravsky bishop, who was originally standing opposite, did not know when he had sat in the chair of the first row, leaning forward and burying his head. Hold your temples on both sides with your hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweat slipped from his face and was soaked in the feet, where the ground was already wet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the strange candle has been annihilated by Klein, Uttraski slammed his head and raised his head in the other's gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His slightly sullen eyes are covered with tears, and the wrinkled faces are staggered with tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his eyes are feelings, joy, and clarification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the "giant" bishop was tall and heavy before, now he only has the weight of his body, no longer sinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Klein seems to have seen a newborn baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears are proof of new life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Uttraski’s mouth twitched a little, and smiled kindly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are much more powerful than I expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s just because I have enough understanding in advance, I’ve prepared for it, and the past Not only are you unclear what your opponent is good at, but you are also weakened a lot. If you are doing this kind of battle with you in the real world, I should consider how to escape." Kline replied calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prepared "magician" and the unprepared "magician" are completely different concepts... he silently added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Utravsky bishop did not get caught up in this problem, and he said with ease:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Thank you, my friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the agreement, I will give you the formula of 'pharmacist' and another magical item. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, he took out a combination of needles, hoses and containers from the pocket of the brown priest's suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have two choices, this is one of them. When I got it, I didn't know its name, and I didn't think about naming it later. You can use it to take out a tube of blood, your own blood, and wait until the critical moment, then go back in. As a result, your exhaustion will disappear, your disease and injury will be alleviated, your strength, speed, balance and other aspects. The quality will be shortened but greatly improved.” Bishop Utławsky pointed at the goods in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, what are its limitations and hidden dangers?" Klein asked sensibly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Utravsky looked at the needles and hoses with mysterious patterns, detailing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;" After you take out that tube of blood, you will be weak for twelve hours. The return within these twelve times will have no effect. Of course, the specific time limit is not so precise, according to the individual's constitution. And the state has increased or decreased. In addition, it is best not to use it frequently. Do not use it more than once a week. Otherwise, the blood that is returned will not only bring power, but will also make you lose your senses for a short time. The short interval of blood draw will also make you weak. Becoming your characteristic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Besides this, it has a problem, once you carry it for more than half an hour, you will become a little nervous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately, he frowned slightly and worried about the negative impact of the magical item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s a short-term loss of reason, a weakness of twelve hours, and a bit of nervousness, it’s a hidden danger that doesn’t seem to be a big problem, but I’ve seen it out of control. Klein, who has heard the evil spirits, believes that the spiritual state of the extraordinary is very important. If it runs for a long time in the valley, or if it is frequently abnormal, it will easily lead to the occurrence of out of control. Even if the extraordinary person masters the playing method, The same! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second choice?" Klein was silent for two seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Uttraski Bishop took out the quaint brass color key from another pocket and smiled:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's called 'Universal Key', it can help you open all locks that don't contain mysterious power, and a small number of locks with superb effects, and where there are no locks or no doors, it still Can open a channel that is not a reality, huh, huh, the premise is that there is no limit to extraordinary power, the obstacles are not too thick."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Its spirituality is completely restrained, When not in use, it is difficult for the extraordinary to see how it differs from the general key."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Uttraski stood up again, let Klein Can only choose to look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Giant" bishop stepped forward and came to the front of the wall on the side of the church hall, and put the "master key" on the masonry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently twisted, the whole person suddenly entered into the water, then swayed, penetrated the wall, and went outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Utravsky returned to the church hall in the same way and returned to Kline’s sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which magic item do you want to choose?" the tall priest bowed his head and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, what is the hidden danger of the 'universal key'?" Klein asked with a discretion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Uttraski Bishop is gentle and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person with it, occasionally Will get lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to others, it should be lost at random."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get lost ? I am a diviner, with a spiritual intuition... Klein sighed, and gradually decided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, he spoke:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want a 'master key'." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not want to have problems with his mental state and accumulates the risk of losing control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, what I want most is the strange candle... The deepest part of the soul, the bottom of the dream, is equivalent to my home... He sighed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Bishop Utravovsky handed the quaint brass key to Klein, in exchange for the human skin. Exotic candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Klein looked at the magical item, he pointed to the back:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pharmacist's The recipe is in the room, I am going to pick it up, you are waiting here for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded in response, the figure of Bishop Utravsky disappeared In the hall, I took out a 1 pence of copper coins and divination of whether the other person lied on the "universal key". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting a positive answer, he walked to the wall with a row of candles in front, putting the old brass key on the hard obstacle on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infused into the spirit, twisted the key, Klein's eyes suddenly stunned, and immediately became clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he no longer has burning candles in his sight, no more neat seats and straight walls, only withered hay and some rubbish Mud, sideways out, there is a gas street lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for another ten seconds, Uttraski came in heavily, holding a roll of yellow-brown parchment in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can go to the identification. If there is a problem, I am always in the harvest church." The "Giant" bishop handed the recipe of "pharmacist" to Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Main material: the angle of the adult one-horned Pegasus, the venom of the crown jellyfish crystallized 3 grams... Klein took a glance and responded with a smile: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will confirm the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, divination above the fog... he Add in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Uttrasky bishop gently decapitated, no longer speaks, and turned to the front of the earth goddess "life emblem". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretches his arms and sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, the source of life !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Commend you, the mother of all things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein put away the "master key" and "pharmacist" formula, after Utrechtski stopped, half jokingly said:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does my coming is the arrangement of Mother Earth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, what do you thank him for? Pseudo-night goddess Klein whispered in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, all this is the arrangement of the goddess, otherwise, the things I will find for help will not be passed to your ears, nor will I Will come to Beckland, will not harvest the 'heart candle'." Bishop Utravsky gently smiled, no anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete and self-consistent logic of believers, but... Klein suddenly felt that he could not communicate with each other, and he pressed his chest and took a ritual:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your generosity, I should say goodbye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He straightens his body, flies back, and quickly disappears The church hall disappeared into the rose flower street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten minutes later, he saw the golden façade of the Harvest Church again from another direction, and the corner of his mouth could not help but twitch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't go back without divination?" He said quietly, eager to rely on himself to overcome the lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his hand is faster than his voice, and he has broken the branches of the street tree and made a temporary wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bus Law" can not only find people, but also find things and find ways! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Klein finally returned home smoothly, and confirmed the true and false formula and the size of the "universal key" in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, that is, Sunday morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wake up, Klein used breakfast, took out a pen and paper, wrote a letter to Essinger Stanton, asked him to find help from the police department, confirm The current situation of several suspects in the serial killings four years ago - the goal was to be a prostitute with a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folding the letter paper and stuffing it into the envelope, Klein puts a black stamp of 1 pence denomination, puts on the clothes, holds the hat and cane, and walks out I have my own door, ready to go to the post of the postal delivery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw Mrs. Starling Summerer next door and Mr. Luke, who was dressed up, dressed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At their doorstep, they have parked a rental carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, go to dinner so early?" Klein asked a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
