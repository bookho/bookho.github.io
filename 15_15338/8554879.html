			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1,2,3,4,5...has the appearance of twelve pairs of wings... According to the description of the major church books, this is the highest order Angel..." Firth tried to recall the picture he saw during the half-dream and half-awake, and was shocked and not so shocked. It was like a shocking thing that he took for granted but had never been touched before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not surprising that Mr. Fool’s has an angel service. From “Mr. Justice” and “Down Man” occasionally use “He” to refer to It is imaginable that from the influence of He can isolate the full moon slang, it can be speculated... However, my request is only to interfere with Mr. Lawrence’s divination. He even directly let the angels bless me. This is too extravagant. ? Or is this a normal operation for him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount, there is still a question, why is the feather on the angel's wings black? Does this mean depravity or death? What is the true identity of Mr. Fool? What is the great existence? In the rumor, the "death" in the "Pale Age"? Will He resurrect himself through the Tarot gathering? Fols suddenly took a breath and no longer worried that the gentleman named Lawrence would use divination to find himself having problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought that she had joined the Tarot Club, and smiled a bit, silently whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only as Russell the Great said, take a step and take a step..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Converging the thoughts, Fols once again humbly thanked the "fool "Sir, then according to the normal process of the ceremony, the flames of the three candles were extinguished, and the altars filled with various objects were handled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, Klein temporarily tossed the Abraham family Got behind the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the original plan, he has a paper pen and writes the next divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The current situation in Daisy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting the pen in place, Klein stacked the vocabulary book of Daisy and the paper with the divination statement. Left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, leaning against the back of the chair, he entered the state of meditation and silently recited the "current situation of Daisy", over and over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seven full-times, Klein slept, and his eyes were dark and red, and then grayed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture will flash, some coherent, some jump, some have no logic before and after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw the little daughter of the pulping lady Liv, the 13-year-old girl who was repeatedly burned by steam but insisted on ironing clothes was worn by a heavy The jacket, the man wearing a gray cap, grabbed his mouth from behind with a handkerchief and forcibly dragged into the road of the lonely alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another man who did the same dress took her legs and lifted her up with her companion and walked fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal they are moving forward is the carriage that is parked outside the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process ended in less than two minutes, and when the sister of the West, Frye, returned to find it, the carriage had already left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the carriage, the sly thing was arrived by a cold and sharp dagger. Lived in the face, the ears are dirty and threatening words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage entered the luxury villa in Kapyeong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western is in a small, dark room, echoing from time to time Female crying, screams and curses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yixi wakes up and shouts for help, but is kicked open Overturned, it hurts to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shed tears and kept shouting words like "Mom" and "Freia". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein opened his eyes and found that the paper held in the left palm was not pinched and wrinkled into a ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has determined that Kapyeong is the leader of many girls’ disappearances and that he is the boss of a criminal group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the problem is that such a case should not and should not involve too much extraordinary power, at most there are several sequences 7 or sequences 8 that are greedy for money. Sequence 9 helps, and will not let Klein get close to the villa, and feel the danger through spiritual intuition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it that Cardin itself is a sequence 6, or even a sequence 5 extraordinary? It is not difficult for the extraordinary people at this level to make money. There is absolutely no need to do such dirty and cumbersome things. It is easy to find the gangs and collect the protection fees one by one. It is easier and harder than this. I have my own hand... Is there any hidden plot in the matter of trafficking in the population? Klein thought about it, and with the help of the power of the fog, the book of Kansai was restored to a flat and neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds of silence, he again showed a piece of parchment and wrote a new divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Saving things to Daisy is a dangerous thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking twice, Klein took off the left hand wrist and let the citrine The pendant hangs on the paper and touches the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calm for a few seconds, he closed his eyes and meditated on the divination statement he had just written. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sound stopped, Klein opened his eyes and looked at the left hand grip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citrine pendant is doing a clockwise rotation, the speed is quite fast, the amplitude is quite large! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is affirmative, indicating that saving Daisy is a very dangerous thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is not completely desperate, there is still no small possibility, no small opportunity, as long as it can be grasped... Klein interprets the "spiritual spell" Give inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned back on the back of his chair, closed his eyes and laughed at himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking for an opportunity to take the initiative?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a magician, you still have to challenge a bit of a difficult thing, otherwise you should call a master of tricks, not a magician.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete seemingly impossible things, even if the results are false, this is the image of the magician in my heart, as to whether it is one of the codes, to be confirmed..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kline fingers tapped the edge of the ancient long table and made a quick decision.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save the West For him, the most difficult thing for him is that he is completely ignorant of the other party. He does not know which of the extraordinary people in the villa belong to which route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Klein unable to make targeted preparations.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for "Magic", first The code is, “Do not make unprepared performances!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Many impromptu performances are actually prepared For example, long-term practice exercises, for example, in-depth grasp of the attention.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of the prostitute, let the 'justice' help the card Flat background? Klein seriously considered the solution to the problem.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he quickly denied the idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No, this does not get detailed information. Although Kaping is a rich man who is involved with many big people, he can't always get on the table. At least, Miss Justice can find out which aristocrats and which government employees are related to him. It’s shallow, but I can’t figure out how many extraordinary people in his villa, what traps are laid out, how is the pattern...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“These clues along these relationships, Miss 'Justice' may be able to find out what I want to know in a few weeks, but it is too slow, saving people is like a firefighting, and a tragedy will occur when a delay occurs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's gaze swept over the surface of the bronze long table, sweeping through the corners of the pile of debris, and gradually got the idea of ​​forming:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss 'Miss and her friend Miss Hugh investigate the background of Ka Ping, to figure out what other people he is involved with, they are in the Eastern District, in many gangs, in many extraordinary circles, have a good network, on the other hand, I did it myself, and I got the information I wanted from the servants or bodyguards who came out of the Kaping villa, using the 'passenger' way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finalization of the plan, Klein was not in a hurry to let the "Magician" help, decided to try it first, so that she could specifically inquire about certain things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, his figure disappeared into the palace above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After lunch, a gray cap and a thick cotton coat The man, carefully left from the back door of Kaping Villa, went all the way to the crossroads and boarded a rental carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"East District." He touched the dark red birthmark on his face and told the driver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage started to drive, the man looked bored at the window and admired the beautiful lady and lady on the street dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can tie them away, you will be fine..." The man floated his imagination and showed a regretful expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After staying at Ayers Street, he suddenly made a nap and his eyes became slightly demented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked on the wall and said to the coachman:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop, stop! I If you forget something, you are here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver didn’t dare to blame the fierce man, even if he didn’t even mutter the carriage on the street, let alone He got off the bus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After paying 6 pence, the man went back a few tens of meters and entered a cheap hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a proof of identity, he saved money and opened a room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering, he just slammed the door and did not lock it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, the man sat facelessly on the edge of the bed, and suddenly separated a transparent and illusory figure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Klein who is dressed as a worker! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used his own way of summoning himself to become a spirit, attached to this man, and let him go to a place where it is convenient to "psychic"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After stunned the man, the spirit of Klein disappeared into the room, not long after, the door was pushed open, his flesh and blood was solid Going back again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blocked with a spiritual wall, Klein quickly arranged a "psychic" ceremony, let "Amanda" pure dew, "Eye of the Eyes" potion empty The fascinating taste is floating around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be prepared, he is about to start "Psychic" and suddenly snorted and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that the man’s body stunned in bed was subject to mysterious unknowns, and if he forced “psychic”, although the probability would be successful, But it will touch the imprint and let an extraordinary person notice it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be a surprise! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very strange extraordinary ability... very cautious, very careful... the things involved in Kaping are really not easy... Kline took a few steps, brows Slightly wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the unconscious man and suddenly snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You thought this Can you live with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly interrupted the psychic ritual, once again summoned himself and responded to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, the spirit-like one flew out of the candlelight and floated again in this room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
