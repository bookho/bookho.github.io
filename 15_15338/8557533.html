			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Greman. Sparo put on his coat, put on his hat, and lifted his cane, and Daniz remembered that he seemed to be forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coughed and looked at the two eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I need Go with it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s best not to...who knows what will happen! It was only after the suspension of Westport, but it was a rather strange event. Last night, with Gelman Sparrow to visit the Rebel liaison, the result was the curse of "Poseidon". Today, follow this madman to investigate. Several archaeologists in Laticia, who knows what will happen again! Daniz looked down and attached the left arm of the splint. In just a few days, he encountered more than a few months or even half a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can stay here, but someone will check it out later." Elland laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone to troubleshoot? Then the big pirate "flame" was arrested and turned into a golden pound? Daniz frowned and smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to taking a reward, there are not many opportunities to make money from the military. I am very happy to give it a try." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The only problem is that you have to wait a few minutes, I am doing some disguise, Mr. Captain, I don't want to cause unnecessary misunderstandings, which makes you embarrassed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't disguise, my big pirate will go to work with the military and the church, and will only be tripped on the spot, arrested and brought to justice... Dani Imagine a scene where you are directly flipped, knees back, and can only struggle like a squid.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erland recalls a few seconds from clothing The inner pocket has an iron-black mask thrown over the past:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s okay to wear it, and I will explain the rest. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, there is no need to waste time doing a little disguise... Klein has evaluated it in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not speak, twisted the handle and walked out of the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan was close behind, taking an iron mask and taking the coat Daniz rushed to catch up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the street where there is more water and no passers-by, Klein pressed the hat:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to find? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erland smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sub-regional troubleshooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My extraordinary profession has some characteristics, as long as I have seen a real person, a photo or a sketch, I can remember the way the target looks and get extra on the extraordinary level. Induction, um, I can still detect abnormal factors and grasp the obvious signs. When the two are combined, they can be checked quite effectively."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sequence of the "arbitrator" route 8 "Sheriff"... Klein nodded thoughtfully and asked while walking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are their "Items?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Last night, Daniz posted a portrait with a portrait of Latsia, which is Klein using ritual magic to himself. Prayer is done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Elland shook his head. "There has not been able to grasp their whereabouts before. It can be confirmed that they were only from around 3:00 pm yesterday. The island returned, and after two o'clock, there was no passenger liner leaving the port. This morning, due to the weather, it was only inaccessible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Latsia Waiting for someone to leave by boat... Klein understood what Elland meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz suddenly laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can’t explain anything, maybe they were yesterday In the afternoon, I left Baiam and went to other cities on the island.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue Mountain Island is the largest island in the Rhodes Islands, with a large area, forest and mineral resources. Rich, so there are many cities on the island that are built around fertile land and amazing reserves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these wealth, the kingdom of Luen first bribed the indigenous princes, then forced by force, and finally directly established the Governor's Office, in a more efficient way to open up the broad roads connecting the cities, and completed several important railways - this is to set up The corresponding railway company, in the form of the sale of shares raised on the Beckland Stock Exchange, was promoted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these big projects are accompanied by the deaths of many locals, the sinister construction environment, the overworked work, the treatment of almost slaves, and the rather meager salary. Let the roadbed and the railway sleepers bury one body after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, a large number of locals still hate the railway, thinking that it has swallowed up a lot of human lives, brought countless sufferings, is a symbol of evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erland looked at Daniz sideways: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If they are from land If you leave, you don't need to worry about anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Daniz asked inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very simple, those roads pass through the jungle and are directly threatened by the Rebels, and the majority of the Rebels belong to the “Poseidon” believers, so the card How can Lattia and others who will disintegrate in Vituto go through these areas at night? If they dare, they can only explain one problem. They don’t realize what serious consequences they will do in the remains of the “Poseidon” in the island of Symi, which negates the “Moss accompaniment” or “ "Dawn of Elements" has another plot of speculation... Klein took control of the urge to shake his head and followed Elland into another street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan has not explained anything, just took out a notice and handed it to German Sparrow:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main goal is the woman above."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman above is my painting... Klein glanced at it and threw it at it. Daniz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, they heard a fierce fighting in the side house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found?" Daniz asked out what Klein wanted to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should not." Elland shook his head. "According to the arrangement, after discovering the main target, the first reaction was to release red fireworks, as long as this appeared. In the situation, everyone must move closer to that place. If they encounter other wanted criminals and belong to the type that they cannot cope with, put orange fireworks, and several groups around will rush to support. If they are only ordinary pirates, criminals, handle them by themselves. We wait and see, maybe it’s too late to put fireworks...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talks, the third floor of the street house, the glass is broken, a giant bear like The brawny jumped down, very fast, like a cheetah rushing to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, a huge shadow shrouded him, and the sound of snoring came from high altitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the strong man was almost torn by machine gun bullets, fell on the street without resistance, blood flowed out, reddened, if It is not the residents who are forbidden to go out, there will be screams that will scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when the floating airship floated away without stopping, turning to another position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Gortat." Daniz identified who the deceased was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Greman Spalo looking sideways, he forcibly laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the leader of a pirate group, the Visaks, who have a bounty of 950 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fossacks...severy they are barbarians...even This runs on the streets of martial law, completely unaware of the attack on the top of the head... Also, these pirates just drunk and dreamed of a night, and they didn’t even know that even the airships were dispatched... If he planned to escape the route, he might not be able to escape. The airgun fired... Klein retracted his gaze and watched the dark blue painted air monster fly over the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz saw the pirate's end, and was extraordinarily glad to follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayrlan sees the alarm here, no longer stays, leads Klein and Daniz, and turns to the area where he will be responsible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After walking for five or six minutes, they saw a barricade at the intersection ahead, set up guns, set up artillery, and a red dress. The soldiers kept there silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the barricade, twenty or thirty bodies were messed up on the ground, forming a formation that was charged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are tattered and their faces are thin and they are all local people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little further away, several young indigenous children are hiding in the corner, looking at the quiet and cringing, looking at the deep muzzle The eyes are black and the face is dirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and others silenced for a few seconds and bypassed the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Jowood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls picked up the ceramic cup on the table and felt a little hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gathers her spirits and waits for change quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature of the hot water drops rapidly, the surface of the liquid condenses a thin layer of ice, and the edge of the cup has hoarfrost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a 'master of tricks'..." Fols closed his eyes with delight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no delay in receiving the stomach bag of the spirits, and immediately assigned the potion, completed the promotion, and gained a lot of less powerful spell-like ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, Fols's favorite are "fog", "wind", "flash", "ice", "shock" and people's feet Slip "fall". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this moment, she felt that she was a complete extraordinary person, no longer only open the door through the wall, no longer have to rely on ritual magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near noon, Allan in Klein and Daniz With the assistance, most of the troubleshooting work was completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop the bread, drink some water, and continue." He took off the boat cap and said dry lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was at the head, and suddenly saw an orange fireworks not far away in the air, blooming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erland barely hesitated, immediately put on his hat and ran in that direction:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I will support in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Orange means there are other wanted criminals who can't be dealt with... Who is it?" Daniz is interested in talking to himself. Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He switched to a high-legged posture, so that he would arrive at the end of the battle, then he saw that Greman Spalo threw himself, followed by justice. Elland is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aiming at the "dark blue monster" flying in the air, Daniz laughed twice and slammed his footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than two minutes, they arrived at the target location and saw a house with a street lawn, and three or four military personnel were on the back. Blue, body trembled, seems to have been thrown into the frozen lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the Klein goes in that direction, the more he experiences the cold, the feeling of coming to the polar,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Soon, he found that the ditch outside the house was full of thick white snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a burst of female laughter suddenly appeared in the house, when the time was high and low, when it was crazy, it was strange:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Giggle...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ha ha ha...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Giggle..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz could not help but stop In the next step, I touched the neck of the layer with my right hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, the window opened and a blackened body flew out.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell heavily on the ground like a fire.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
