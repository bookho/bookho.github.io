			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the door is a naked man with a blue-blue sea snake on his arms, red paint on both sides of his cheeks and on his chest. The short stripes are smeared in groups of three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really exotic...but don’t be too conspicuous, is it blocked by the police when you go out? You are the rebel army of hidden activities! Klein had just to look back, but he was almost frowned by the other's thick eyebrows and cold-blooded eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Killed a lot of people... Klein made a rough judgment with his spiritual intuition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, because of his identity and cognition in his life, he initially had great sympathy for the rebel against colonial rule, without the consciousness of the Lun people. However, after hearing that the other party and the "Poseidon" Cavitowa believers almost overlap, the heart has become more alert and repelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that it discriminates against local beliefs, but that he understands that the traditional beliefs of all colonial islands remain at the stage of primitive sacrifices, advocating blood food and advocating living sacrifices. It is in a state of considerable obscurity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, with the experience of the Emperor and my own experience, the extraordinary essence of this world is the "spirit" of the elements of madness and distortion, still in the original sacrifice It is almost impossible to fight against this trend, the style can be imagined... Klein did not speak, followed Daniz's side and walked into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Edmonton, who is here?" An alcoholic voice came from the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tattoo men said at the door:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They made a disguise."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein had a panoramic view of the room and had a preliminary grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living room here is not big, and it is already cramped to put a cupboard, a table and a few chairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two doors on the right that lead to the suspected bedroom. On the left is the "kitchen" separated by a cabinet. As for the bathroom, there is no doubt that there is no When Klein went upstairs, he found that there was a public washroom at the corner of each corner of the stairs. The smell that had not been cleaned for a long time was filled, prompting pedestrians to go upstairs as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a window in front of it, two bamboo poles are spending outside, drying a lot of clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "bedroom" door and the living room or standing or sitting four or five men, are dark-skinned, black-haired, local people, they set With a dark blue Tara shirt, more or less red paint is applied to the exposed skin. As for the sea snake tattoo, Kline cannot see if there is any clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have a waist-left revolver, some with a brown-red shotgun, some even carrying a gray-white steel backpack, holding a thick high pressure The steam rifle formed a semi-enclosed situation for the entry-level Daniz and Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who just asked was a man sitting in an iron wheelchair, in his forties, with a blanket on his knees and a jacket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shaved his bald head, with a blue beard on both sides of his cheeks, and the dark brown eyes were restrained and unfettered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the visitor and smiled slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"flame."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz stunned and forcibly laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Karate, your eyesight is really good ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dog! Is my makeup dressing technique really so bad? He did not want to accept a roar in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karate ignored the "flame" and did not sincerely praise, and turned to laugh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I heard that you killed 'Steel' and 'Bloody Thorns'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How else would they die?" Daniz did not hesitate Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very clear, only by "flame" Daniz, not to mention "steel" Maviti, even "Bloody Thorns" Huntley is difficult to kill, the other party can succeed, the rumor is to get a strong adventurer The help of experienced bounty hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this next to him? Karat looked at Klein's eyes and found no tension, worry, vigilance, etc. The scorpions were like a deep ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probably... at least stronger than "flame"! He gave a look to Edmonton and others, and secretly increased his alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" Karat did not entangle the topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi glanced at Klein and replied after seeing the affirmative dagger:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Look at what good things you have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karat points to the table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Everything is above.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of strange things, including whistle made of bones, simple and rough bagpipes, and iron-black leaves. The stone with blood...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the examination of Klein and Daniz, Karat took the hand:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a task.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can finish it, you are free to pick an item from here, no need to pay Any price. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the definition of your foreigners, They are not magical items, but they all have supernatural powers, but they will slowly, um, not too slow to weaken until they disappear. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What mission? Klein calmly asked, not to hide the fact that Daniz was just a follower.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karate put his hand into the blanket on his knee and took it out. A stack of white paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Find their whereabouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can catch it directly, you will get more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted the double Arms, began to show a portrait of a lifelike portrait, including a woman with a gray eye and a male shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Latticia. Dorri... Klein recognizes who the Rebels are looking for at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the female archaeologist, adventurer who met with the ship this morning, suspected to be a member of the Morse Mind Society or Elemental Dawn . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz looked at it for two seconds and was vaguely familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he recalled where he had seen:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German next to him. Sparo showed it in his dreams! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked the captain in the afternoon and met the relevant incident at night... This ability to collect intelligence is too strong, right? Daniz resisted the urge to go to the crazy adventurer next to him, fearing that they were found abnormal by Karat and Edmonton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, he is still very experienced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rebels of the "Poseidon" are looking for Latsia... The belief in "Poseidon" extends throughout the Rothde Islands, including Simim... ... The image of "Poseidon" is a huge sea snake... Klein overlaps two things and quickly has a preliminary judgment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An archaeologist Latsia and others took an important item involving the "Poseidon" in the forgotten temple in the original jungle of Syma, so they had the temptation of last night and the search for the Rebel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will pay attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not mix this evil-related thing, of course, if necessary, I will report...he In the heart silently added two sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carla features nodded words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You first see what you want." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walked over and was about to ask and ask, and there was a sense in his heart, and the subconscious looked to the right side of the pile of items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a short sword made of slender bones, slightly longer than the small arm, all white, with several dark red deep markings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can touch my inspiration... Klein stretched out his right hand and tried to pick up the sharp bone sword at the front end and check it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His finger just touched the bone sword, and suddenly there was a cry of desperation and pain in his mind, and the nose showed a strong stock. The blood is stinky, and it seems as if you have seen a twisted, rotten, imaginary figure wrapped in mucus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had a pain in his forehead, and if he was acupuncture, he subconsciously retracted his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bit sinister...not a simple item... Klein’s expression with a more intense experience has only changed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He resisted the urge to open "Lingshi" and was afraid to see things that should not be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noticing this scene, Karat and Edmonton looked at each other with a smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This bone sword can suck the enemy's blood, it's not bad, want it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little active...Klein micro frown The head, then stretched, then said in a deep voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, there is nothing I want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp If Karat doesn't ask, he intends to buy the bone sword and get it on the fog, but the other party's act of selling is a little vigilant, so he gave up the original plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karate is holding hands and hands:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not expensive.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or look at the rest? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. "Klein's pupil swelled and turned directly to the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz hesitated and hurry up.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edmonton with a sea snake tattoo looks silent and seems to be reaching out at any time, but in the end no action has been taken.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp That is a powerful adventurer who killed the "steel" Maviati, "Bloody Thorns" Huntley and others!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the room, Klein does not send In a word, when he went downstairs, Daniz rushed to catch up, and he was inexplicably scared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He distinguished the situation, did not ask, just followed.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two quickly returned to the square, and the crowds who gathered again or bowed or squatted again and again to evade.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But unlike before, there is a man who is still in the same place and has no movement.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein does not squint, passes directly, does not stop at all.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs d; Daniz looked at it subconsciously and found that the man's face was like a rock that had been weathered for a long time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪!<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s cheeks have a piece of meat that suddenly falls off, with a bearded skin, falling on the ground, and the color is gray.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
