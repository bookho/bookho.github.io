			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the complete disappearance of the star-studded body, Jia Delia lowered her head, and Frank Lidao, who had just slowed down:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let them calm down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This refers to the sailors who are still struggling with pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, Jia De Li Ya retracted back and the window closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Klein vaguely saw a blue-green vine growing up from below, wrapping the "star above" layer by layer. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no danger or evil, he intuitively believes that this is the occult method for Ms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability of her extraordinary path? Or is it a magic item she has? She was so relieved to start treatment, and let Frank deal with the chaos on the ship, is not worried about the "death" catch up? How far has the "Future" finally flew? Klein no longer raised his neck and turned to look at Frank Lee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the toxin expert and the chief mate of the powerful doctor. He has taken a entangled hose from his bib pocket and it is connected at the side. A small glass bottle with a slender, sharp needle on one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have prepared an injection-type sedative." Frank Lee was scared after leaving it, and some smiled reluctantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bought similar items and gave them to the "living body" Maric... Klein looked around:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is probably not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, not for them, I have to find a helper first. They have a calming effect. The beer helps, haha, they are always noisy once they get drunk, so I added the necessary elements to most of the barrels," Frank explained casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no word for the medicine... Kline’s mouth is almost twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he finally realized that the title of "toxin expert" is worthy of the name:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just because The pirates were drunk and very noisy. Frank put most of the alcoholic beverages with modified sedatives, and they didn't feel guilty. They didn't feel guilty at all. It seemed that they just did something very normal and normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is a blunt good man in some respects, but also scary in other ways than a demon, because he doesn’t feel that he is doing what he is doing. "Evil"... How did the Mother Earth Church raise this "mad scientist"? Klein controlled his expression and followed Frank Lee for a distance and found the sailor, Nina, who was wriggling in the shadow of the bulkhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exaggerated pirate was there, painfully twisted, her hands constantly scratching on the deck, grabbing the harsh, harsh, squeaky voice. Grabbed a trace of clear blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only seeing such a picture, Klein felt his fingers hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German, help me, hold me down and let her not struggle." Frank raised his needle and hose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not refuse, but did not speak, calmly squatted to the side, reaching for Nina's shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just touched the other side, he felt his hands slipping, difficult to grasp, it seems that the target is not a lady, but a giant fish full of slippery scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein instantly adjusted, with the help of the "clown" precision control, grabbed Nina's shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the strength of the other side is extremely great, better than Klein, and soon made his fingers soft and sore, difficult to maintain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a sequence of “sailors”, and I’m not an extraordinary person who is good at power... If you don’t need to feed, this time turns on “squirming hunger” Switching to the soul of "Steel" Maviti, using the power of "live corpse" is the most appropriate and appropriate... When the thoughts flash, Klein saw Frank come together and kneel down, pressing his knees on Nina's On the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His muscles bulged and quickly stopped Nina's struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the "cultivator" approach to the extraordinary is not small... However, Mr. Frank Lee, treating this woman with this rude method, you are very afraid It’s hard to have a girlfriend... Of course, you’re not too concerned about it. You can let your child grow out of the soil... Klein spoke a few words and watched Frank Lee insert the needle into Nina’s back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the push of the vial of sedative, Nina no longer struggled, and Klein loosened her hands and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, Nina leaned over her hair and stood up and complained to Frank Lee, who was next to him:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you always rude like a bear? Can't you change the way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She spoke hands, no Cover the painful expression on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the time of deep dive, she is now wearing a linen shirt and a brown coat, which looks very different from ordinary pirates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank did not care about Nina’s complaints, and asked questions:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where am I rude? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, let's not argue about this issue, help them first." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go out and bring the barrels out, we cooperate to give them a drink.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Man, don't you mind participating in this matter? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at the sailors who fell to the ground on the deck and thought for two seconds, and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The purpose is to calm them down? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "Frank Lee focuses on the head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I stun them directly?" Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be similar to the effect of calming wine, and more efficient... He added a sentence in his heart.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nina looked sideways and looked at German Sparrow, who couldn’t speak for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Frank Lee seriously thought: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. Klein went to a long knife that had long been locked, picked it up and knocked it on the head of his master with a knife.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his precise control, the painful pirate calmed down and lost consciousness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina expression slightly I watched for a second and then returned to normal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She then passed by Klein, slowed down, and lowered her voice and laughed:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have heard your rumors, but I didn't expect you to be more exaggerated than the rumors. Under normal circumstances, it should be the opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... your thinking is very, very strange, completely different from us, very close to Frank, this may be that he will treat you as a friend in a short time. The reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the madman and the madman are also different, and Greman Spalo has not yet reached the level of Frank... Klein calmly examined, A reply was given in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not pay attention to Lina, carrying the long knife, walking on the deck, stunned the sailors one by one, waiting for them to wake up naturally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank wanted to imitate him, but Nina asked, "Do you have the confidence to only stun and not kill them?", give up the impulse and enter the cabin. Move out of the barrel and follow the original plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein knocked all the way to the front of the deck, when a fifty-year-old man wearing a pointed bonnet had initially eased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
