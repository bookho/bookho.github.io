			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death knell? Every shot is a death knell for the enemy? I like this name... Klein controls his facial expressions, and he doesn’t look forward to it with excitement and excitement. He reaches for the iron-black revolver with a slightly longer barrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very worried that he would show a very wanted will, and he would be temporarily raised by the other party. This is a common thing in buying and selling. Mann Sparo is already famous, and Anderson is the strongest hunter in the foggy sea. Okefa Conakris, although he may have been the strongest of the sequence 5, has already withdrawn from the adventurer circle and only thought about it. A stable life, certainly not afraid to offend yourself, afraid of crazy adventurers do not attack face to face, and turned back into the manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, his efforts to maintain a dull attitude have become a purely maintenance need. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Greman. Sparo is carefully examining and studying the "the death knell", Oak Law describes in detail:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's actually a very simple ability to harvest other people's lives. There are three ways:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One is a weak point attack, You don't need to open the conditions, you can directly infuse the spirit, and you can use the trigger. It can let you discover the weakness of the target from the occult point of view, that is, the weak place of defense, and provide the corresponding precision, thus causing terrible damage beyond normal; Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second is a fatal attack, you must use a hammer before the shooting to use, it is characterized by, regardless of where you hit the target, it is equivalent Attack on the weak point, and if you really hit the real weakness, then the enemy is not too strong defense, you can do a shot deadly, for the target of good defense, can be solved within three guns, including the 'guardian', of course , provided that the interval between three hits is not too long, preferably no more than 5 seconds <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The third is the 'killing', which provides more than double the spirituality on the basis of the weak point attack, which can make the normal bullet produce a shotgun effect while attacking the gun. A large number of enemies in the direction of the mouth are range-killing. If you want to increase the damage level, you will provide more than twice the spirituality on the basis of the deadly attack, which is no small burden for the user. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can also work with bullets of different characteristics for different types of enemies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It sounds like the sequence of the "hunter" route 5 "Reaper"... Klein took a look at Anderson next to her eyes and asked thoughtfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the target is a dragon with a physical strength reaching sequence 4, how many guns can a fatal attack kill?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okfa stunned for a second, some sluggish Shake his head and shake his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never encountered a dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention A dragon with a half-god level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German. Sparo wants to take this gun to the dragon? Or a semi-god dragon? Is this going crazy? Oak Law suddenly feels that the current adventurer is completely different from his active one, and he does not consider whether he will die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson coughed twice and cleared his throat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It depends on luck, Really, believe me, luck is very important!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you encounter a dragon that has been beaten to death by someone else, then you can shoot Solve, if not, my suggestion is to run away, um, living is more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, if the semi-god dragon does not defend, stand and let you play, then a five-gun deadly attack should be able to kill it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okfa looked at Anderson and looked at German Sparrow and decided not to continue the topic. He turned to say:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anderson told you about the negative effects of 'the death knell'? After each use, you will get a weakness that does not exist, or strengthen the existing weaknesses, let It has become more extreme. This effect will last for 6 hours. Once, I became very afraid of dogs, so that I just hunted the famous pirates, in front of a kitten that was not long before, legs Soft, stumbled to the ground, shouted for help, crying for mercy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you just carry it, the problem is not big, just thirst, drink plenty of water to wash The room can be solved. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always feel that the negative impact of one more weakness will make a lot of accidents... but it is relatively affordable. Klein considered the following: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;""Price"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "9000 pounds, Anderson should have mentioned, this is my reserve price." Oak Law looked at German. Spa "The death knell" in the hands of Luo, "This is already cheap enough. If it is not for me that I know that more extraordinary people will have a bad influence on my current life and actively promote it, the 12,000 pounds will definitely be sold. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, this level of magical items, as long as the negative effects are not too serious, encountering the right buyer, it is likely to sell the sky price... normal For example, 10,000 to 12,000 pounds is reasonable... Although Kline has the heart to pay a price, but the price given by the other party is so low that he is a little embarrassed and then take advantage of it, 遂 "Hm" a voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I try, if there is no problem, I will deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He certainly does not want to really test the gun, which will make him have a weakness in his own voice. His method is to use spiritual exploration to combine divination and lie detection to check. He is quite calm and does not care at all. Oak Law and Anderson's gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fog, make a confirmation... However, Oak Law should not dare to lie to me, he must be afraid of revenge after crazy adventures. After all, he has returned to a calm and peaceful life, with his wife and children... Klein put the "cancel the knell" on the table, lifted the suitcase, and took out the pre-existing from the fog to the real world. 9000 pounds of huge money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okfa took the money and quickly counted it, initially confirming the true and false and the total amount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the most famous adventurer recently, and it’s not uncommon for people to get 9000 pounds of cash at a time. Even some rich people don’t have so much liquidity. "He folded the banknotes in a stack, and he said with sincerity." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also spent 5,000 pounds to buy the key... Klein looked at the 9,000-pound banknote into the drawer of Oak Law, and suddenly there was a emptiness in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been tossing at sea for so long, and I have lost so much money, and the result is gone in a short time... now there are only 2,683 pounds and 6 gold coins. Even a slightly better manor can't afford it... Klein is inexplicable, taking out the ordinary revolver from the gun bag, taking out the bullet inside, and stuffing it into the "the death knell." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson watched the whole process of the transaction, saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oakfa, you have changed You used to check the authenticity of the banknotes one by one. If you are in trouble, I can help!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem at all, but I am worried about Geer Man will give you a shot." Oak Law obviously knows the provocative talent of the strongest hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point of banknotes, verifying the authenticity of the light, slow movements, low posture, is a picture he can imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s right! Klein silently agreed to put the iron black long tube revolver into the armpit gun bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original one was thrown into the trunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your generosity so that I don't have to worry about this matter anymore." Oak Law smiled and pointed to the door. "I let my servant send it." You are leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson opened his mouth and snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oakfa, Don't you leave us for dinner?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“When you get married, with children, I invite you to share the food in the most luxurious restaurant.” Oak Law I didn’t care about my companion’s accusation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the manor, Anderson blinked his head and looked at the sun that was about to fall, chuckling a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I met Oak Law, he was just a doctor who was good at planting strange plants on the boat to improve everyone's life. I thought he would die early in adventure. I didn't expect him to be lucky. Yes, it turned out to be a 'druid'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are you swearing words, and so blame... Klein deliberately said:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
