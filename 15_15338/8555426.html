			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about the possibility of the demon dog owner, Klein immediately changed his strategy and met himself with Essinger Stanton in a series of murders. Tell it again. In addition, he also voluntarily mentioned that Essinger Stanton organized a group of detectives to investigate serial killings and successfully obtained some rewards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In that commission, I just gave some thoughts, um, in the terminology of the private detective industry, it provides advice. But Mr. Stanton still believes that he has contributed the most, so I got the most bounty.” Klein concluded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two police officers responsible for the trial brushed the situation and asked if anyone could prove the above. Klein gave Stuart, card The name and address of the private detective such as Slana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good, Mr. Moriarty, your answer is detailed enough." A police officer stopped the pen and asked, "You are in Ai today. How long did Singer Stanton’s family stay? I mean from entering to being discovered by us.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it, did not consult Jurgen The lawyer’s opinion directly replied: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two to three minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He It is a true personal feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another police officer raised his eyebrows:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few residents nearby can confirm that you are in the afternoon At about two o'clock, I entered the home of Essinger Stanton, and we arrived at the scene at 2:28 pm, which means that you stayed in the house for about 18 minutes instead of two to three minutes. !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing for such a long time? Why not leave without an alarm? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After eighteen minutes? Klein Horan frowned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt I and the silent look at the stalemate for at least a minute, how did it go for 18 minutes?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the kind of strange feeling that is being pegged Is my grasp of time, or something else? Is this the extraordinary ability of the other party? If it is the owner of the devil dog, he has at least a sequence of 6, a high probability sequence 5... Klein doubts and contemplates, before Jurgen’s body Pour, ready to accuse the police of allegedly induced.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a very good reason, he just wants to interrupt the trial rhythm in this way, so that the obvious is not good The problem has been delayed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Klein raised his hand and licked the forehead:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "All that I said was true. In my personal sense, I entered the house of Essinger Stanton's detective for only two to three minutes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said here, he emphasized:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, in my personal feelings . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two police officers looked at each other and recorded this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short silence Later, the police officer who had just asked the question said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In that eighteen minutes, a servant who came out from the door rang the doorbell, and no one answered, so he I glanced inside through the convex belly window and saw the dead body and the standing at the door of the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was very scared and ran to the police station to report the case. Many passers-by and some residents can confirm this."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein ignored the eyes of Mr. Ergen’s lawyer and shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't hear the doorbell ringing." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two police officers looked at each other again without making any comment, just a mere record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, he couldn't help but care about one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a detective of Essinger Stanton? I see no body in the living room, he should still be alive.吧..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A police officer slammed the desk with a pen:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also We are very puzzled. The whole house has only traces of fighting in the living room, and the windows are closed. It has not been opened for many days. You know, this is normal in the autumn and winter of Beckland.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The attacker and Mr. Essinger Stanton left the room strangely. I don’t know where I went. We didn’t find any clues or even blood spots in other parts of the house and around. Did not find. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for Klein to speak, he asked himself: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You definitely want to say The living room door and the house door, however, many people confirmed that there was no chasing in the vicinity, and no one took the hostage or left with the body. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe the real thing happened in the middle of the night? Maybe they will wear the wall? Klein silently offered other possibilities in his heart, silently praying :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May the goddess protect the Essinger Stanton detective from escaping.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The goddess is the queen of embarrassment and fear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the trial, Klein was copied to a small room, and the police department sent someone to follow the lawyer of Jurgen to Minsk. On the 15th of the street, the letter was taken out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been tossed until late in the evening, and Klein was finally allowed to bail for £50.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is much more expensive than last time. It is very difficult for a typical private detective to take out so much cash in a short period of time. "Out of the gate of the Chisak police station, Klein got together and made a coat collar, complaining to Mr. Ergen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgen is still there The subprofessional expression: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The last time was good for you, and this time many doubts point to you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He greeted the rental carriage and stopped, looking at Klein seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Sherlock, I am your lawyer. Before you answer the police question, it is best to have some communication with me, even if it is just a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not feel free to think that you have no problem, ordinary people who are not trained can easily leave a handle on the words."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... I’m used to making my own story and solving the problem myself... Klein recalled just now, and laughed twice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, I will pay attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgen did not say more, boarded the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat across from him and thought about the attack on Essinger Stanton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, he suddenly heard the snoring of his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been half an hour after normal dinner... Klein took out the gold-shelled pocket watch and glanced at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t plan to waste his energy preparing food and start thinking about which restaurant to look forward to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Jurgen raised his eyelids:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have made my grandma Prepare a three-person dinner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this fun?" Klein snorted and smiled. "Mrs. Doris's craftsmanship always makes People yearn for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the lawyer's house, Mr. Gengen had a dinner. After smashing the cat, Klein stepped back into the house on the 15th in the cold and humid air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He habitually turned over the letter box and took out a "Beckland Evening News" that had just been sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the newspaper, opened the door and entered the house, just put the cane, suddenly felt a bit wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His divination spiritual instinct tells him that strangers have entered their homes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the police who have previously obtained evidence? Klein was wary and suddenly found a letter on the coffee table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be only newspapers there! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein always guards the attack into the living room, closes the coffee table, and the whole process is quiet and silent, without any exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at the letter, Klein took out the black gloves and then picked it up and removed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the envelope is a thin piece of stationery. Immediately after the explosion, the dark red color is reflected in Klein’s eyes, and the faint bloody smell is lingering. His nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the letter, the solidified blood is written with a line of words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going to die! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...is the owner of the devil's dog? Is he retaliating against the people involved in his death? It’s really bullying and hard, how can you not directly find the strong night actor who is responsible for clearing the action? Klein was in a tight heart and flashed a lot of thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he quickly denied his complaint. Revenge is the most normal choice from the person who can deal with it. Just like he came to Beckland for a few months, he never thought about finding Inz. Zangweier, but he was chasing Lalhous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking around again, Klein gradually felt that this thing was a bit confusing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Revenge in such a public manner, not afraid to be guarded by the official strong? This is his potion play request?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Or, because Essinger. Stanton's detective escaped. He knew that he could not cover the target one by one. He could only change the way, but this method did not make sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, at the time of the Stanton detective, he clearly locked me, always watching me, why not do it? He would still care about me. An ordinary private detective?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is impossible...he knows that I am extraordinary?" It is possible that I have directly touched the devil's dog because of the lost side effect of the master key. It has seen my appearance and body shape. Although I did some camouflage at the time, I don't know if the 'demon' can see through this... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, after that thing, it can be presented to its owner in some way...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "But, I didn't even win the devil's dog at the time, I could only escape, what good is he?" Unless he still cares about other things, such as Essinger Stanton hidden in the vicinity because of the injury? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He wrote to me very arrogantly, is that I am afraid that I am not afraid to seek official help?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein checked the house with his full questions and went all the way to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he opened the bedroom door, another letter jumped into his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter lie quietly on the desk and seems to have been waiting for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein picked up the unpacking, gently unfolded, and saw a line of dark red-blooded words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the next one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
