			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is looking forward to slamming the letter and reading Azick’s reply:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ...the scene you described reminds me of some possibilities, thinking of vampires and aliens."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natural vampires in the stage of the dragon and giants withdrawing from history Before, it was close to extinction, and then they were discovered occasionally. The vampires we usually talk about in folklore are closer to the extraordinary. I remember that the sequence of a potion in a certain route is called 'vampire'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If your boss is already in a state of madness, then he is probably mistaken for this potion, a mixture of potions in two different ways." Half madness is the inevitable result. Well, I vaguely remember that the 'night' approach, which is what you call the 'sleepless' approach, can be interchanged with the 'death' approach, the 'giant' approach in high sequences, but this is not Including the path of 'vampires'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, you can't rule out the possibility that your boss can accept it. After all, 'vampires' can have a long life, excellent physical fitness, and excellent appearance. Compared with these benefits, the semi-crazy state is not unacceptable."<br />< Bryan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked awkward and didn’t expect Mr. Azke to provide such useful information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Death" route refers to the "collector" approach, which can be interchanged with the "sleeper" pathway in high sequences, which I used to be from Rose The secrets I learned in the diary, but I can't think of them, they can be exchanged with the "giant" route in sequence 4 and later... The "giant" route is the one that Silver City has mastered, that is, the current "God of War" approach... I have always suspected that the giant King Olmer is an ancient god of war...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Russell’s diary has a description of the Goddess Church and the God of War Church... ... Is it because the sequences of each other are interchangeable at a high level? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the premise of this speculation, the three most ancient churches of the Church of the Storm, the Church of the Eternal Sun, the Church of Knowledge and Wisdom, and the three most ancient churches hate each other. You can get a certain explanation, because the "Sailor", "Singer" and "Reader" paths that they master separately can be exchanged in high sequence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in the "Pale Age" at the end of the last era, the main pusher of the god of death is probably the goddess of the night and the god of war...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain's usual state is normal, except for the bad memory, there is no one-and-a-half crazy performance, you can rule out the possibility of taking the 'vampire' potion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Azick recently recalled a lot of things... Isn’t the “squirming hunger” really irritating him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded gently and continued reading:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Different' is not a The name of the race, but a description of many similar creatures. They are no different from human beings in normal times, but there is always an instinctive, distorted, suppressed desire in their hearts. As long as they encounter specific scenes or the stimulation of specific things, It will erupt, it will become a monster, and it will satisfy the desires of bloodthirsty and killing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When everything subsides, they will return to normal, and Every time they break out, they will be ruthless and eventually the mind will be completely distorted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The only common example of this is the werewolf, which I can recall. They are usually equated with human beings and cannot be identified with most extraordinary abilities, but at the full moon, the distorted desire in the heart will increase and the body will change accordingly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Your boss may be a hidden 'heterogeneous' The death of his teammates inspired his nature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The above are my personal guesses, because the memory is not complete, I can't assure you that there is no Other possibilities, perhaps the guess of the out-of-control precursor can be explained."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whether it is taking the 'vampire' potion, or it is itself a 'heterogeneous' It can't be saved. Of course, it has been speculated that 'heterogeneous' were originally normal humans, but they were polluted by strange curses or evil spirits, so they will become different monsters under certain conditions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting down the stationery, Klein looked at the desk with a dignified look and thought for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has to admit that the "heterogeneous" may exist, but the factors that are out of control can not be ruled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can only wait for Ms. Dai Li’s feedback... I sent the letter the night before, she should have received it yesterday morning, and in time, I wrote last night. Or I can see it this morning... It’s almost noon... The little messenger didn’t dare to approach the Chanis Gate? Or did Miss Dai Li have other things to delay?” Klein shook his head and felt that he was still very tired, so he relied on Meditate, forcing to fall asleep again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fascinating world, he suddenly wakes up and knows that he is dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he saw Dunn Smith appear in front of him in a black thin trench coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the normal dreaming reaction, Klein screamed slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning ...Captain..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng gently sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leonard is at In the process of tracing the Llanus case, I found a clue that you need to help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sneak peek of the Holy Church, because The steam train has failed and will arrive tomorrow morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good..." Klein replied fluently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn thought and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to return to Zouteland Street. Go straight to No. 62, Howard, where Leonard will be waiting for you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Working hard.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice just fell, Klein’s dreams were broken, and the eyes subconsciously opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horse Block... Isn’t this the Divination Club, my classmate Welch, and the neighborhood where the former Aurora member was located? There are so many recent things, one by one, just like what is brewing... Klein slowly rose up thoughtfully, went to the bathroom to clean himself, and then put on a white shirt, brown The vest and black thin windbreaker, take a half-high silk hat and go downstairs to the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is less than 11 o'clock, Benson and Melissa have not yet returned, Klein confessed to the maid Beira, saying no need to consider their own lunch . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he arrived at the Howth Street in a public carriage, and saw the "Midnight Poet" of the hair with a messy beauty in front of the house number 62. Nad Mitchell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the weather is getting cold, Leonard is still wearing only a thin white shirt with a beige trousers. Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is very likely that the house is rented by Llanus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you find it?" Klein asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard pointed to his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since you are from Hood. There is a clue in the root, and it is suspected that Lalhous is likely to have a relationship with the member of the Aurora, um, the cloth merchant Sirius Aripis. I can only change my mind from the aurora in the absence of normal investigation. I will look for this line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The previous report showed that many residents of Siris and Howls district had contacts, and I checked it again. I found some problems here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the problem?" Klein nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard picked an eyebrow: "The obvious problem is that the tenants here rarely appear, after the death of Hainas Vansente. Claiming to go to the Southland to do business, never come back, his information is very real, the police did not find anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
