			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone sneak in? Klein didn't immediately stand up and sit up. He just turned his body and put his right palm under the pillow. He quietly took the "cancel the clock" revolver. At the same time, he slowly relaxed his left hand and five fingers, so that "wreathing hunger" was in a state of being excited. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——After knowing that it was difficult to find food for “squirming hunger” after returning to Bakerland, he sneaked into the prison in the city of Conte in Desi, and found a The condemned prisoner confirmed that the crime was correct and was fed to the glove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Rose School" person locked me? No, it can't be so fast. Besides, if they are, they will definitely not come to the door, but wait for the opportunity to fight when I pass through a remote place, so as not to alarm the official power of Beckland... I am The amount of donation on the Moon Mass is too much, and is targeted by criminals? Well, a foreign rich who has come to Beckland for a long time is really easy to be the target of others... Of course, it may be a routine investigation of the "nights"... One by one, Klein heard There was a small movement coming from the large balcony of the semi-open room next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the lock core is slightly audible, and the floor-to-ceiling windows are almost silently pulled apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened carefully and noticed that footsteps passed through the semi-open room and into the hallway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly paused, the footsteps came toward the master bedroom, and then the more the past, the door handle of the room where the close-up man was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrong? Or is it to find Richardson? In the heart of Klein's heart, he released the right palm of the remnant holding the "Stolen Bell" and reached out to the iron cigarette box not far from each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he removed the "wall of spirituality", a phantom figure wearing a dark red coat and an old triangular hat instantly appeared next to him and walked into the whole body mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Senniol’s “Resentment” secret singer jumped into the glass window of the Richardson room, he saw a brownish complexion with a soft outline The black figure of the hair walked out of the door, and Richardson sat silently on the edge of the bed, leaning forward and arching his back, just like being in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expression is sometimes fearful, sometimes embarrassing, and sometimes reveals a feeling of weakness, and ultimately to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough to come to Richardson... The image is close to the Southland race... Agile, skilled, should not be ordinary people... This is Richardson’s friends who met in the manor on the South Island, or the relationship between his mother? Richardson is just a personal servant with a salary of 35 pounds a year. Is there anything I need to find him to help? Klein made a guess in his heart while observing from the perspective of Senol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he suddenly understood why Richardson was good at observing and liked to look at pedestrians on the balcony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is afraid to be found by some people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that it’s not a big problem, don’t affect my plan... wait for a divination... If Richardson can’t solve the problem, then I had to find an excuse to dismiss him... Klein saw that the close-servant had re-liated, and he recovered the "resentment" secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, living at 7th, Pfister Street Nad Mitchell once again entered the sleeping Beckland, shrouded in fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has previously asked Mike Joseph, a reporter for the Daily Observer, that Sherlock Moriatti is not actively involved in the blue The Ers incident, but the conclusion of being hired, allowed the other party’s suspicion to plummet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this big detective is also on the verge of the Kapeng incident, and has a close relationship with Emlin White of the Harvest Church, Leonard. Mitchell wants to abandon the investigation and continue to pursue the whereabouts of Insz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Sherlock Morietti has not many friends at the Craig Club, one has died in the incident of Prince Edessac, one is Mike Joseph reporter, so Leonard’s current goal is only one: Dr. Allen Chris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the dream, he casually found a sofa and sat down, looking at the opposite Dr. Allen: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You specifically talk about you and Sherlock Moria I know how to pass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen in the dream did not conceal, from Mrs. Mary introduced Sherlock Moriati to join the Craig Club, I was invited As a referee, I always talked about the big detective suggesting that he would tell the bishop of the Night Goddess Church about the unusual things he encountered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As described in the facts, Sherlock Moriatti’s attitude toward the official forces is quite kind and has been endorsed by Essinger Stanton. ... Leonard glanced at Dr. Allen’s bearded Sherlock, regained his gaze and continued to listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen finished the related matter in detail, and ended up: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He went on vacation in the South, I have never been back, I am always worried.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, he is a big detective with wisdom and love, I think he should not have any problems. I hope he will have time to attend the celebration party after my child was born. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe..." Leonard suspected that Sherlock Moriotty would not return to Beckland.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately politely left and walked out of Dr. Allen’s dream.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps, he subconsciously looked back I saw that there was a garden with a garden, and the misty balls that represented the dreams were staggered and filled with all the space without any problems.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s mine Illusion? I always feel that there has been a change in my body... Leonard whispered and turned to fly to Pingster Street.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in sight, the fog was deep A gas street lamp was dull and pale.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Leonard stopped flying and turned his eyes to a building.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the house, five or six fascinating light balls are suspended quietly, no different from other buildings around.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nader’s inspiration, house There seems to be a black group that absorbs all the light.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he finds himself not knowing the street in this neighborhood.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so worried that he wondered if he had seen something that he shouldn’t see, and he was busy taking his eyes off, preparing to leave here and rushing to where he was.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there was a playful voice in the building that looked ordinary:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is better to come in Sit and have a cup of tea? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All thoughts in Leonard's mind exploded in an instant, and I didn't want to fly at high speed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; In his inspiration, the rear townhouses and garden buildings grew bigger one by one, the doors and windows turned into mouths, and they bite him!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nearby black-black gas light poles grew up and turned into a steel jungle, which seemed to be blocking Leonard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard did not Stop, no look back, only the coldness of the vest is becoming more and more pronounced and richer!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is gradually stiffer, as if he has been caught by countless invisible hands The body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he thought he couldn’t support himself, the familiar lights of the familiar familiar houses in front of the house greeted him. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard is busy holding his breath, falling down and falling into his dreams!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call...he Under wake up, sweating cold sweat <br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "the old man, I have actually encountered what? Leonard retracted his legs on the edge of the desk and asked with fear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
