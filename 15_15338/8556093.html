			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploring a circle, Klein, who had no other discoveries, returned to the ancient palace supported by the pillar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat at the top of the bronze long table, half closed his eyes, examining the contrast between his spiritual growth and the number of members that can be drawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Counting the unburdened, you can still pull in four new members, but there is no target for the time being..." Klein shook his head and stopped staying. , returned to the real world, busy for a good dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut potatoes, yak meat, onions, stir fry for a while, sprinkle with sugar, pepper and other condiments, Klein pours the prepared hot water In the saucepan, cover the lid and reduce the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that the ability of the "magician" to manipulate the flames is a good helper for the kitchen... Since it has been, my cooking has improved significantly...if there is no Out of control, no monsters, no search, no evil spirits, everyone is committed to such a pollution-free application ability, the world is peaceful, beautiful... Klein lamented, leaving the kitchen and entering the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the gas wall lamp spilled out, and Kline, who was planning to turn the magazine to wait for the opportunity to place potatoes and carrots, and put the right amount of salt, couldn’t help but think about it. The problem of playing "no face":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I wake up this morning, the spirit is completely stable, I found that the 'no face' potion in the body is not There are signs of digestion, but there is a certain degree of fit with me. This is a phenomenon that has never happened before the 'divination', 'clown', and 'magician' medicinal foods..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein looked up at the belly window, because the outside world was dark, it became like a mirror, faithfully reflecting the dark brown hair, The image of Sherlock Moriatti with a beard and a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This may be because I have been In playing Klein Moretti, um... In a sense, Sherlock Moriatti is just Kline’s disguise, not another person.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Although there are many memory fragments received, I have some of the original feelings, but in essence, I am still a stranger to the world, the core keyboard strong Zhou Mingrui. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past five months, I have experienced too many things. Sometimes I even think that I am Klein Moretti." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent, one thought flashed in Klein’s mind, which gave him a lot of insights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I’ve always been wearing Klein Morettii’s Zhou Mingrui... I have never given up my plans to go back... He slowly closed his eyes, and then When opened, the figure on the convex belly window has changed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a young man with dark brown hair and short black hair. It looks like Sven, but the bags under the eyes are obvious, and the chin has a double-layered precursor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Zhou Mingrui from the Earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long time no see... Klein sighed, raised his hands and rubbed his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he put his arms down, he has changed back to Sherlock Moratti. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After such meditation and adjustment, he inexplicably felt that there was a lot of gap between spirituality and potion, and there were signs of a slow transition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder the teacher of the master of the secret master, Rosago, maybe a teacher, will say, you can pretend to be anyone, but you can only be yourself ...... This should be the core code of the 'no-face-to-face' method. Once you forget this, it is easy to lose yourself in the constant change and eventually become a monster.” Klein recalled the gains from the psychic before. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up his right leg and leaned back, quickly having a future schedule:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Exploring and summarizing the specific rules of the 'no-face-to-face'...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the extraordinary circle of Beckland, at the Tarot Conference Collect information about mermaid and prepare for the completion of the ceremony...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get the 'Sun God Official' potion formula directly or indirectly, help the small 'Sun' to be promoted to Sequence 7, and be eligible to remove the mental pollution of the out-of-controllers in extraordinary characteristics.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"But you can't completely hope for the little 'sun', you have to try to collect it yourself. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kline, who was gradually precipitating, made a slap in the face, making the fire in the kitchen a little smaller, and the smell of beef began to pervade.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he heard the sound of the doorbell being heard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visitor was a lawyer at Jürgen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the rain is sloppy, the ground is wet and there is water, and Jürgen is still wearing a meticulously worn, even wearing a vertical hard collar.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter? Klein and the other party were quite familiar, did not do the cold, asked directly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgen put away the black umbrella and patted the double-breasted long dress. A little water on the road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock, I will leave Beckland next Monday, go to the South with my grandmother, where the warm environment And clean air is perfect for her. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a very good thing. Klein took the initiative to make a reasoning and asked with a smile. "Do you want me to adopt Brodie for a short time?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurgen shook his head seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My grandmother is reluctant to separate from Brodie and insist Bring it, I asked, just put in a cage, buy a full ticket, it can also be on the steam train, but must always pay attention to clean the cage, can not pollute the air above. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the taste in the third-class compartment is enough to overwhelm the stench of the meerkat... Klein chuckles:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brody should be very unhappy to go out? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it is even more reluctant to my grandmother. "Jurgen responded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed the hat and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I am here to inform you that if you need bail and legal disputes during this time, you can find my colleague. This is his business card. I have already communicated with him. He will not leave Beckland this year. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real career, I also specifically considered this issue... However, I should not need it for the time being, I am now a "machine heart" informant, Under normal circumstances, they will not be caught in the police station... Klein smiled and thanked him, took the business card and stuffed it into his pocket.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No chat and enter in Jurgen The idea, immediately karate: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to visit other customers, Sherlock, see you tomorrow, no, see you next year. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I have to say it in advance, your family is happy New Year." Klein waved with a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was sent to Mr. Ergen’s umbrella, Klein closed the door and sat back in the living room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, in addition to the flame in the kitchen, there is no other sound in the room, quiet to Klein can hear the movement of the distant carriage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly looked around and saw the coffee table, contract, cabinet, pen, porcelain cup, dining table, chair and wall.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting his eyes, Klein leaned back against the back of the sofa, looking out at the dark nights and nights outside the window to emit the radiant gas streetlights, sighing in the deep cold and silence:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New Year..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning gradually calms down, and the darkness becomes the master of the earth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exploration team of Silver City goes through a long but not short trek and zero stars battle, . To reach the destination <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;With the inability of the animal skin lanterns to reach far, Dairik Berg saw a wall that was almost completely collapsed, and saw a street that was not broken but had no weeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On both sides of the street, the houses are mostly collapsed, and only a few are barely supported, but the surface is all mottled, full of time dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coating based on white and blue, which is different from the spire structure of Silver City, is also gray, making it hard to imagine their original Look like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Dairik can use this to glimpse the city once, it must have experienced a long period of time, with quite a lot of residents, in the dark In the age of development, it developed its own civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humans here take the potion, repair the building, defend the city walls, a team of five or six, explore outside, hunt monsters, find a place to survive Required resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will celebrate in a short period of peace, worship the gods, eager to get a response, will give birth to the next generation, and hope will continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, they eventually annihilated in the dark, losing all their voices, leaving only one ruin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ruin is like a huge tomb, burying a civilization that struggles to survive but disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Demon Hunter" Colin looked around in a circle, his face a bit condensed, just like seeing the future of Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the front:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Other places have been cleaned up.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The temple is at the center of the city. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploring the squad slightly spread, but still maintains sufficient order and does not relax the alert around.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the ruins that have been ruined for a long time, and through a quiet and maddening street, Dairik finally saw a broad platform that was purely artificially built.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the high platform, there is a semi-collapsed building, which is very similar to the temple of Silver City, with stone pillars supporting the dome and arches to create the gate.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is completely different from the style of other buildings here. It really turned out to be the "fallen creator" that was later converted... Dairik just flashed such an idea, the four lanterns in the team At the same time, it was extinguished!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, the entire exploration team fell into pure darkness, there was no lightning in the sky, the ground lost candlelight, and the breathing of humans around it It seems that I have disappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek’s body is tight and tight In the dark, there seems to be a monster sticking out his tongue and trying to lick his own scalp, but his inspiration tells him that there is no actual thing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, his voice sounded awkward and helpless, and he was afraid of dryness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a child whispering:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me...help me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick stayed for a while, I don’t know what to do, but in a flash Between them, there was a little shimmering dust in front of his eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust blasted one after another, igniting a smear of silver and illuminating The surrounding area.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin stared at Dairik, sinking the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What are you thinking? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric was sober, shyly clasped his hands and reached the front of his mouth as if praying.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body immediately swayed a pretty clear light, letting the darkness of the surrounding retreat silently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other players seized the time and re-ignited The candle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the "Hunter" responded promptly, this time there were no players missing and no new members.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
