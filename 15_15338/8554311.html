			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only candle swaying the dim candlelight, and the shadows on the walls around the living room floated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein found the most convenient place to escape, looked around and saw the "wisdom of wisdom" old gentleman with deep cheeks and saw The face of the chubby "pharmacist." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, after another comparison, although he wears an iron mask that covers the upper half of the face, it is still basically confirmed that he is me in Les The man in the circus small theater owed a man... Klein regained his gaze and waited for the party to officially begin - the woman with the "artisan" behind it was very tightly covered, like most participants, so he could not Confirm that she has arrived before the other party opens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, "The Eye of Wisdom" looked up at the mechanical wall clock on the wall, and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people who come today are very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Begin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; His voice has not fallen, the chubby pharmacist has pre-empted: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need an extraordinary creature to do experiments, preferably beasts, preferably Already subdued, not too dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bee creatures? Klein heard a little touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered the words that the other party said in the circus small theater, remembering the idea that the other party seemed to be able to read the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a “pharmacist”, but he has the ability to do this, and he is still buying extraordinary creatures of the beasts. Well, I’m selling the medullary crystal of the Elven Spring. After giving it to him, he should have gotten the materials and got promoted...that is, the sequence behind the "pharmacist" is related to driving the beast? Klein made a speculation based on known information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, someone sneered and responded to the "pharmacist":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who will take extraordinary creatures Stay with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s dangerous, and it’s easy to be discovered. Isn’t it easier and more concealed to kill extraordinary materials directly?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pharmacist" never confessed in language, immediately screamed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid thoughts!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't guarantee that the extraordinary material on the extraordinary creature is exactly what you need, just sell it, it's better to tame it, drive it, let it be Helper, double your strength..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, his voice is getting smaller and he feels that he has revealed some secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dog! Why can't I stop this mouth! The pharmacist took a slap in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough... Klein was invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand of the pharmacist is undoubtedly unsatisfied. Most of the participants here are not high in sequence, and Beckland is not a prominent person. They are all more vigilant, close to being reluctant to maintain, how can they still have a superb creature in luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, more importantly, wild supernatural creatures are often hostile to humans. Once they meet, it’s not that you die, that is, I die, if you want to catch it, There must be a strong enough team, or crushing each other in strength. Of course, it cannot be ruled out that certain sequencers have special abilities that are suitable for this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a disappointment, the pharmacist coughed two channels:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I brought a lot of potions Come here, you know the effect, want, and wait until the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also the treatment of injuries, violent self and improve that ability. Several medicines? Klein whispered a low-pitched voice and made an idea for the other party:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, the premise of everything is that you have enough financial resources to deal with the defective products that are out of control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pharmacist listened for a few seconds, for a while才道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a luxury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just give myself money, look for The extraordinary materials needed are hard enough. It is a high probability that the animal taking the potion out of control. It is difficult to succeed without a few more times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people who can do this must have mines or open a bank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Justice" of our Tarot Club should have an extraordinary Creature... Klein suddenly felt sad for the pharmacist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you really want to let go of the money, the pharmacist is definitely the type that is the easiest to gather a lot of wealth in the low sequence, but the problem is that it is also easy to be Official extraordinary people are eyeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several transactions or completions or abortions, Klein heard a deliberately low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I only brought an extraordinary weapon this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a 50-shot bullet with different effects, 20 of which are engraved with the sun field The logos and symbols form a complete spell, which can effectively purify ghost monsters and damage more powerful grievances and shadows. Therefore, it is called 'purification bullets', and there are 20 rounds of filthy creatures called 'hunting.' The magic bullets, the other 10 rounds are more sinister evil monsters, called 'exorcise bullets', the effect can be maintained for 18 months, or even longer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "50 rounds of 500 pounds, or 'barbarian' potion formula, and comes with a special revolver of appropriate caliber."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my last proposal I made a similar bullet, but it seems to be more complicated than the ordinary extraordinary weapon. It took so long to make a set... Klein didn’t give it to others. Opportunity, direct channel: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have the potion formula of 'barbarians'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At this time, a very tall man also offered a price: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"550 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In contemporary times, this is the most convenient weapon to carry and use! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very succinct lady’s voice is filled with joy that is difficult to suppress:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, Mr., I prefer the 'barbaric' formula."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"600 pounds." The man raised the offer again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is not a question of money." The woman behind the "artisan" looked sideways at Klein, "The deal! But please give the recipe first. 'The Eye of Wisdom', Mr. Old, he was identified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, but I got the "Black Emperor" card, or else I have to raise the price. The sly person will definitely have a big bleeding today... Klein rolled up his robes and took out the "barbarians" formula that had been written from the inside pocket and took a look:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 8 'barbarians', the main material: a mad grass, solid rhinoceros of the earth rhinoceros, auxiliary materials: a deep-grain walnut, a lemon balm, poplar bark soaked The pure dew 10 ml, the spirits 100 ml."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After confirmation, Klein refolded the paper and handed it to the waiter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As before, the old man of "The Eye of Wisdom" took out the ring of many fine diamonds surrounded by green gemstones, simulating "notary" The extraordinary ability to confirm that the formula is real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old gentleman announced that "the formula is effective," the woman with the "artisan" behind her clearly sighed and put a palm-sized square tin box Take it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the waiter’s delivery, she got the formula and couldn’t wait to be flat on the spot. She looked at it several times and seemed to want to remember it directly, while Klein held the iron. The box, opened openly, examines the harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
