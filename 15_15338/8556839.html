			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sturdy brawny is wearing a navy-specific blue-and-white striped shirt, still naked in the cold weather near zero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the dagger and resisted the throat of the opposite man, but he was pointed to the eyebrow by an old handcuff that could enter the museum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the handcuffs is also a strong man with more than one meter eight, strong muscles and shiny face. He shaved his hair and tattooed the sea eagle.骂骂咧咧道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The shit navy!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one dares to dare in Damir Port I am a pirate informant! "The<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Navy confronted him without showing weakness, and both parties showed the rich swear words at sea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Klein watched for a few seconds, circling along the edge, coming to the waist and wearing a straight sword, hiding the handcuffed Captain Ireland, calmly and casually asked:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two drunken quarrels, in the port of Damir, in the surrounding waters, there has been such a rumor, 'Sea Eagle' Logan serves 'Black Tulips No. 'The owner. The navy mentioned this point just now, but happened to be met by ‘sea eagle’. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the "Black Tulip"? Isn't it the "Hell Admiral" Ludwig? Klein turned and sat down on the high chair in front of the bar. Tap on the wooden countertop:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A cup of Nanwell beer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"6 pence. "The skin color bronze, the white wine bartender rubbed the cup, and said with no enthusiasm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On land specialties, prices are higher than Beckland and Tingen Quite a lot... Kline took out a copper coin and counted 6 pence to the other party.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the conflict between Logan and the Navy was stopped by the guards of the bar. They talked to each other and retired to different corners.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it was a lost face, the navy hurried away after a dozen seconds, in the bar The atmosphere is getting warm again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to play cards? Captain Allan pointed to the stairway on the side of the bar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. "Klein's main purpose is to collect intelligence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan is subconsciously trying to shoot his shoulder, but it is blocked by his cold and sharp temperament. The dark red coat reminded me: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't look for a woman here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded and picked up the cup with the Nanwell beer and took a sip.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, don't trust anyone here, they have only a few words that are true. "Erlan took his own violent temper and set foot on the stairs leading to the second floor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at him sideways, his face was not Change the ground and ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Include you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...maybe. "Alan is a glimpse, and immediately laughs. "At least my reminder is true, um, I am a man and true!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That doesn't necessarily... There is a potion called "Witch" in this "world"... Klein takes back the line of sight, drinking slowly while listening to the surroundings The drunkards brag.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two or three minutes, a short, thin man took his own wine and sat next to Klein.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Man, you are like an adventurer. "He smiled slightly and smiled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can say that." Klein responded coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It can be seen that you are a hunter, a hunter chasing bounty and wealth." The short man glanced around, lowered his head and pressed his voice. "Have you heard of the 'ghost empire'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard of Amway, and I have heard of the Father and Savior who were sealed on the seabed... Ryan uses the power of “no-face-to-face” to exude signals that don’t come close to me:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Know, a huge, ancient, ghost filled with treasure Boat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have its clues!" The little man used an infectious tone. "We found some information and knew it next time." Where will it be! We don't want cheap pirates and navies, don't want to be robbed of wealth by others, so we decided to rent a armed merchant ship to go to that sea area, which would cost about £1,000. I have found 15 companions and raised 720 pounds. You have Interested in participating?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to wait for Klein to speak, he fumbled A stack of yellow-brown letters:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you won't believe it easily, in fact, no one will believe, but the 15 friends in front, After reading this information, I decided to join our program."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......I have a face that is easy to be cheated? Or, as long as the foreigners can't escape this kind of thing? Klein is considering whether to identify the letters, but the "sea eagle" Logan who has just argued with the people has come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Woody, you are deceiving again! You damn the mouse in the sewage!" Logan raised the little man and threw him to the bar. In the open space of the center, I fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brave man with a blue tattoo on his head sat in the position of Woody just now, and he smiled happily:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, this is our mouse in Port Damir, always doing something that undermines our reputation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, we are very Friendly, what do you want to inquire about, even if you are looking for me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, don't believe the jealousy of those guys, I am an upright person, and there is no relationship with 'Hell Admiral'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you emphasize it, the more suspicious it is... Klein thinks a little, his expression is unchanged, his tone is plain: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to know the recent rumors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." "Sea Eagle" Logan took a bar table, on the way to the bartender, “Come on a special bacon, I invite this guy to taste our most famous cuisine in Damier.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender is still a cold face, pushing the door Into the back of the kitchen, and soon came out a plate of red and white, fine texture of sliced ​​bacon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"5 pounds." He did not look at the "sea eagle" Logan, looking directly at Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"5 pounds." "Sea Eagle" Logan turned his head over his side, smiling and smiling, and raised his arm to show his muscles. "Everyone just now I heard, thank you for asking me to enjoy the special cured meat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t react to what happened, wait for the second time the bartender urged Only then did I understand that I was being deceived, and the other’s routine was quite deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First use a very easy to see scam to let "Sea Eagle" Logan play, get a good impression of the goal, and then on the grounds of the guests, order a price tag The special cured meat, the last turned face does not recognize people, upside down black and white, strong buy strong sell... No wonder when the "mouse" Woody was thrown out, those drunks did not have a smash... They are all afraid to serve the "Hell Admiral" Logan... How to deal with it? My current person is Galman Sparo, a slightly crazy adventurer and bounty hunter... Klein picked up the cup, drank a beer full of fragrant beer, and asked in a tone: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not directly grab?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed by, he saw a fist getting bigger and bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein punched his left hand and hit the chin of "Sea Eagle" Logan, hitting him to the bar position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right palm is a support, Klein is agile off the chair, close to the body that Logan is about to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tightened his thighs, his knees jerked up, and ran straight into Logan’s lower abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! Logan raised his back, his eyes protruding, and his mouth half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pulled the gun and put the left wheel into the other's mouth, pulling the hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I am..." Logan shouted vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked into his eyes and suddenly pulled out the revolver, a slam, and even the gun hit his fist on Logan’s side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logan’s teeth immediately fell off, and his mouth was full of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a heavy blow and pain beyond the limit, his eyes turned and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein supported his body and found a piece of banknotes and coins from his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the visual test did not exceed 5 pounds, Klein directly threw them on the bar, calmly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Don't look for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bronzed face of the bartender is somewhat white, panicking and shouting:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "My boss is 'white shark'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't look at him, let go, let the "sea eagle" Logan fall to the ground Then, he sat down again, forked a piece of bacon, and tasted it at the entrance. He only felt the flavor was unique, and the flavor of the spice expanded, scratching the stomach and throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having eaten two more pieces, he looked up and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your boss knows you and 'Sea eagle' collusion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, he, no..." The bartender replied with a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Klein’s tendency to not continue to attack, and paying the money quickly, the several guards who came together came back silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein drank a drink and glanced at the "sea eagle" Logan on the ground, calmly saying to the wine:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is Lutheville's informant, how many rewards can he receive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, he is not." The bartender shook his head. "This is the news that he himself spread out. The navy just took him for money! Only in this way can people here be afraid of him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When I heard this answer, the people who drunk at the bar all put down the cup, and even the drunkard squatted to Logan and spit on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呸! Pooh! Pooh! Many alcoholic followers have followed suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein re-headed and said that he would eat special bacon:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender sighed and wiped the cup and whispered the rumors in the past two months, which Klein had heard, and He just knew that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Navy’s "Plitz" armored ship destroyed a passing pirate group in regular training... The panic of the giant ship cannon began to spread Small and medium pirate forces... Some of them want to take advantage of the opportunity that the Ironclad Fleet has not yet formed, commit crimes, and take a sum of money to withdraw from this business... In the next six months to a year, the sea is not calm... Niort and "Twilight Lieutenant" Bratov Ivan clashed in the southern waters of the island of Sunia, fighting one battle, each sinking two boats... Klein only listened and gradually filled up belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
