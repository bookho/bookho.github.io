			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up at the wall clock, seeing that the time has passed by 8 o'clock, Alger put down the glass made of thick glass, squeezed the drunks coming and going, come On the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Rothde Islands are rich in coal resources, Bayam is like a mainland city like Beckland and Port Pritz, with a root on the street. The high black light pole, the burning light of the gas shines through the grid of metal, illuminating the neat ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger pulled his headscarf and slowly turned to the side of the alley, smelling the smell of alcohol in the end of the seal - the fragrant leaves bar Although there are toilets, but the number of customers in the peak period is obviously not enough, some unstoppable, unstoppable drunks have to come out to find a quiet place to solve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red moonlight passes through the clouds and shines into this alley. Alger is still thinking about whether or not to pretend to be like a point. Strong, full of smiles: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you deliberately revealing the news of 'flame' to us?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not stupid... Alger said to himself, slowly turning over the body, seems to be guarding against the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw seven or eight steps, a shadow of the person leaning against the wall, standing poorly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure is about 1 meter 78, wearing a top boat cap, the face is thin, the edges are sharp, and the appearance is extremely aggressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a black hair hanging down, half covering the dark green eyes on the left, which makes his own chilly softer. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the portraits of the night are often different from those of me, many well-known pirates can wander in the city without even disguising, but Alger is the interior of the church. People, who have seen many portraits drawn using rituals and participated in the pirate conference, have successfully linked the guys in front of them with a name on the rewards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not show this, deliberately hesitating and hesitating to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calm Scoal?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the main helper of “Steel” Maviti, an extraordinary person who is good at controlling emotions, calm thinking, but has no humanity. The reward amount is 1,500 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man pulled a black trench coat and smiled but said without a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Can I deny it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm... it doesn't seem like you can't deny that you deliberately mentioned 'flame' in front of Oruma. He is not a person who likes to keep his brain, and I am just the opposite. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never thought about hiding, I just want to use the information I got for some compensation. Between the ‘flame’ of one person alone and the ‘steel’ of a lot of helpers, people with normal heads know which one to choose. Of course, I hope that you will keep me secret. I don’t want to be pursued by ‘Iceberger’. "Alger calmly responded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School leisurely and slowly nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Tell me a little. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As I mentioned before, I met and recognized the 'flame flame' at the Gold Coin Casino, and he commissioned me to help me pay attention to 'Steel'. Whereabouts, hehe, he seems to want to fight back. "Alger smirked," we agreed on the contact point, which I think is at least 1,000 pounds of intelligence. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1000 pounds? Look up at the Red Moon, you are not dreaming! Scoel snorted. "This may be a trap. Don't you understand?" ‘flame’ is likely to find a helper, so we dare to look for us in the opposite direction. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether it is a trap, it should not be judged by me, 500 pounds, below this number, I would rather pretend that nothing has happened." "Alger is arguing for remuneration.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"300 pounds, you go with me to a place, stay for a while, avoid you selling this message to others People, disrupt our plans, wait for us to use this information, catch the 'flame', or pass his spirit, and then pay you, don't worry, food, wine and bed are free, no matter what, you are made money! If anything comes from your accident, hey, you should know the consequences. "School proposed in an unacceptable tone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't be more than two days, otherwise my crew will leave with my boat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For more than two days, I will inform them." Scull I don’t know when I have a sharp scalpel in the palm, and let it jump and spin like acrobatics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc. Alger detailed the contact point and corresponding contact information on No. 15 Xiangshu Avenue. Scull did not say more, turned around and led the way. Alger turned around and went to the street where he did not know, and entered a house with no features. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long time no see, blue-haired ghost ship captain." Opening the door is a black-haired old man, dressed as a local, wearing a loose strip Wide leg pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Quinn, you are really the 'inspector of the blood'..." Alger pretending to speak strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Quinn smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rumor is always true and false, you think it is False, maybe true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t have a gas wall lamp, holding a silver candlestick in his hand, leading Alger and Scull through the darkness The lobby enters the spacious and sturdy basement without windows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You stayed here for a while, and my friends and I were responsible for the guards and provided drinks and food." Old Quinn said with a smile, "in order to Expressing our sincerity, we will not disarm you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Alger took the initiative to walk to the basement's squat bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Quinn immediately closed the heavy stone door and locked the basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School did not stay here, hurried away, and repeatedly confirmed whether someone was being followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After changing to a rental carriage, he came to the Lun’s settlement in Baiam, which is where the superiors live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the garden house, Scull saw that Maviti was sitting on the sofa in the living room waiting for himself, the other accomplices either lying down, or standing, or Sitting, forming a semi-circle, the scorpion and the living corpses act as a vigilant role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steel" has thicker lips, darker skin, and curled up like a steel ball that is common in factories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the message reliable?" The muscles of his arms trembled with a sense of power, but the whole gave the illusion that the coldness was not like the living thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School nodded his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A pirate captain serving money, I He has been detained in Old Quinn. If there is any problem, he will definitely not be able to go out alive. I think he should understand this very well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, Scull reveals a cold smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, we still have to beware of accidents, which may be the trap of 'flame.'"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you do?" McVeigh asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze is the first to look at a pirate lying on the couch, the other side is set with a brown local robe, and the finger is rotated with a middle depression. Yellow brown straw hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the deputy of McVetti’s action, losing the sixth captain of his own ship in the battle with the “Twilight Lieutenant”. The thorns of Huntley, the reward amount of 3,800 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Obviously, Scull already has a way." Hunter used a straw hat to cover his slightly pale face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School laughs and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"John Smith's adventurer is not a Pytha More hidden identity, joined us? Inadvertently revealed this news to him, and let him think that we are still waiting for help, need to be the day after tomorrow or the day after tomorrow can be done.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
