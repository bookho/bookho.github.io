			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell was there, for a short time, he forgot to stand up and his head seemed blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he is mature, he has never encountered such a thing that he has stumbled on himself, taking the potion, and all aspects of the body have been enhanced. Even more so, the result is inexplicably falling today, and it is simply impossible to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you just step on? Dirkwell replied with enthusiasm, palms, and stood up, pretending that he had not fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked left and right, and did not find anything weird on the ground, with full of doubts, a few steps ahead, picked up the milky white dice. At this time, a patrolling police officer seemed to be aware of the anomaly here, carrying a short stick, pressing the left wheel, and ran across. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, fat pharmacist Dirkwell is suddenly worried, wondering if he is stepping on the trap:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They caught the old man, but they never came to me. They are actually monitoring in secret, waiting for me to find clues?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, I got this strange scorpion, and they are urgently coming out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The official extraordinary person came to arrest me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell’s instinctive response is I turned around and ran, but I had a little heavy weight just now. He had a sore knee and could only walk in small steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the patrolling police officers getting closer and closer, they want to run and can’t run, Dakwell’s mind shows a prison in the ground, forever Only the candlelight environment, the extraordinary person who is close to the side but violently wheezing in the darkness is like a monster...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" The patrolling police officer presses With a pistol, ask carefully through a certain distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkwell’s heart suddenly burst into an uncontrollable fear, his wrists trembled, and the milky white scorpion that had just picked up fell to the ground and rolled a few laps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it’s red at six o’clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of police officers’ review, Dirkwell’s voice trembled and replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got to the damn banana peel, I fell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, and he suddenly stunned because there was no banana peel on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, too nervous, it’s better to say that you stumbled yourself... Dakwell thought annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to summon the owls that were parked on the opposite roof to prepare for dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrolling police officer glanced at it and chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't forget to look at the foot I just thought you were robbed by someone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He released the palm of his hand and held the short stick and walked back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Dirkwell looked blankly at the policeman’s back and went farther and wondered how the other person simply believed himself. Full of wrong words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He retracted his gaze and looked at the milky white scorpion lying quietly on the ground, his brows gradually wrinkling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a pure Lun, these police officers do not need to please... Is it working? Whether it is my strange fall, or the convincing of the police officer, is it working? It is the one that the teacher kept, the important seal? Dakwell quickly had Lenovo, proceeded cautiously, picked up the scorpion again, and stuffed it back into the tiny ring box—in which the scorpion had no room to turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Takes a look at his own owl, Dakwell picks up the "News" he bought before, stopping a rental carriage, one by one The land was taken up and the destination was "Red Theater". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of steady vehicle driving, because the night has come, the light of the gas lamps on both sides is far apart, and only a small amount can be seen. He is not in a hurry. Studying the ring box and the scorpion inside, I waited patiently to go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the herbal medicine shop, up to the second floor living place, he lit the gas wall lamp, drove the stupid bird out of the room, and sat down at the desk, repeatedly checking the ring box and the milky white dice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he pulled a piece of paper folded from the bottom of the ring box to a size of only half a knuckle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkwell breathed a sigh of relief and quickly spread the paper, and found that there were three paragraphs written in Guuffsic:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I haven’t appeared after three days of the appointed time, it must have been betrayed and arrested. So, don’t rush to ask other members of the school for help because I can’t Confirm who made it, which will bring you a lot of danger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only thing you need to do is to bring the dice Go to Olawe Island and hand it over to the bell city of Kano, the port city. My teacher, Rychod's Member, is hiding there, and he will deal with it later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry that I will reveal this secret. When I finish this letter, the relevant memories will disappear completely, and I will not even remember you as an apprentice until I am saved, remember, try not to use that dice, it has a certain living characteristics, the more you use, the easier it is to wake up, turn yourself when you are not paying attention, even if there is no space. When it is fixed After '1', please believe me, you will be more painful than direct death, because you will fail almost everything, including your favorite bed exercise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Sure enough, this scorpion is very dangerous... Dakwell subconsciously sighed, and immediately found himself doing something stupid under the good heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He learned to save the teacher Roy Kim, defeated the timid, stayed in Byam, and sent a message of help to the members of the life school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And according to the content of the letter, this means that he is likely to be betrayed by Roy Kim’s eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you say it early? No, why didn't I think about going to buy this bitch early!" Dirkwell raised his hands and grabbed the sides. hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never dared to stay here, decided to transfer his residence tonight, decided to buy a black ticket tonight, and head to Olawi tomorrow morning. - It is an island on the route "Rosd Islands - Toskat". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My spell, my pistol, my bullets..." Dirkwell is busy counting points that provide a sense of security, lacking enough for himself Worried about the fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly got an idea, pacing back and forth, muttering: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I have to ask for a bodyguard and ask for a bodyguard..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who? How much is the price? In Dirkwell's thoughts, his eyes swept through the "News" that he brought back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, he thought of a wonderful bodyguard object:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German. Spa Luo! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A powerful adventurer who can hunt 5,400 pounds of pirates! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is willing to take this task, as long as it is not a "Members", I should be able to successfully reach Olav Island... How can I find him? Correct! Post a notice in the various bars that adventurers often see! Dirkwell nodded invisibly, stuffed a small amount of items back into the previously packed suitcase, took the chubby owl, and left the herbal shop again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the Rhodes Islands, a small port belonging to Lun The black death number stopped there without any scruples and was surrounded by three ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "disease lieutenant" who just took a hot bath wore a loose men's shirt to make the final treatment for the wound that had been basically healed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a witch, something like acne scars does not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the blonde maid knocked on the door and walked into the captain’s room when allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the Thunder, her face turned red, and she took a gaze:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
