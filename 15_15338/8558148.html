Daniz smiled and shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gently sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must recall, otherwise it is easy to recognize It’s fake.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is recognized as a fake...I?” Daniz raised his hand and pointed at his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s expression does not change: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a member of the Sauron family, owning Extraordinary anti-tracking techniques, along with some subtle movements and performances, are enough to confirm that she is the sequence of the 'hunter' route, 'arsonist', which matches you very well and you can play well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I? I can't! I don't make that look like that! I only need one look, I will be recognized!" Daniz was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein endured a smile, his voice low and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will put 'peristal The hunger 'lending you.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...no, no, I don't have experience in this area, I am sure I can't beat the 'sickness of the disease'!" Niz was unusually nervous and pushed away in horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his eyes, this is extremely shameful thing for shit, only perverts or lunatics can be done without psychological obstacles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein echoed and nodded and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, you are stupid. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz forcibly squeezed out a smile: "Yes, I am stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Klein stopped talking, crossed Daniz, and opened the door of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz’s gaze subconsciously followed, and suddenly found that the head of the German Sparrow became red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squinted his eyes and saw that the side of his face was soft, his eyes were green and deep, his lips were gently licking, slightly weak and swaying. There is a neutral sense of beauty, just like Eileen who has not left for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." watched the figure of Gilman Sparo into the carriage, and Daniz turned back and twitched his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He silently for a few seconds, silently said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a madman, said to be a woman If you become a woman, don't hesitate!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to say that Elaine's men's dress is really pretty." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This extraordinary ability is really practical. If I can get similar items and figure out what the ideal style of the captain’s mind is, I will I can make the corresponding changes and let her fall in love with me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can this be the case that she falls in love with me?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz got into a philosophical problem until a cough came from behind the car.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He woke up, drove the carriage, left the port, and prepared to go back around the big circle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey, the change of the shape of 'no face is' is very simple. The difficult part seems to be in the heart. If you want to play a good faceless person, many psychological obstacles must be broken one by one. If you don’t do this, you will have to spend A lot of time, the real role of a person for several years, recognized by the identity-related everyone, fully integrated into the role, even as they are true ... This is more challenging for me, the bottom line, more distorted and crazy.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to speed up the process, certain obstacles must be overcome. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pulled a suitcase from under the seat of the carriage, turned over the strips and clothing, and completely copied Yilian’s dress.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——He’s just getting Deniz to disguise, just borrowing the magical item made with the extraordinary features of “No Face” for “justice” for a few days. There are any problems.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this means that Daniz has a high probability of single-on-one face-to-face "disease lieutenant" Trey, no "clown" ability He will not be hiding for a long time, and there will be great danger to his life.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein will not and cannot let others take such risks for their own affairs, Therefore, he can only challenge himself and play in person.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he is exactly the same as Elaine’s, just under the black silk hat. The handsome face, soft and clear lines, green eyes are as beautiful as gems.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He adjusted his body It is a few centimeters shorter than the original, the shoulders are narrower, the skeleton is smaller, and it seems to be a lot lighter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s mind quickly emerged from his current Look, this is the ability of the "clown".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not bad, nothing... maybe there is no relationship with women, and with the change of German. Spa Luo, change Daniz, change other people is not much different, is a little more beautiful, the chest is a little tired ... If you are on the earth, I will grow this way, long ago no girlfriend. "He is half-self-deprecating and half-heartedly twitching his mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a normal movement on the German Sparrow, it seems Some pity and grievances.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day! Klein snorted, busy adjusting his mind, and invested a little bit into the real play.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, he found that his psychological barriers really faded a lot, followed by a kind of relaxation, a kind of calm, and the magic medicine seems to fit more.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the rate of digestion will get faster.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s useful...Klein silent Speaking to himself, he quietly got up, took four steps back and entered the fog, and once again confirmed the danger of the action.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the real world He switched to the voice of Elaine and deliberately lowered his voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to Port 6 Pier. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz didn't feel wrong. After changing his direction, he suddenly woke up and couldn't help but shudder: "It's the same as... if he changes day by day." I became confessed to me by the captain. I may not be able to tell..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the carriage re-entered the port and sailed to the original class of Yilian. The passenger ship, but not really close, circled a half circle and arrived at the nearby warehouse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz jumped off the carriage and sounded the warehouse in accordance with the agreed method The door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is a group of dock workers with obvious local ancestry, scattered around.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there is no other situation, the bald rebel army Karat is only in a wheelchair.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about people? He looked at Daniz Road.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Elaine, Daniz successfully established contact with the Rebels.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz laughs and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She drank a potion that lost her strength, and the effect lasted for ten hours.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, I took 7 percent of the 1,000 pounds of bounty. ten. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karate raised his right arm and waved, and suddenly two thin rebel forces got on the carriage.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, that woman. "They quickly found their heads and said in a local gangster tone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take her down, our mission is to protect her." Karat emphasized it again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two rebel forces immediately went to the carriage with the men’s Elaine.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein used the control of the "clown" to pretend to be vain and swaying.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was quickly transferred, coming In a room in the civilian area of ​​Bayam, at the same time, Karat told a local gang member who believed in "Poseidon" to go to "Gi Lishi" Ozil and tell the other side that he had found the target and let him Take 1000 pounds to change people. As for Daniz, they have already returned to the hotel to wait for the news.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, Ozl gave a message saying that he did not know it was true. It’s still fake, I want to send someone to confirm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karate has agreed to his request.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Near the evening, a figure appeared outside the house.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a lure wearing wide-leg pants, a brown jacket, and a local dress. Man, his eyebrows are very short, only half of the normal person, the eye sockets are deep, the scorpion is brown, and the edges are quite distinct.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karate pushes the wheelchair and comes to the door Looked at the man, he asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Missol. Kim? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should be honored, you know me." The man laughed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was originally the captain of a pirate ship under the hurricane of the "Hurricane Lieutenant", and was conquered by the "disease girl" Trey Later, he served as the third officer of the other party's flagship "Black Death", nicknamed "smart speaker", bounty of 5,400 pounds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karate did not respond, turn the wheel Let the road open.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missor, under the guidance of a gang member, entered the room inside and saw Elaine in a gentleman’s dress sitting At the bedside, the eyelids sometimes evade when they dodge, the teeth bite their lips, they are angry and scared, and they are desperate and stubborn.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is right, but I am not sure, because she has a very strong makeup, once a woman has made a heavy makeup, it is difficult to see her true look, wipe her face clean, I will recognize it again. Hey, why don't you wear her handcuffs? Do you know that she is dangerous? "Missor looked through it carefully and stepped back two steps with vigilance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She was medicated, had no strength, and now has no resistance. Since you are asking for this..." Karat moved the chin against a rebel army.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rebel army turned to find the handcuffs, went over, will Klein The hands were back-cut and smashed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, like the previous complex emotions, tried to show his acting: he was struggling and unable to do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, another gang member found water and rubbed his face with a rough towel.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Fortunately, many cosmetics in this era are not very waterproof... Klein began to adjust the lines and contours of the face with the cover of the towel.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn’t take long, Miso She saw the wet face of Elaine, only to feel that she had extraordinary softness and beauty in this state, and the green eyes were filled with deep hatred and incomprehensible confusion.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, she belongs to the captain... Misor’s throat squirmed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbs;</div>
