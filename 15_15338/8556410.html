			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Rose Manor, Sunlight House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed Sac. Augustus is standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, his face is gloomy, and he chooses to look at the opposite side of the face. There are volcanoes that are about to erupt in the sounds of silk: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you going to escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry's gaze crossed him and cast out the window, chuckling and not answering: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See the meteor shower just now? I feel the tremor of the earth." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of her, the porcelain and other things placed in the museum have already fallen on the thick carpet, the old butler Finkel is standing on next to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a very rare thing." Edsac responded with a deep voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry is slightly eyebrows:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are slow.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will tell you frankly that I am a witch! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of Prince Edsake did not change at all, he turned to look at the old housekeeper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You go to the door and keep everyone from coming in." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, His Royal Highness. Finkel glanced at Talis in a cold, and turned back out of the sun-dried house.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the sound of the door closed, Edsack slowed down Spit: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Terry Schik, oh, you prefer to be called Terry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that you are a witch, and people who buy extraordinary materials for you have not succeeded. The ones you got are all provided by me!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't mind if my Wang Hao is a 'witch' or a 'witch', I even saw your wanted order! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry is a glimpse of the sly smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot of knowing Well...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you know, I used to be a man, my real name is Tries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What?" Edsac’s eyes were round and slightly biased, and he couldn’t believe what he had heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry saw it, suddenly laughed, smiled forward and leaned back, extremely fierce, like a madman:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, you didn't get it wrong, I used to be a man! I used to be like you, the following is longer than you, thicker than you! But, the 'Witches' potion forced me to change my gender!< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it very disgusting? Has it already had a layer of chicken skin? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She vented her words for a long time and took two steps forward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Edsac instinct retreats back, the throat unconsciously squirming up and down once.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not like this...you are a real woman... ...no problem... I can confirm this! He first muttered to himself, and then he sang high voice. "From the time I met you, you are the real woman. What did you look like in the past? I don't want to know!" I can do it like no other things happen! What I like is that love is, now you! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry snorted and raised her hand to wipe away the tears that just laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are such a poor person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still don't understand? Our encounter is not a coincidence, even you like..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She paused like a stomach and continued: "Even if you like me, in other people's arrangements, don't you think everything is too fast and too fast? I believe in love at first sight, but I don't believe it has such a big Magic, you act like a protagonist in a three-stream love story. Just because you meet one side, you fall in love with obsessive love, fall in love with strangers, forget the goals you once liked, this is crazy!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince Edsac’s eyes were straight and his mouth was open, but he did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body suddenly swayed, just like finally waking up from a long dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, you are really the type I like...but my reaction, really, really, too exaggerated..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry's mouth is upturned and she smirked at the side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor person, even like this Things have been arranged by others, like the puppets holding the line.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still don't understand? You belong to the object that can be sacrificed, and I am both a hostage for the cooperation of the royal family and the witch sect, and a disguise necessary for deception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I carry the important items of the witch sect under your strict supervision, will be destroyed at any time, will lose treasure, this is the cooperation sincerity we show. And once things are exposed, they are known by the three churches or other factions of the military. The development of the matter will be very simple. Prince Edsac is eager for beauty, steals the witch, knows that the sin is deep, and he devours himself. Then, all the questions will be covered up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Edsack shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, his face asked distortedly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they doing with the witch sect? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could a hostage who may be abandoned at any time know?" Terry laughed. "This is all the reason I want to escape." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She buried her head, laughing low in a row, laughing and shaking her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, she looked up again and outlined the corner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do? I? Stripped my clothes and threw me on the bed? No, you should already have psychological barriers. In fact, I don't mind giving you some warmth now. It is not a shame to comfort each other." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince Edesack had a round face and silently watched Talis for nearly a minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he closed his eyes and pointed to the other side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You leave." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave from the door. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry has raised her eyebrows:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to let me go?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. Edesack turned to look out the window and replied slowly. "I will stop Finkel. As for whether or not I can escape other pursuits, I will see your own strength and luck." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry fascinated for a few seconds and hurried to the secret door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Before leaving, she couldn't help but look back:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edsack has no sideways, still staring out of the window, as if looking for the shadow of the past.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I? Let me live in this wonderful story and greet its final end, good or bad. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry took a breath, stopped staying and entered the dark door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... .........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint-Saill's Church, in a quiet room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Night Goddess Church One of the thirteen archbishops, the head of the Beckland parish, Saint Anthony Stevenson, received an urgent telegram from the Earl of Hall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This face is unscrupulous, and the old man with deep eyes is very clean, even wearing a black and red archbishop robes, it does not give a dull feeling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, anyone who faces him will tremble from the heart, as if he has ruled spirituality by fear, or faces the unknown existence of himself in the depths of darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry Schik... The original witch... St. Anthony patted the paper and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light around it suddenly disappeared, as if it was swallowed up by the darkness in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the entire church, all the believers in prayer have felt the coming of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything quickly returned to normal, St. Anthony appeared in front of the church at the bottom of Chanis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the team is responsible for the "dead wizard" Dai Li Simone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before she asked, the Archbishop of St. Anthony screamed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepare, enter the process, I want to wake up a seal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to use "0-17". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will use the horrible seal to confirm and deal with the things related to Trichic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only "0" seal that is kept outside the sanctuary. Only two high-level members of the entire church know it is in the Beckland Parish. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Lord Archbishop." Dai Li took a second and immediately responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting, St. Anthony closed his eyes and found some information about the seal "0-17" in his mind:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Number:17."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Name:XXXXX"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Hazard level: '0', very dangerous, highest importance, highest confidentiality level, can not be inquired, can not be rumored, can not be described, can not be snooped."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Privacy level: Pope, Group A researcher, and Archbishop in charge of Beckland Parish (Note: When the Archbishop is transferred from the Beckland Parish, the seal '1-29' is required to clear the relevant memory)”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seal method: complete the seal by the cooperation of '1-29' and '1-80'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Description: This is not an item.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a living angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He looks beautiful, his hair and eyes are black, suspected young women, the actual age cannot be estimated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"...He does not have the wings recorded in the books, but from the outside, there is not enough difference from ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...He has no ability to think, and has lost all his intellect.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... ...All people and objects close to Him will disappear completely... Through divination and other means, they can be confirmed that they are still alive, but they still exist, but they can never be found. At present, 1825 methods have been tried and all failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The influence range of '0-17' will expand and contract irregularly, and more than 70 researchers have now disappeared."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warning, He can't be used!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Appendix 1: This seal first appeared in the Quaternary pale age, the specific year, missing, specific date, missing, specific location, missing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Appendix 2: The information shows that He has been awakened five times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By passing the message and searching for the counterfeit Inns Zangweier, Klein, with the help of divination, defeated the interference of the "master key" and ran all the way to the exit position in the revelation. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
