			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the sun, the "Golden Dream" exudes golden brilliance, as if it were a moving treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi stood in the captain’s room and continually paced back and forth, trying to remember everything that happened during this time and finding clues for investigation. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days ago, his captain, "Lieutenant General Iceberg" Edwina announced that she would do a study that may not appear for ten or twenty hours. Therefore, the corresponding courses are all canceled. For this, Daniz and others are not surprised because this is a common occurrence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are delighted that they don’t have to take classes, they are drinking on the boat, they are singing and they are holding a bonfire party. They just did not ignite the “Golden Dream”. very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of time, including the dull Deniz, everyone is gradually aware that the captain who should have finished the study within 24 hours is The next day has not appeared, not even looking for people to send food and serve as a light beer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patience waited for a long time, still did not see "Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina's crew boldly ringed the door of the captain's room, horrified Found no one responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the leadership of the great deputy Bruce Worth, the pirates opened the captain's room and saw that there was nothing left! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They immediately went to the collection room and other places, but still could not find the "Iceberg Lieutenant" Edwina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to past experience, they initially suspected that the captain had thought of something temporarily, so he applied one of various mysteries or imitated the extraordinary skills of others, and hurriedly left. The "Golden Dream" did not have time to leave a message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, Daniz and others tried to contact the "Lingling Ceremony" and other methods. Without any response, they could only search the captain’s room and other places to find clues. Convince yourself to wait patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third day passed, "Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina still did not appear, did not respond, the crew began to panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dog, do you have a divination result? Are you not an expert in this area?" Daniz irritatedly turned to "flower bow tie" jord Sen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judeson, who is black-stained with gold, licks his forehead and uses a rather mellow voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Failure, all tracing of divination has failed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But for the time being certain, the captain is still alive, but he does not know where to go. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown Wals, who has a gray-haired short curly hair, pushes his monocle:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We must seek help, the captain's collection is not lost, she did not even take away some of the necessary magical items, which shows that the situation was very unexpected. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you looking for? Daniels, another long sailor with a lumpy waist, asked quickly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown Worth lifted the silver knives in his hand to himself The eagle hook nose: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back to the West Coast. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of his words is to find the "God of Knowledge and Wisdom" behind the "Iceberg Lieutenant" Edwina.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, returning from the pirate paradise to the west coast, across the Sunia Sea, through the North Sea or the raging sea, and then sailing in the foggy sea for a long time, the captain can't wait that long! She may have an accident at any time! "Flower Bow Tie," Jodson said, "We must find someone who can contact you quickly and can help in a short time." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz wanted to swear another "shit", but suddenly there was inspiration.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He can only contact one person very quickly, that is, Gilman Sparo, and this crazy adventurer never shows himself in front of him to be good at divination and mysterious background!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and looked around, clearing his throat: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a person to choose, I can contact him immediately, and he is very good at divination... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice has not fallen, "Gourmet" Bruce Wols, "flower bow tie" Jodson and "iron", "bucket" and others At the same time, I turned to look at him, with red eyes, shouting loudly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not too fast!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Daniz silently withdrew from the captain's room and returned to his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spreads out the stationery, picks up the pen, habitually gives greetings at the beginning according to the captain’s instructions, and then sings a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he stopped the pen and felt that it was too polite and embarrassing, not in line with the purpose of asking for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shit!" Daniz said one by one, brushing off the piece of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he wrote on the new paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help!! Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The captain is missing! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... although Galman Sparo is a madman who cannot guess with normal logic, but such a letter he does not understand... Shit! Daniz licked himself and tore off the second piece of stationery.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmed down, considered for a few seconds, and fell for the third time. Pen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he succinctly wrote the things before and after the captain’s disappearance, and attached the current position of the "Golden Dream" and then euphemistically Ask Mr. Gilman Sparo if he can help the collaborators.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Divination seems to require specific items..." Daniz Gang Folding the letter paper, suddenly I realized that I had missed it, and hurried back to the captain's room, and found a pair of pearl earrings that Edwina often wears.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After doing all this, he took out notes that recorded various mysterious knowledge, turned to the corresponding page number, and according to the experience he had before, he did not skillfully arrange the ceremony of summoning the messenger.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After putting a gold coin on the altar, he took two steps back and mourned in ancient Hermes:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a step back and used the ancient Hermes language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I call in my name:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spirit that lingers in vain, A friendly creature driven by, the messenger of German Sparrow. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creaking sound of the wind screamed, the flames of the altar candle swelled rapidly and stained with a marked paleness.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renee. 缇 Nicole drilled out slowly and slowly, still wearing the dark and long black dress, carrying four identical beautiful heads.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz thought that the messenger would bite the gold coin and the envelope with paper and earrings as it did last time. Who knows the four heads in Renee’s hands? Turning around, looking around, and finally focusing on the direction of the captain's room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, the two heads of Renee Nikol’s hands finally Biting the gold coins and envelopes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the eccentric messenger disappeared, Daniz took a breath and wiped his forehead, feeling that there was a kind of inexplicable Pressure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olavia, another hotel room .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is about to win a lot of money for Anderson Hood to buy a ticket to the "generous city" Baiyam, the inspiration suddenly touched.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the white bone messenger, when I first appeared, I was able to detect that she had completely entered the real world, and my inspiration was touched... Kline thoughtfully took over one of Renee’s Nicole’s heads. Biting the letter. At the same time, he found that Anderson’s inspiration was not worse than himself, and he almost responded at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is...the messenger?" Anderson asked with uncertainty, and seemed to have heard of this, but did not really see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had no expression in his head and took the envelope off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, pearl earrings? Klein unwittingly broke out the stationery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson next to him curiously came over and looked up and down Renee. Nicole Cole, 啧啧 : ::<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is an indescribable bloody beauty..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s not falling, his hands suddenly lifted and he held his own The throat, his tongue sticking out, his mouth spitting, and Renee Nikol, who was empty on his neck, did not react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned his head and studied it carefully. He looked at his messenger and silently said a few words:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Much like Miss Sharon's ability... Miss messenger belongs to the 'Prisoner' route? No, not sure, she is a spiritual creature, it is normal to be good at this..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that Anderson is going to die, Klein is slow to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, he will help me. Leading the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renee. Nikol turned his head in his hand and stared at Anderson with scarlet eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth of each of her heads is open one after another in a very orderly manner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ......""Made..." "Lives..." "Same..." "Can..." "Lead the way..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, Anderson's hands finally stopped, leaving his neck, leaving a noticeable deep finger mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, call... This strongest hunter gasps, bends and retes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quickly browsed through the letter and figured out that the sender was Daniz, the "known big pirate" called "Iceberg Lieutenant" mysteriously missing I need to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of sight just left the letterhead, and Klein was horrified to find that Renet Nikol was still there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not occult... The messenger will not disappear after sending the letter, and then summon it to appear again? Klein considered it and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have anything else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Wait..." "You..." "Back..." "Letter..." Renee's four heads said in turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know that I will reply?" Klein looked at Anderson who had not recovered, convinced that the strongest hunter could not pay attention to this. The words of the Mann Sparo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Renet’s head once again said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“her...” "Missing..." "Very..." "Weird..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?" Klein thought for a moment that Miss Courier peeked Dani. Letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heads of the simple, long-haired, light-haired hairs each spit out a word that constitutes a complete statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I..." "Inspected..." "On board..." "The situation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
