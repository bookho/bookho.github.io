			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moon Puppet"...Fuls thought in a move, took back the divergent attention, and looked sideways at the party members who had just spoken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman wearing a black mask has shown a small puppet and showed it around:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My friend found a small tomb in the depths of the Pas Valley in the South Continent. This puppet was inserted in the right eye of one of the deceased."<br /><br />&nbsp ; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folse, like other party members, carefully examined the puppet and found that it was slender, and the overall resemblance of a small wooden peg was engraved with crescent moon-like eyes and mouth, full of inlaid Dried grass and flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks nothing special...Fuls sighed in his heart, the inspiration did not touch anything, the pen in her hand still hovered in a book Copper green notebook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman wearing a black mask continues to introduce:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My friends and I have not Can confirm the role of this puppet, just suspect that it is not so simple, perhaps hiding a small secret.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"60 pounds, as long as 60 pounds, you can It buys, the price is very fair, even if it really has nothing to do with the mysterious field, it is also a good antique, can be worth 40 to 50 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, spend 10 pounds to buy a surprise, for you, this is only a small sum of money."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a tempting rhetoric, this gentleman should be a successful salesman, but I don’t even have 10 pounds... Folsie laughs at the same time and thinks that the presence should not Someone will buy the so-called "moon puppet" whose origin is unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She’s just getting started, she suddenly heard a deliberately depressed woman’s voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too rich, willing to gamble on luck? Folth subconsciously turned his head and looked at the party members who spoke. He saw the lady wearing a hooded robes and her face hidden in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the owner of the "Moon Puppet" laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I prefer Keep it for yourself, maybe when you can find it special."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he found that no one else has increased the price, so the words turned道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, as a gentleman, since you express your cravings and the price is reasonable, then I am willing to satisfy your wish."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete." The hooded lady responded with a loud voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the waiter of the party master helped them complete the transaction, and Firth noticed that the lady had a slight trembling when she got the "moon puppet" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She values ​​this item very much...she may really know the puppet’s special...the moon puppet...the moon...from the south continent...Fol There are associations and thoughts. I remember the "primitive moon" believers that Mr. "Moon" hopes to find. I suspect that the hooded lady is one of them, or there is a connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, she has no evidence, and even the reasons for speculation are not strong enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call...Fuls breathed a sigh of relief and decided to find a way to verify it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She likes to flip the hard-shell notes in her hand and present a yellow-brown parchment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper is printed with deep or shallow lines of texture, which constitute a strange picture of unclear and simple mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the pages of Lemano Travel Notes, which records an extraordinary ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not one of the five pages that Furth later found opportunities to record, but one of the five pages that existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls raised his head and pretended to observe other people’s transactions, and all the circumstances beside the lady wearing the hood were included. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She noticed that there were only dark brown spotted mosquitoes on the nearby wall, and unknown insects crawled slowly on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls's fingers naturally and lightly slipped through the dark patterns on the yellow-brown parchment, and there was a complex symbolic shape in mind. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sound and no exception. She feels that she "reads" the spotted brown mosquito, and her own thoughts are connected with the other's thoughts. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spotted brown mosquito flew up and flew low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wraps around the lady wearing a hood and carefully sticks it in front of the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision of the spotted brown mosquito is different from that of human beings, and it forms an incomprehensible sight in Firth’s mind, but it quickly disintegrates, recombines, and outlines The corresponding normal picture: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hooded lady has a softer outline, a darker complexion, a slender eyebrow, and a more drooping corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;False immediately recognized the other person, she is the "primitive moon" believer "Wit" who wants to find Windsor Behring! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A valid clue of 100 pounds, directly locked to 500 pounds! Fols recalled the content of the reward, and his heart was burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her first reaction was to drive the spotted brown mosquito, biting Windsor Bellin normally, sucking her blood, so that she would Can use "astrology" to directly lock the opponent's whereabouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after she struggled for a while, she gave up on this idea because it was the most taboo act of the extraordinary party, as long as it was discovered, it would definitely be all The party members were besieged to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The convenor of the party always has good strength, too much too much fire, it is easy to be noticed by the other side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, earn 100 pounds, then have an extra chance to consider the problem of direct locking... I have to leave the party early and apply blood to Lemanno's travel notes "surface, so as not to get lost, it is very dangerous... Fuls suppressed the lost emotions and made the final decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, her behavior has been slightly over the line, which made her not want to stay too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilston District, an upscale hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stood behind the convex window and quietly admired the red moon and thin clouds at high altitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, he took care of the white hair of the horns and stretched out the curtains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he was busy moving the radio ticker back to the real world and pre-empting most of the taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he only waited for ten seconds, and he felt the room became gloomy and dark, and he heard the radio ticking sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein moved closer and saw a piece of illusory white paper spit out, written in Lunwen:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great master, please see the right!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the right... Klein turned his head in a funny and puzzled look Next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and placed a full-length mirror that had become dark and seemed to be painted with ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s thoughts just flashed, and the full-length mirror brightened, and there was an illusory fireworks in it that rushed into the air and fell. Gorgeous and gorgeous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, a row of golden Lunwen appeared in the center of the full-length mirror:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Welcome back, my great master!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, although "Magic Mirror" Arrods did not make a sound, but Klein felt that it was screaming Shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireworks subsided, the golden words twisted and reorganized, and a new text was formed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great master, your humble loyal servant Arrods wants to ask, Is there anything that can help you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is very accustomed to this and is proficient in speaking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Answer my question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold words reorganize again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Thank you for your answer, you can ask questions.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was prepared to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Where did the evil spirits in the underground ruins of Williams Street go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body mirror, the golden words solidified for a few seconds, slowly disappeared The background of the fireworks is blurred first, then clear, and transferred to another scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene is an abandoned chapel, full of withered vines, scattered with gray stones and feces left by birds and beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is quite familiar with this, and this is where he and Miss Sharon talked to the evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture was zoomed in. Klein saw a small, deep pit in the corner of the chapel half-collapsed, with obvious finger-slipping marks on the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Magician" mentioned this... Kline’s thoughts surged, and a cold and ridiculous voice came from the picture:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy cooperation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this sentence revealing the earth, the scene suddenly blurs and becomes a The water is disturbed and eventually broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy cooperation... Evil spirit Who is talking about who is happy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An angel polymer that allows a "hunter" approach to speak in this tone, the opposite person should not be low, or even reach the angel level. However, why did He use his hands to dig holes? He should have more ways to be more relaxed and not waste time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angel itself is also restricted? Well, like the old grandfather in Leonard's body? By the way, Leonard was at Beckland! This is a clue, but there are other possibilities. The angel step is not equal to the angel...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the evil spirit manipulate Pound from the baron? In this way, the insults of Intis and Fossack are the smoke bombs deliberately put into the evil spirits. It is worthy of being a "conspirator"... Klein’s mind flashed one idea after another, turning to the mirror "Arrods Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second question, I have three family members now, who do you think is more appropriate?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden Lunes words appear one after another:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you choose Ribak and Walter, you can have some extra The expansion of Asnia is the most professional and the most 'ordinary'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm...from the two families of the Duke of Nigan and the Viscounts of Conrad Sure enough, there was an extra expansion... Kline thought about it and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have asked questions."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the golden words suddenly poured out a bunch:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great master, what do you think of me as a housekeeper? You can take me from the steam church Come, I can be the best housekeeper in the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein hesitated for a second and euphemistically replied:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet suitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden words on the full-length mirror become bleak, and immediately illuminate, creeping and reorganizing :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your loyal and humble servant Arrods will be patient Waiting. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
