			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help? Klein silently thought about the word, and it was a bit embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sharon took over the three-day entrustment to protect him, although he mainly looked at the face of the Golden Pound, a strong 5 player was willing to pick up Such a task is itself a matter of small probability, which can be encountered by chance, but it cannot be forced to obtain it. In addition, when Klein is in a state of self-help, a panic that is not willing to let go, can get this. There are a lot of people at the level to help, even if the other party is for money, it is also a bit grateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it only ends here. He will not rush into the dangerous situation of not understanding the situation and not knowing his own strength and situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s original idea was that the occultal knowledge of the little "Sun" could basically confirm that it was before the Cataclysm, and that the ancient gods and the current seven were in control. There seems to be no coincidence between God and evil spirits. The entire mysterious system must be greatly different from the current one. Therefore, even if he knows the detailed content, he does not dare to try it rashly. It must be verified by the side to know which ones. It can also be used and which ones have no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like the previous sacrifice ceremony. Klein has clearly figured out the specific process from the "Sun" and has to wait until Mr. Azick’s reply. Dare to experiment, so as not to cause any unexpected changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "upside down" belongs to the character of the storm church bishop or team leader, and the occult knowledge that can be mastered is not less, but The problem is that this is too prejudicial, too much involved in the realm of the storm, not necessarily suitable for Klein use - not all rituals can be prayed to themselves by themselves, and pray for themselves Consider the spiritual burden that you can afford. Based on these factors, Klein turned his attention to Sharon and Maric, members of the original secret organization. The occult knowledge they know is often more suitable for the reference of wild people. And there will be a lot of partial, strange, but effective enough content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is not to say that he will give up the action of exchanging relevant content from the "sun" and "downside down", an ancient legacy, one An orthodox, a secretive, unorthodox, add up to a comprehensive, deeper mysterious knowledge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Klein is craving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never forgot that his ultimate goal is to return to the earth, so the more occult knowledge, the better, the more comprehensive the better, the deeper the better! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the premise of pursuing this goal is to kill Ins. Zangweier, for the captain to revenge for myself... Klein looks to Sharon and Maric, the corner of his mouth is slightly upturned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I must know what you need to help me to consider whether to agree."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't, can't make fun of my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon light wearing a black cap Nodded lightly and recognized Kline's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric sitting on the other side leaned forward and clenched his fists to the lower mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We originally belonged to a relatively old secret organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This I guessed... Klein maintains a serious and serious expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The organization formed in the early fifth period, the wind and waves formed in the raging sea cut off the north and south continents, formed in the highland kingdom of the southern continent, the kingdom of Perth, However, this is just a form, the source of this organization can even be traced back to the Quaternary, dating back to the Cataclysm." The pale-looking Maric continues to describe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also know that the "Rose School"...the earliest should be traced back to the different kings... Klein puts on a listening gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric caught a little messy hair:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This organization believes in a Evil gods believe that magic is the science and art of changing things through their own will, and this requires the establishment of a religious ritual system, including order and law. Well, before the invasion of the northern continents, they were in the Perth Valley. And the star plateau is an orthodox organization alongside the Church of the Death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“At the same time, they believe that their will is mainly from a variety of desires, which, combined with extraordinary power, can accomplish all kinds of incredible things.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of these ideas, they retain the ancient and bloody primitive ritual traditions, including stripping the human skin, making the pillars, and using the children's skull as a ceremonial artifact, allowing a large number of believers to release their desires wildly."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can't accept those cruel things, and think they have a big problem with the treatment of desires, so find an opportunity to escape the organization."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a problem with the treatment of desire?" Klein knew that the "Rose School" was famous for its bloody sacrifices and was not very curious about the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light gold hair, Sharon’s voice in the black court dress replied faintly and illusoryly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Their approach is indulgence and burning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our philosophy is repression and moderation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; &nbsp; This way... Klein suddenly thought of the description of the sequence of "Prisoners", the cage of the heart, the world is the cage of the body, the madness is bound, and the desire is suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Rose School does have a different approach to "Prisoners," Miss Sharon’s ideas are clearly more in line with the needs of the play, and why other members cannot see What about this? No, it should be... He frowned slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his reaction, he thought that he did not understand Maric’s hoarse voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are influenced by the evil spirits, and the desire to indulge helps to increase their will. Many people's indulgence can affect each other, add fanaticism, and let the state climb to the peak."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And our view is just the opposite. We believe that desire must always be suppressed in the heart, just like the flames and magma of the earth, until the critical moments complete the explosion, generating the power of terror. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, it is the difference between the chaotic system and the abstinence system... The influence of the evil spirit and the requirements of its own path are somewhat contrary, and it feels a little bit No, Klein turned thoughtfully and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you fled to Beckland, and now they are chasing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dead in the alley is involved in this matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We didn't let him get involved, it was his own involvement because of other things." Maric refuted the latter guess, defaulting to the previous words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why don’t you flee directly from Beckland? There are still many big cities in the coastal areas of the Kingdom of Lun and in the Bay of Desi, and you can go to Intis, to Fossac, to Fenetport, to countries such as Rømberg and Marcy. Well...that is, do you have reasons to leave Beckland? What could it be? Klein thought for a moment: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I probably understand, um, what do you need help?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My sequence is not high, I don't know what awesome extraordinary people can't directly confront that secret organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the "Divination" route sequence 7, the sequence 6 and the sequence 5 potion formula, and after killing Lalhous, Klein himself is not necessarily required to stay in Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still has a big gap with the next revenge object Ins. Zangweierga seal "0-08", there is no any short time The hope of success is not even close, so it is not impossible to leave Beckland. At most, it is a distress to pay for the prepaid rent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Klein still stays in this metropolis is because the most extraordinary people here have the most materials and resources, which is the most convenient place to upgrade. The revelation gained from divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become a "no face", after digesting almost, I got a glimpse of the sea, looking for a mermaid... Klein suddenly flashed such an idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon in a black court dress replied calmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
