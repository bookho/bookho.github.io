He turned to the second floor and stepped on the wooden steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the excitement, the drunks dispersed, and Captain Allan and others returned to the upper level unaffected and continued to play cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took this opportunity and followed the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to "flying fish and wine", not for the harm of non-existence against "white shark", purely wanting to be associated with this pirate force The bar owner knows more about the information. After all, he named German for the new identity. The hidden meaning is to hunt the bloody pirates and replace the "squirming hunger" with their spirit, flesh and extraordinary characteristics. The person to be released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The port of Damir has no gas resources, the aisle on the second floor is quite dim, and the brass candlesticks on the sides of the walls are swaying and faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein observed the environment while stretching his hand and rubbing it on his face, silently turning into a guard on the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the difference in clothing decoration, he made up for the ability to create hallucinations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be prepared, he walked toward the "White Shark" Hamilton room in the spiritual intuition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first passed the place where the cards were played, and did not attract anyone’s attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to the guards of the channel and consciously stopped and lowered the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "There is something downstairs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The storm is on, what happened tonight?" A guard sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that those who don't get hurt." Another guard said a little worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He refers to the prostitutes who are attached to the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are fine." Klein crossed the guard and came to the front of the "White Shark" and raised his hand in a cautious manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Hamilton asked with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Boss, it is me, there is a situation downstairs!" Klein recalled the address information he had just seen when he was watching the excitement, deliberately hoarse and vocal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Hamilton snorted. "Come on what happened!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein twisted his handle and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he closed the door, he lifted the illusion, his face muscles squirmed and changed back to the previous identity - blonde blue eyes, ordinary new passengers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Hamilton first glimpsed, then opened his mouth and tried to shout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he showed a piece of illusory fish scales on his back, and the body of the tall and obese body swelled again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his heartbeat speeded up, and the strong fear from instinct caught his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he felt that the stranger standing by the door was a demon who had been hungry for many days, and he was looking back and forth with his cold and eager eyes. soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the "White Shark" Hamilton was in a state of extreme panic and was unable to respond effectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walked slowly to the sofa and sat down, politely laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of being stared at by the horror monster disappeared, and Hamilton became relaxed. His body was like a puncture balloon, and he dried up a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is no longer recklessly calling for help, and his forehead is sweating and asks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you? What do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A hunter." Klein replied casually. "I heard that you have connections with many pirate forces. I want to know the corresponding Situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't have..." "White Shark" Hamilton subconsciously denied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately felt the madness to the extreme hunger, only the opposite man’s eyes seemed to have a dark red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein considers the next person in his heart, Sven laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have two One choice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One is to answer frankly, the second is to be killed by me, and then, frankly answer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Killing Psychic? "White Shark" Hamilton has heard of similar rumors and has difficulty swallowing saliva:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you want to know about these situations? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a hunter, I am chasing a bounty . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamilton suddenly felt that the other person's polite smile was full of incomprehensible madness, and couldn't help but blurt out:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, are you crazy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen a lot of similar adventurers, but all are buried in the sea!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is not difficult to hunt a pirate alone, but can you guard against subsequent retaliation? The prostitute in the bar looks like an ordinary customer, maybe a pirate informant! Your friendly associates will be bought at any time, giving you a shot! The pirates will also collect intelligence in advance to contain the boats you are riding. Can you protect all the passengers? Can you survive in the bombardment of a cannon in the sea that cannot escape? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one breath, venting his inner fear, he saw the man who claimed to be the hunter once again had a gentle smile of Sven:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After killing, there will be no such problems. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The real madman..."White Shark" Hamilton took a breath:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have connections with many pirates, but they are all passive. The cash, jewelry, and goods they need to sell need to be sold. They need to be replaced with spirits, food, fresh water, weapons, and women's comfort. But I can only wait for them here, not sure where their ships are driving, what are the recent goals. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still? Klein asked quietly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer he had just made was mainly to scare the "white shark". As for the revenge of the pirates, he was not worried at all. As a "faceless person", if it is so easy to find, it is better to find a place to sink from the bottom of the sea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and..."White Shark" Hamilton’s throat squirmed and did not immediately make a positive or negative description.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his mouth and looked at the gentleman wearing a half-high silk hat, with the other Calm and introverted as if looking at the crazy eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disturbing silence is like the sea before the storm, gently echoing, colliding, fermenting Finally, Hamilton removed his gaze and sullenly held his hand on the table in front of him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am still collecting news for them. If there is urgent information, I will use the radio station they gave to remind them. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Radio?" Klein, who succeeded in the game, captured a noun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the name they told me, similar to the telegram, but does not require a line." Hamilton turned and walked to the gray-white safe and squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radio? Are pirates so high-tech? Klein vaguely guessed what the other party said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once thought about inventing something similar. The result was that the corresponding magazine had already known that the radio newspaper had already appeared, but it has not yet found itself in the commercial field. The location - the violent sea separating the north and south continents, lightning and thunder, the magnetic field is disordered, the storm is plundering, only a few passages can pass, even if equipped with a radiotelegraph, it has almost no effect, the same, the foggy sea, Sunia The weather in the sea is changing violently, and there are many factors affecting electromagnetic propagation. The application of radiotelegraphs is greatly limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there an improvement that can solve some problems? Klein looked at the "white shark" and opened the floor in front of the safe. By twisting the device, a secret door appeared on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theft is a hidden cabinet divided into three compartments. There are some documents and bills on the top, and there are revolvers in the middle, new half-arms and other weapons. Stuffed with complicated black machinery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just glanced at it and judged that the mechanical creation belonged to the radio station through the impression of the previous life and the information collected before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is this thing, they call this radio station, the news can be received by the similar things in the Rothde Islands, and the weather must be seen further. By luck, usually, it is also very troublesome, and many restrictions." Hamilton is not too understanding, according to the accepted teaching and experience, vaguely describes the corresponding situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the new radio station that is currently being commercialized...I don’t know who invented it... Klein listened quietly and asked directly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are they?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He makes himself behave like a bounty hunter who doesn’t understand technology . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Shark" Hamilton wiped the cold sweat on his forehead:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Professing to be the 'Dawn 'The owner of the 'silver coin snake' Odell, and the 'blood admiral' intelligence officer, Old Quinn, they appeared together, I can not confirm whether they are cooperating, of course, Odell has always only declared." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of "Dawn", the "mysterious queen"? Klein took back his sight and didn't know when he had more gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold coins continued to roll between the fingers, and finally jumped into the air, and fell down, seeing that the "white shark" is unknown, so wary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down, Klein slowly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he suddenly asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who gave you the potion ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old, old Quinn..." Hamilton hesitated or chose to confess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded lightly, no longer asked, and turned to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! The wooden door opened and closed, and the figure wearing a black coat disappeared into the room of the White Shark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamilton held his breath, waited for a dozen seconds, and finally sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly wiped off the sweat on his face, moved the radio to the table, flipped out a codebook, and rushed to take a telegram to the distance:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was stared at!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfamiliar guy! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the side of Hamilton, Klein put his hands in his pockets and watched quietly, taking the contents of the band spectrum and the codebook into full view.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
