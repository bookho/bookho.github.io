			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;False eyelashes lying on the floor of the living room shook a few times, the eyes slowly opened, and the moon was seen hanging high above the window. In the past, the blushing crepe of the blush was turned into a rich blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not dead, not out of control...I was not dreaming...I really have a mysterious and powerful "fool" who saved me...Fuls turned over From the point of view, I found that in addition to the hair has become longer and more dense, there are no other abnormalities in the rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But my life is completely different than before... I don’t know if this is good or bad..." Silently, Foer Thinking about sitting on the ground like this, holding out the gods, sometimes screaming, sometimes screaming, sometimes sad, sometimes stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, Klein looked at the symbol behind it as " The chair of the layered door, thoughtfully whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what the slang contains..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When she has sequence 7, or sequence 6, she should be able to counter the negative effects and hear the contents of the slang."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If she hasn't mastered the 'playing method', let Miss 'Justice' help me to teach me. I use the sacred object as a basis to swear to the goddess. I can't understand the 'playing the law'. A similar thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...When I promoted the sequence 5, I became a 'secret master', maybe with the help of the corresponding ritual and this mysterious space Remotely manipulate her, directly see the scene she saw, and hear the sound she heard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That can confirm whether it is the 'door'. ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a gentleman who has witnessed the history of the Quaternary. It is probably older than Mr. Azke who has lived forever. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if his strength and level are equivalent to a sequence, 2? or even 1?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Considering for a while, he felt spiritual instability, and he fell into the fog and returned to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a normal phenomenon that has not been promoted for a long time, so Kline gave up his intention to go out, patience at home to meditate, and to dissipate the spirituality of distraction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, Firth took the first steam train and returned St. George's District, then transferred to the public carriage, arrived at the two-bedroom room where she and Hugh lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just opened the door and she suddenly found that she would sleep very late and had a toast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a bloody moon suddenly last night, which made me feel a little sleepy, I woke up very early, Fols, how are you not? Did the strange proverb become stronger?" Hugh raised his head and asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folse’s gaze suddenly blurred, she turned her head to look aside, smirked her smile, and used the usual tone of the other’s voice:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your brain? Didn't I say that? When bloody, the slang will definitely become stronger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This has no effect on me, um, no effect, you see me, now more spirit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, give me a piece of bread!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you not love this kind of eating?" He took care of his short blond hair and whispered a whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete the initial revenge and get a promotion to Klein I slept until dawn, and I went out to buy a fee for the breakfast inside the Porter, and served a Dixi pie with a cup of sweet iced tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meet the perfect food, he put down the knife and fork, picked up the newspaper, and started reading very relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sweeping, he found that the headline of the Tasok newspaper reads:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Blood moon night, murderer reappears!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come again? Klein was busy flipping the front pages of other newspapers and saw a lot of similar headlines:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The real 11th! The police are helpless!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cold-blooded murderer once again provokes the police!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The atmosphere of panic is pervading the Baekeland De!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...the night and the punters are definitely a headache? Klein felt a heartfelt feeling in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, he has the urge to grab the murderer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the earth, he is incapable of imagining himself to uphold justice and punish evil scenes, and now, as the extraordinary person of sequence 7 Klein felt that he would not be a superhero and he was sorry for the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, unfortunately, this case has received a lot of attention. I will mix it in, isn’t waiting to reveal my identity? To be a man, you still have to be sensible... And, according to the "Sun" classmates, the murderer is likely to be in the sequence of the sequence of 6 liters. I have won so many spells and spell-like abilities, although I am not afraid of him, but it may not be Can catch him, the risk is high... After thinking about it, Klein still chose to follow the strongest thoughts inside and be an ordinary citizen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that with the strength of several churches, if the murderer continues to commit crimes, it may not be small! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the relevant news, Klein took a closer look at the Beckland Morning Post and found that the fifth edition reappeared the advertisement of Ernst Commercial Bank’s acquisition of goods. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be a party at 8 o'clock tomorrow night, just in time, you can sell the medullary crystal of the Elven Fountain to the pharmacist..." Klein whispered, remembering all The first four digits of the quote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, he read the thick pile of newspapers in front of him and seriously thought about his future plans:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The long-term plan is to raise the sequence of the promotion, become the strong man of the demigod and the half, and plan for revenge on Ings Zangweier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The medium-term plan is to find a way to play the 'magician', gradually sum up the corresponding code, and digest the potion a little. In this process, collect the characteristics of the human skin that the 'no face' needs. Deep sea Naga hair, thousands of face hunters have different pituitary and blood, and how to remove the evil spirits in the object."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm...sequence 6 levels of extraordinary materials, each about 1,500 pounds, really expensive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, get a magical item of partial attack or control, 'magic Although the teacher is very strong, but the extraordinary ability is more concentrated in life, escape, adapt to the environment, the strongest attack is equivalent to a special left Pistols, just wins unexpectedly, and lack the means to control the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Short-term plan, short-term plan... Oh, wait for the paper cut" People's, ready for the ability to play, go to the circus in the afternoon, both as relaxation and entertainment, and by looking at the ordinary magician performance to find the inspiration, um, I read the newspaper, Bakerland has several fixed The circus..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After clearing the idea, Klein immediately cleaned up the plate, cleaned the knife and fork, and put in a busy preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near noon, he put down his scissors and looked at the three rough paper people in front of him, sighed and whispered: <br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is probably the first time I have been doing this manually for the first time in my life..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately, just the paper-cutters It’s not a window cut, it’s not an embroidery, it’s a personal shape!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey, if my hands have become dexterous, I’m afraid I will fail today... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Klein has just tried the ability with additional paper people and confirmed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folding the paper man and hiding it in a stack of notes, Klein puts them away and puts them in their pockets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
