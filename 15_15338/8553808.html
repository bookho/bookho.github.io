			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;False eyelashes lying on the floor of the living room shook a few times, the eyes slowly opened, and the moon was seen hanging high above the window. In the past, the blushing crepe of the blush was turned into a rich blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not dead, not out of control...I was not dreaming...I really have a mysterious and powerful "fool" who saved me...Fuls turned over From the point of view, I found that in addition to the hair has become longer and more dense, there are no other abnormalities in the rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But my life is completely different than before... I don’t know if this is good or bad..." Silently, Foer Thinking about sitting on the ground like this, holding out the gods, sometimes screaming, sometimes screaming, sometimes sad, sometimes stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, Klein looked at the symbol behind it as " The chair of the layered door, thoughtfully whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what the slang contains..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When she has sequence 7, or sequence 6, she should be able to counter the negative effects and hear the contents of the slang."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If she hasn't mastered the 'playing method', let Miss 'Justice' help me to teach me. I use the sacred object as a basis to swear to the goddess. I can't understand the 'playing the law'. A similar thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...When I promoted the sequence 5, I became a 'secret master', maybe with the help of the corresponding ritual and this mysterious space Remotely manipulate her, directly see the scene she saw, and hear the sound she heard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That can confirm whether it is the 'door'. ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a gentleman who has witnessed the history of the Quaternary. It is probably older than Mr. Azke who has lived forever. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if his strength and level are equivalent to a sequence, 2? or even 1?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Considering for a while, he felt spiritual instability, and he fell into the fog and returned to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a normal phenomenon that has not been promoted for a long time, so Kline gave up his intention to go out, patience at home to meditate, and to dissipate the spirituality of distraction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, Firth took the first steam train and returned St. George's District, then transferred to the public carriage, arrived at the two-bedroom room where she and Hugh lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just opened the door and she suddenly found that she would sleep very late and had a toast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a bloody moon suddenly last night, which made me feel a little sleepy, I woke up very early, Fols, how are you not? Did the strange proverb become stronger?" Hugh raised his head and asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folse’s gaze suddenly blurred, she turned her head to look aside, smirked her smile, and used the usual tone of the other’s voice:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your brain? Didn't I say that? When bloody, the slang will definitely become stronger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This has no effect on me, um, no effect, you see me, now more spirit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, give me a piece of bread!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you not love this kind of eating?" He took care of his short blond hair and whispered a whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete the initial revenge and get a promotion to Klein I slept until dawn, and I went out to buy a fee for the breakfast inside the Porter, and served a Dixi pie with a cup of sweet iced tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a glance, he found that the front page of the Tasok newspaper read: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood Moon Night, killer reappears!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you here? Klein was busy flipping the front pages of other newspapers and saw a lot of similar headlines:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The real 11th! The police are helpless!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cold-blooded murderer once again provokes the police!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The atmosphere of panic is pervading the Baekeland De!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...the night and the punters are definitely a headache? Klein felt a heartfelt feeling in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, he has the urge to grab the murderer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the earth, he is incapable of imagining himself to uphold justice and punish evil scenes, and now, as the extraordinary person of sequence 7 Klein felt that he would not be a superhero and he was sorry for the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, unfortunately, this case has received a lot of attention. I will mix it in, isn’t waiting to reveal my identity? To be a man, you still have to be sensible... And, according to the "Sun" classmates, the murderer is likely to be in the sequence of the sequence of 6 liters. I have won so many spells and spell-like abilities, although I am not afraid of him, but it may not be Can catch him, the risk is high... After thinking about it, Klein still chose to follow the strongest thoughts inside and be an ordinary citizen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that with the strength of several churches, if the murderer continues to commit crimes, it may not be small! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the relevant news, Klein took a closer look at the Beckland Morning Post and found that the fifth edition reappeared the advertisement of Ernst Commercial Bank’s acquisition of goods. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be a party at 8 o'clock tomorrow night, just in time, you can sell the medullary crystal of the Elven Fountain to the pharmacist..." Klein whispered, remembering all The first four digits of the quote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, he read the thick pile of newspapers in front of him and seriously thought about his future plans:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The long-term plan is to raise the sequence of the promotion, become the strong man of the demigod and the half, and plan for revenge on Ings Zangweier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The medium-term plan is to find a way to play the 'magician', gradually sum up the corresponding code, and digest the potion a little. In this process, collect the characteristics of the human skin that the 'no face' needs. Deep sea Naga hair, thousands of face hunters have different pituitary and blood, and how to remove the evil spirits in the object."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm...sequence 6 levels of extraordinary materials, each about 1,500 pounds, really expensive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, get a magical item of partial attack or control, 'magic Although the teacher is very strong, but the extraordinary ability is more concentrated in life, escape, adapt to the environment, the strongest attack is equivalent to a special left Pistols, just wins unexpectedly, and lack the means to control the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Short-term plan, short-term plan... Oh, wait for the paper cut" People's, ready for the ability to play, go to the circus in the afternoon, both as relaxation and entertainment, and by looking at the ordinary magician performance to find the inspiration, um, I read the newspaper, Bakerland has several fixed The circus..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After clearing the idea, Klein immediately cleaned up the plate, cleaned the knife and fork, and put in a busy preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near noon, he put down his scissors and looked at the three rough paper people in front of him, sighed and whispered: <br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is probably the first time I have been doing this manually for the first time in my life..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately, just the paper-cutters It’s not a window cut, it’s not an embroidery, it’s a personal shape!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey, if my hands have become dexterous, I’m afraid I will fail today... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After folding the paper man and hiding it in a stack of notes, Klein put them away and put them in their pockets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he was going to go out to a better restaurant to enjoy the food, and then to the nearest circus to watch the performance, the doorbell was suddenly sounded, and the sound of the jingle was sweet. Reverberate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Delegation? The advertisement I posted should be off the shelf..." Klein came to the door wearing a necklined shirt and a thin, warm sweater. On the side, hold the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the image of the visitor naturally appears in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is one A man of nearly forty years old is quite fat, and standing there seems to be quite difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are squeezed by the meat on his face, the skin is rough but very white, with a gentleman's stick in his hand and a very top on his head. Very tall hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Beckland in October has been said to be cold, the man’s forehead is clearly sweating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two waiters wearing bright red coats next to him, who are holding him from right to left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not know... Klein sighed and opened the door in the absence of his own inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, this weather is really hot." The obese middle-aged man took out his handkerchief and wiped the sweat from his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While he was talking, a cold wind blew, blowing the two waiters next to him to tremble a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, may I ask if you have anything?" Klein asked politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are Sherlock. Moriarty Detective? I have something to entrust." The middle-aged man smiled reluctantly. "Forget yourself introduced. I am Logo Carman, a jeweler."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please come in." Klein smiled and let the road open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luoge Caroman stepped heavily into the room and sat down on the sofa, letting the furniture of some years have resisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is it?" Klein took out a copper penny and skillfully let it roll and spin at the fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logo sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want you to protect my child until tomorrow In the afternoon, he got some madness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Until tomorrow afternoon? You found a solution? Why not call the police?" Klein is not fast or slow. Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logo silently for two seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yatru met several bad friends They were led by them to do something bad, um, not too serious, but they will go to jail, there is no other way, I don’t want to call the police."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He recently fell out with those bad friends, and the whole person suddenly collapsed and kept licking those people to kill him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am very worried, so I asked the security company to ask six senior security personnel to be vigilant outside, and then hired four private detectives, followed by Atro, taking turns to watch."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But one of the detectives suddenly had something out there and needed to return tomorrow afternoon. I had to ask another one temporarily."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, you can only hire you for one day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... pay £10, if you are in danger, I will add another plus It will definitely satisfy you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way... 10 pounds a day, equivalent to Mr. Somer’s salary for more than a week... Klein from the other side The emotional color initially confirmed that he did not lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
