			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as the high-altitude violent breath flew over, Anderson’s chewing action stopped, until the other side stayed away, only swallowed the remaining rabbit meat and looked up at Geer. Man Sparrow:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the dragon you said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein’s position was not too big, confirming Anderson’s guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson’s mouth is slowly tilted, revealing the expression that I don’t know how to cry or laugh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought that you are talking about adult and even young dragons, just now...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I probably can't be a dragon hunter, I can only do dragon faeces. . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "King of the North" that madness and tyranny is indeed a bit scary, than the patchwork monster that can make the hair grow wildly in the "Future" I don't know how strong... Maybe, it has a sequence of 4, a half-god level... Klein calmly judges in his heart, without any panic and fear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He remembers very clearly, "Growser Travels" clearly stated that the pirate lady suffered the "King of the North" attack, tried her best to escape, and met the protagonist led by giant Grosser.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Edwina Edwards is obviously not a demigod, belongs to the sequence of the "reader" route, and is inconvenient because it is suddenly swallowed into the book. The magical items or seals that are carried for a long time are left in the captain's room, and there are only one or two items available for use.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, she can Initially contending with the "King of the North", survived, just got promoted and adjusted the glove configuration of Clay There is no big problem with self-question, and he can connect with the fog and respond with the "Poseidon Scepter"!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Klein’s courage The reason for direct entry after confirming the normal state of Deniz prayer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the "King of the North" is not like the demigod on the normal route, according to "Iceberger Lieutenant" said that it is a runaway monster that gathers many of the extraordinary features of the frost. It can be comparable to the demigod in certain areas, and other aspects must be flawed... I, Edwina, Anderson, plus the protagonist The extraordinary people of the team, there is no way to solve it! It is not good, but also the above "Poseidon Scepter", I do not believe that this book can prevent the items above the fog in advance, if it can, it has already shown performance... Standing next to the fire, Klein looked down at Anderson and opened his mouth: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you afraid?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson stunned for a second and said with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not afraid, you seem Very confident. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he looked at Daniz, who was still a little shuddering and trying to calm his emotions, and snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what is most important for men? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi just took a deep breath, heard the words, and did not surely take the right index finger and middle finger, pointing to the bottom. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson blinked and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Bastard, you are really a Vulgar pirates! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, what I just wanted to say, haha, I can’t remember!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, what I want to say is courage. The most important thing for men is courage. If you look at you, the dragons have not yet attacked, and they are scared to hurry! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz's face suddenly turned red and glared at each other.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tos Carter, you are not doing this... Klein couldn’t help but swear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi is about to declare that he is simply affected by the breath of high creatures. Suddenly remembered a certain sentence, the expression immediately returned to normal, responded in an understatement: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have no comparison with the dragon's stool. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson smiled and froze, coughing twice, pulling off a rabbit leg without anything happening, handing it to German Sparrow:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Try it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein silenced for a few seconds, slowly shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a strange world. It's best not to eat any food here until you have confirmed that there is no problem.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe just a piece of rabbit meat, it will let you stay forever it's here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Anderson put the roasted rabbit legs in front of the nose and mouth, and slowly let go, and the expression was a little bit smashed. "Why? Not to say earlier? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein calmly responded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just thought about this." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson's expression was distorted for a few seconds, his head lowered, and the baked rabbit legs were quickly picked up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You, don't you really have problems? "The action of the strongest hunter made Deniz stunned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson smiled helplessly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I have already eaten one before, and the digestion has also been digested... Anyway, I can't change it, it's better to concentrate on it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and Daniz could not find a language response at this moment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson After finishing the rabbit leg, I asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really don't eat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how much time it will take. If I can't get enough, what can I do to fight a monster like the dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not answer directly, took out the gold shell pocket watch, and glanced at it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Outside time, evening 6 Point 10 points.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After 4 to 6 hours, if there is no problem with your status, we can eat a small amount. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Anderson opened his mouth and couldn’t speak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Ryan didn't pay attention to him and turned to Daniz Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A break for a quarter of an hour, then go find your captain. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he has taken out the pearl earrings belonging to "Iceberg Lieutenant" Edwina Edwards.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. "Daniz suddenly felt that his blood was boiling, completely forgetting the cold outside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seven or eight seconds, he shrank in the direction of the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside time, at 7 o'clock in the evening, Klein pressed the hat, With a cane, along with Daniz and Anderson, according to the divination, all the way to a mountain peak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a piece of thick ice The huge rock, they saw a black secluded cave, and there was a woman guard standing with a bow and arrow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman has a soft glow Black hair, and tied it into a simple ponytail, the facial features are very soft, different from those in all countries of the North Continent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is wearing a brown ancient The hunter's coat and trousers were inspired to cast their gaze.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing her slightly pointed ears, combined with Grosell Tour Klein immediately knew her identity: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female elf who first met the giant Grosser, the name is unknown.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If compared with the Earth, the people of the Northland are closer to the European and American style, this elf has a distinct oriental charm... Klein quickly summed up the characteristics.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elves! She is exactly the same as the elves in some ancient religious paintings!" Anderson suddenly excited. "I have to discuss with her, ask her to be my model, let me paint some pictures for her!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next to Daniz listened with a sneer, succinctly swearing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vulgar!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, he did not forget the ridicule of Anderson before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you only know that kind of painting?" Anderson glanced at him, stepping up and heading for the female elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was just approaching, and the female elf did not hesitate to raise his longbow, and the arrow above it flashed with silver electric light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" Anderson immediately raised his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Useless, most of the elves are in the "storm" way, it is easy to be violent and rash... Klein quietly opened the "spirit of the spirit", intends Use the initial control method to let the elf calmly listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Anderson had a flower in front of him, saw two thick and strong gray-blue giant legs, and a terrible giant sword with snow inserted. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Anderson suddenly found himself only a little higher than the knee of the leg, instinctively following the lines of the giant sword, looking up a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the state of leaning back, he finally saw the giant in front of the four-meter-high! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant's complexion is gray-blue, with thick beast fur wrapped between the chest and abdomen and the lumbosacral, and the rest is bare, and even the feet lack protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squats with a giant sword that is wider than the human door, and looks down at Anderson and Klein with the iconic vertical one-eyed eye.道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why come to the camp in Grossel? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was about to answer, and a huge figure in the dark and faint cave suddenly came out of a familiar figure, and Daniz’s eyes were filled with ecstasy.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Iceberg Lieutenant" Edwina wearing a complex shirt and dark trousers swept through the three of them, and the seemingly cold expression appeared more obvious Wrong, it seems that Galman Sparo and Anderson Hood will be here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly returned to normal, looking up to the giant:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grosser, this is my companion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grosser opened his mouth and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are also coming Dealing with Ulysian? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysian? Klein didn't know what to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he saw Edwina standing in the shadow of the giant to give himself a look and make a positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysian is equal to "King of the North"? Klein replied thoughtfully: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, Then we are friends!" Grosser looked down at the opposite three, haha ​​laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while he spoke, Anderson quietly returned to the side of the German Sparrow, slamming the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The first time I saw a living giant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This simply can't hit his key, too high. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can give him a pedicure... Klein spoke a word and responded plainly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" A huge goal means easy hits. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
