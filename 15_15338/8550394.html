			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fingers of the five joints whitish cold and painfully clasped the wrist, and Klein instantly stood up and shook hands, subconsciously pulling his hands, frantically I want to retire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy feeling came, and Klein used all his strength to pull his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale, naked body was pulled up and slanted from the long table to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the cold, pale fingers still clasped Klein’s wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein lost his ability to think for a moment, and his mind was full of ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, because he couldn’t get it back, he lost his black cane and worked hard several times to get the revolver out of his gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the eyelids of the corpse were lifted up, revealing a pair of blue eyelids without focal length. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He screams and whispers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honakis...Honach斯...Honakis..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three sounds, Klein, who was in a hurry, felt the fingers holding his wrists begin to loosen, then they It is impossible to hang down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the tuxedo clown are heavy and tight, and nothing seems to have happened before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not a pale body lying on a stone floor, Klein might think he had an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a few steps back and felt that many parts of his body were stunned by frightening and nervous fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call...Call... Klein gasped and slowly recovered his ability to think, alert and fearfully looking at the body on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the revolver and carefully quit the room step by step, confirming that the body had no movements before aiming at the wrist of his gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five deep, dark red fingerprints that are silently telling the previous encounters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein calmed down a lot, and his heart kept echoing a swearing word:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;艹Fucking , scared to death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a tenth of a second, he began to sketch things in his mind and get himself to get a cool state quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall carefully, Klein "replays" a frame of the previous encounter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he still doesn't understand the reason why the tuxedo clown "corpse change", but he is keenly aware of the key point, that is, the other party repeatedly whispered "Honakis"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s Hornaces...” Klein frowned. “The Antigone family’s notes document the Hornachs Mountains. The night country, when I heard the sound that should not be heard in meditation and spiritual vision, there is also the term 'Honakis', and now the dead man has once again emphasized Honach in my ear. Sri Lanka... Is the answer to many questions in the Hornacs Mountains... Perhaps there may be huge dangers there, such as a certain evil spirit being sealed in the mountains, seeking similar relief through a similar 'temptation'." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thoughts were mixed, Klein carefully entered the room, touched the body a few times, confirming that the other party has died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that he couldn’t let the “collector” Frye see that he made a mess here, so he took the courage and moved his body back and shoulders. A long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole process, Klein has not only been holding his heart, but he may be nervous because of tiny movements, and it is cold by the body and his skin. The contact made it very disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The branding did not know when it fell off and condensed into a ball with a little blue blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood ball has only the size of the thumb, and it is suspended in the air in a posture that violates the physical rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Klein whispered, not afraid to touch it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never thought about leaving this strange blood cell, first because he didn’t know whether it was good or bad, and second, he believed that Frye had carefully examined the body. It must have been discovered the brand of the wrist, and may even know what the blood cell is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even if Frye is not clear, turn it over to the captain and let the entire night team explore and study, obviously it’s much better than my random attempt... Klein If you think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the organization, individuals must know how to make the most of the power of the organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein waited for a few minutes, and saw Frye, who had dark blue eyes and thin lips, returned to the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze was instantly attracted by the strange blood ball and asked what Klein had asked himself before:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Klein shook his head honestly and described the story without any concealment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The branding fell into blood cells..." Frye nodded as if thinking, "The body of the extraordinary will always have some strange changes..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and looked at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go to the captain and come over and The contents of the corpse whispered to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein had long wanted to leave this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to come with the captain." Frye added, "I don't think you really like seeing the next picture."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he picked up a silver-white scalpel next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has a lingering nod::<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly what I want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a cane, put on his hat, turned to the Chanis Gate, and saw the captain Dunn who was no longer languid in the duty room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den calmly listened to his narrative and slammed it invisibly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will Inform the matter and let the church handle it. Maybe they will send someone to the main peak of the Hornacs Mountains to see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein "Well" Once, I saw only the captain and the "sleepless" Cohenli in the duty room, so I asked one by one:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Ayre, have they gone to rest?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun nodded and nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ayr and Borgia in Santa Selena Church, Loro Tower should be looking for a coffee shop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Coffee? Ms. Lorota's injury should not be cured yet?" Klein was surprised. Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn licked the brows on both sides and smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luoluta has three Big hobbies, coffee, desserts and maids, she said that there must be these three things in order to accelerate recovery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maid?" Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have a certain aspect of Ms. Luo Luota? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She likes the maid, um, that's right, and likes it, likes the chest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...She is such a strange person." Klein I don't know what face to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down didn’t delay, went to the outdoor, Klein looked at his back, quietly waiting to turn around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he saw the "sleepless" Cohen Lie out of his pocket watch and pressed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, two, one... When Klein’s number was just over, Dunn stopped and turned halfway:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And forget one thing, Klein, you have experienced too much today, you will feel tired after you relax, you don’t have to stay here in the afternoon, go back to rest, tomorrow, submit your application tomorrow. The loss will be listed in detail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, killing the extraordinary, don't care, kill him, you will save more. People."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually, I am actually much better." Klein breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den’s slight decapitation, waiting to turn around, and slamming the forehead violently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "And, I have already handed the portrait of the extraordinary to Leonard, and let him and the police department take charge of the follow-up investigation. I think that the extraordinary person will definitely take a carriage in Tingen, enjoy the food, and be sure There will be places to live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where you walk, you will leave traces, and Russell’s words are really very reasonable."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes." Klein answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the captain went away, he also left the duty room and walked slowly to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, he suddenly thought of one thing, inexplicably a little more fear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The tuxedo clown claims that the secret master will master the sequence of the 'divination'... Even if it is exaggerated, they don’t have a high-sequence formula, and the low sequence is certainly not lacking.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, they have a lot of divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will it be divination is the tuxedo clown I killed, secretly Retaliation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no way to deal with the night, but I can't cope with a 'divination' that has no direct means of defeating the enemy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stopped on the stairs, seriously thought about the problem, and soon found himself worried:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, the Secret Society will not know what the members of the night are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second, even if you know one or two, it definitely does not contain This civilian staff."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Third, in this case, unless it is a 'prophet', it is impossible to divinate the murderer."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed and left the Black Thorns Security Company and returned to Daffodil Street in a public carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he didn’t eat anything at noon, he still lacks appetite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein entered the bedroom, took off the damaged dress, took off the half-height silk hat, and then lay down on the bed, trying to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His thoughts are still active, the whole person seems to be unable to relax, but the repetition in his mind is no longer the shooting of the tuxedo clown, but his own body The scene of the moment, but the creepy touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has lost a lot of discomfort for the first time killing, but a little more light is to think about the nausea after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This may be the purpose of Frye, I hope that I will face the psychological shadow by facing the body... However, the psychological shadow before it is gone, the new psychology The shadow appeared..." Klein laughed at himself and his spirit eased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
