			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legend of the treasures that inspired generations of adventurers to go out to sea, the chef also baked the meat on the belly of the fisherman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They reveal a white color, dyed a little black, covered with brown fine particles, flashing the moisturizing oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repeated application of the seasoning has penetrated into the texture of the meat, presenting an attractive visual effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dixi grilled fish, not quite the same as you often eat." Elland pointed to the white porcelain dish that the chef put down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donna presses the knife and fork and eagerly says:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My favorite honey roast Fish!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this is also very attractive. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honey-baked fish... How much honey do you have? There is a chance to try it, the taste should be good... Klein will think about it.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the chef, they don’t have to be hands-on, looking forward to watching the pieces of fish being cut, put them on different plates and pushing them in front of them.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is very serious about the attitude of enjoying food. He is not in a hurry to deal with fish. Instead, he first picks up the cup, drank the lipstick tea, and cleared the mouth with a slightly acidic liquid. The residual taste inside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he forked the piece of fish and stuffed it in the mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, he felt the slightly stimulating taste of cumin, basil and other spices, which fully opened the taste buds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The delicious juice, the salty scent of sea salt, the refreshing sweetness and sweetness of lemons, and the intertwined, reverberating in the mouth, seduce the spit.<br /><br <br><br><br><br /> ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein swallowed the fish in his mouth, recalled the food show that he had watched in his life, and selected an evaluation that best fits the feeling:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The sense of hierarchy is very good! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, your tone and words are like a foodie. "Alan made a joke.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna shook the fork in her hand and said, "Uncle, maybe you should open a column in the newspaper." , reviews different restaurants with different cuisines. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, why haven’t I thought of this idea... This is a good job to earn money and taste food! The only problem is obesity. People can't be flexible clowns... Use vomiting Dafa? That wastes food! Klein seriously considers the proposal of Donna.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For this beautiful night! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the food was running low, Ellan poured out the wine of Sunia and raised his face with a rosy face.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and others are equally intimately attached:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For this wonderful night. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have drunk the remaining liquid in the cup and watched the waiter clean up the table and clean the deck.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;In the cold wind, they talked for a while and talked about the mermaid that Danna was most interested in.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crevis told the little girl In some legends, the mermaid is also called the Kraken. They use the song to confuse human beings not for fun, but for hunting. Except for the path of the Gargas Islands to the depths of the Sunia Sea, humans may encounter this creature. Unexplored, there are certain opportunities in the seas full of dangers. However, this is due to the words of some pirates who are drunk and boasted. They all avoid the question of how they escaped the song of the mermaid. It is not worth it. Believe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Donna, Denton, it's time to go back. You have to get up early tomorrow and share breakfast with your parents." Cecil looked at the position of the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Donna stood up reluctantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denton hurriedly asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, do I have the opportunity to be an adventurer?" ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mind has been captured by previous hunting activities and those legends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crives walked over to him and patted him on the shoulder:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Before asking this question, you need at least five years of combat training and knowledge acquisition. I think your father will give you a good tutor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Um!" Danton's eyes lit up and nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five years, when you grow up, you will never want to be an adventurer who is buried at the bottom of the sea... The treatment of Krivis is very hot. Did not directly refuse, but give hope, let time rush, this will avoid the sudden rebellion of children! Anyway, master a fighting, for no harm to anyone... Klein hands into the pocket Thought to admire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way back to the interior of the cabin, Krivis handed two five-pound notes to Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has just received the £150 from Elland’s purchase of the entire fisherman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't do anything." Klein instinctively refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crivis swept him with a pale blue eye, saying low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have liberated Cecil and are optimistic about the children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the children? Klein wanted to laugh, but eventually took the two notes and drew a triangle on the chest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are more generous than I thought, thank you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer quits, suddenly wants to understand a problem, if he does not charge the 10 pounds, in the eyes of a senior adventurer like Reeves, Dissatisfied with the price, trying to get more, may attack them at any time - people who claim to be adventurers, the madman of greed is not a minority! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Greman. Sparo licked the banknote, and Krivis regained his gaze, and his expression was flat:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the rule of the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer said, following behind Cecil and Donna , entered the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If every single commission, every task, is this kind of difficulty, can have this kind of gain, I have long relied on private detectives to make a fortune. ... Klein laughed at himself and looked at the red moon at high altitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It still quietly and gently shines through the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legend of the sea, different monsters... I finally found the feeling of an adventurer." Klein turned and walked to the edge of the boat, bathed in a blushing light The yarn, admiring the farther and darker waves, gradually precipitated, and came out a little from the gloom of Bakerland's smog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ling and the wet wind patted his face, the vast and innocent ocean reflected his eyes, let his heart slowly open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, Klein had the urge to sing poetry, but after he opened his mouth, he found that he could not remember the corresponding modern verse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t always come to the sea, you are all water... The “generalist” sequence of the Great is really suitable for doing similar things. Looking through his collection of poems, lest it be illiterate... Kline looked at the red moon and the ocean with a sigh of relief: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After an unexpected loss, the exploration team returned to Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the cracked walls of the grass, Dairik was a bit embarrassed, as if he had been away for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His oblique rear, "Hunter" Colin eyes suddenly confused, raised his hand and pressed the right temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the players are filled with joy and relaxation from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a difficult exploration, having a destination and waiting for them at home is the best thing in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin’s gaze returned to normal, with a micro-side head looking obliquely forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, White House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After repeated thoughts, confident Emlin came to his parents and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If I want to delve into the history of our blood family, who should I look for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directly asking about Silver City, it is likely to expose my problem Although I am not afraid, I am very calm, but for the ancestor, in order to save the entire blood family, I can only choose to conceal... I have been interested in the history of the blood family, and collected a lot of information, Dad and Mom are very clear about this, will not Any doubt... this excuse is perfect! Emlin himself praised himself in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father is similar to him with five or six points, wearing pair of gold-rimmed glasses, which looks professional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman who really got a doctorate in medicine put down his thick Anatomy and pushed down the glasses:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Beckland, no one knows more than Nibes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......I dare to look for it Master Nibes had already gone... Emlin thought of the Savior's stance, described by Mr. Fool, carrying a secret and misunderstanding, and asked seriously: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "In addition to the adults of Nibes?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is sleeping in the ground, not convenient to be disturbed frequently. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin's father took the collar of a thick cotton pajamas and thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Wei Mandi, he always thinks he is a historian. "[< /> /> </ br> <br /> <br /> he. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistle sounds, the White Onyx sails into the port of Damir.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will add fresh water and food to this colonial island, the next day I set sail again in the morning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hunting the fisherman, Klein spent two days to say that leisurely, can also be said to be boring life, completely boring to the scenery at sea, I decided to go to the port bar tonight, hoping to get more mermaid information and find inspiration.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you encounter any bloody pirate coming ashore I will not learn the lesson. There is still a spirit waiting to be released in the "squirming hunger"... Klein put all the magical items on his body, sweating his forehead and leaving the cabin, down to the port.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, he met Donna and Krivis and others, they seem to go to the port restaurant to taste Damir's most famous cured meat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna and Denton’s parents didn’t pay attention and said hello to the adventurer’s uncle who met last night. It seems very curious about where he plans to go.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
