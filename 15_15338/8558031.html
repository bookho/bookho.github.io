			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When seeing the huge black sailboat, Klein’s first reaction was fear and alertness, skeptical that the “king of the five seas” Nast was the demigod I am coming to myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he immediately denied this speculation, because in addition to using the "Black Emperor" card in the spiritual world, after he went out to sea, he almost did not let the one The cards were presented in the real world, only two or three times, and they also responded to the call and quickly entered the spiritual world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ability of fog to shield, with the anti-prediction and anti-predictive characteristics of the card, the "King of the Five Seas" Nast cannot and should not lock me ! Klein calmed down, got up and walked to the window, and Daniz looked at the "Black Emperor" against the common sense of sailing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge ship is slowly approaching in the shadow of the big piece, the scene on the deck is gradually clear, the sailors are either cleaning the deck, or bragging against the ship's side, and There were no knives or stun guns and there were no signs of looting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the cabin, there is a two- or three-meter-high mottled stone chair with a giant man sitting on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not seen the "King of the Five Seas" Nast look, Daniz could not help but lower his head, his body stiff, shivering, I want to be jealous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein also felt the indescribable majesty and shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no hard support, no stalking his head, and continues to look directly at the "King of the Five Seas" Nast, which has a high probability of attracting the attention of the other party, thus bringing unnecessary trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a person with many secrets, the bow still has to bow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein retracted his view and admired the carpet on the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, he saw the sun coming in again, and the shadow disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted his head and there was no such a huge black-skinned sailboat in sight, the wind was flat and the sky was high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did he suddenly come here? Didn't he say that he was still in the foggy sea some time ago?" Daniz frowned and wondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Black Emperor" can sail in the spiritual world, it is normal to come from the foggy sea in a few days... This may be Nast as "four One of the reasons for the beginning of the king... Klein sighed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that "King of the Five Seas" Nast is attracted by the "Black Emperor" card, but the other party's high probability can only determine a vague range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took his eyes back and sat down again, as if nothing had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The straight-line distance from Baiyam to Rijins is actually not long, but the safe enough channel is curved and round, and the passenger liner does not enter until dusk. port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Klein changed his appearance and used the fake ID to buy two tickets for the nearest time, and set off again before dark, in the morning light. Arrived at Graggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz did not enter the city, took Klein to a private port, and took a simple fishing boat to the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After nearly two hours, Klein saw a tens of meters long, clean and tidy sailing boat reflecting the golden color in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very special compared to its kind, with a main gun arranged along the central axis, the symbols and patterns on the barrel are stacked, and the flow is weak but pure . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a cannon of purification, can only be used ten times, and then requires six "light priests" to hold a ceremony, pray to the gods, and refill the spirituality. Daniz proudly introduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making a multitude of spells? After a certain period of time, there should also be a spontaneous spiritual loss... The power behind the "Iceberger" is the "eternal glory" church? Or can you cultivate the "priest of light"? Klein’s face was quiet, but he was guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not surprise the main gun when he first saw the "Golden Dream" in the Daniz dream. After all, the dream does not need to be in common sense. Perhaps Daniz had seen the Ironclad ship and left a very deep impression on the main gun, so it was reflected in the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Klein not think that the "Golden Dream" really has such a high level of occult knowledge, and the ordinary forces can't play at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the "Golden Dream" put down a small boat and quickly approached the fishing boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi's five fingers opened and clenched, jerked and steadily fell on the dinghy, causing little turmoil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He whistled, and the pirates who drove the boat patted the palm of their hand and found the feeling of the ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the excitement did not last long, and his back suddenly sank and more personal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Forget this madman... Daniz puts a smile and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the pirates, held down the hat, sat down calmly, and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn’t take long for him to board the deck of the “Golden Dreams” and saw the “Iceberger Lieutenant” Edwina quietly standing on the side of the side. Edwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pirate general was almost identical to the last time he met in a dream, and the hair makeup did not change, just replaced the skirt with a dark trousers. With leather boots, there is a lot more cool in the intellectual beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it’s more like a pirate than a teacher... Klein gently beheaded and politely laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, Captain Ms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Mr. German." Edwina smiled and responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her body and walked to a place where she was drying the net, indicating that other pirates were away and busy with their own affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fishing nets...not a pirate group more like a treasure hunter... is this prepared for a good meal? Klein silently followed, without a word, Daniz automatically consciously went to the most familiar couple to drink and brag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he did not relax his vigilance, and looked at it from time to time, fearing that the captain and German Sparrow would fight and be ready to say hello. The companion used to be surrounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Klein did not wait for Edwina to take the initiative to explain her intentions, silence for two seconds, and ask first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you know about Trey?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He plans to ask what he wants to ask first, and then Listen to Edwina’s intentions, lest I can’t agree, and after I choose to refuse, I’ll be embarrassed to ask again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trea?" Edwina’s eyelids micro-motion, "She is a witch, sequence 5 'painful witch'."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witches? Klein almost made a sound and felt that he and the witch were too fate, first the "witch" Terry, then the "happy witch" Mrs. Shelen, then the "happy" Terry Chik and the high-level witch who only heard the sound, now there is a "painful witch" Trey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina is not aware of his inner fluctuations and continues to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She and the general The witches are different, have their own ideas and pursuits, and are different in the witch sect, but she will still work for the organization, trafficking in the population or other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and What is the difference between witches? Do not give up self-awareness and choose to give women a happy time? Klein Horan thought of the red-haired Elaine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he dare not be sure, because the witches are not all male and female, and there are real women who want to be assassins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After asking a more specific situation, Klein made a sigh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We On the road I met Nast and his 'Black Emperor'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the last month, this sea area has appeared, Señol This is very unusual for things related to Trey and Nast. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four of the four kings and seven generals were involved in the short-term relationship with Rosde, which is not yet a member of the new Tarot Club." Above the star will be "Gardardia, from the perspective of probability, it is indeed very abnormal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
