			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Audrey’s heart, there has always been such a potential cognition, the colorful lizard = the pituitary gland of the colorful lizard = the size of the palm, the surface is soft and there are hills Feelings, extraordinary materials that constantly change color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what does this have to do with a three-meter-long, high-necked behemoth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, she was a little embarrassed, and when she heard Su Shi’s cry, she woke up, so she satisfactorily told the housekeeper:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the animal specimen I need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well...just a little bigger than I thought, So little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You lead the servants to move them to the warehouse, and I will study when I am free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Miss!" The butler immediately ordered the men's servants who were stealing their masters to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey looked around in a circle, no longer said a word, led Su Shi into the study room in the manor house, and excused to write a letter to his brother. Leave all the maids she brought outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anatomy is the pituitary of two colorful lizards... A spinal fluid for the replacement of Farsman rabbits, which can be blended into a bottle "Reading the Heart" potion... Audrey gradually got rid of the mistakes and sorrows, and began to think about how to promote Su Shi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, she thought of a serious problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, she doesn’t know if Su Shi has digested the potion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you haven’t completely digested it, then taking the “reader” potion can easily lead to loss of control... She is no better than human beings, can support the past, and so on, For the first time, she is strong in the past! Moreover, her current IQ is not worse than that of a child of about ten years old. She is learning the words of Lun language. She said that she wants to read newspapers and magazines and wants to read books... Audrey is silent for a few seconds. Next to it, I don’t know why the Golden Retriever dog looks at it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Su Shi, have you completely digested the potion?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Digestion?" Su Shi's words are in doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey has told her that she had taken the potion before, and told her not to tell others, and that she did not have a certain intelligence. animal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey is at a slower and slower position:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is a very wonderful The unique feeling, there seems to be something illusory in the body broken, and integrated with its own spirit, you can see one after another illusory stars, and you belong to one of them, these stars are attracted to each other, It seems that I want to be integrated into one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi quietly listened and replied briskly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I should have thoroughly digested it. I have had a similar feeling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啊? Su Shi completely digested the "audience" potion? However, no one taught her how to play the law! I reminded her at most occasionally, to observe more, to calm down the mind... Audrey asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did you digest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last month, last month, or earlier..." Su Shi tried to remember for a while, seeing the owner’s expression getting more and more weird, busy shaking his tail I added a sentence, "I can't remember... I am just a dog, I will not deliberately remember these things, Wang."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s just a dog...but the progress of your digestion is only a little slower than me... When I talk to other extraordinary people, I want to say that I am stronger than the dog in the matter of digesting the potion...呸, Ou What do you want? Audrey maintains an elegant smile and ceremonially praises: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, I mean, in digesting the potion, you Well done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning from Reppard, Klein slept leisurely for a nap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not long after, he was woken up by the confusing pray of the illusory cascading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Male? Mr. "Inverted man", is it still a small "sun"? Is the main material of my potion finally coming to one? Klein carefully identified for a few seconds, quickly forgot the disturbed anger, quickly got out of bed, went four steps backwards, and entered the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that the deep red star symbolizing "upside down" was shrinking and expanding, so he stretched his hand, spread spirituality, and touched the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the customary fool's name, "pour the person" prayed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... I have collected the medullary crystal of the devilish black panther's spinal fluid and the spring of the elf. Please allow me to hold a sacrifice ceremony. Please forward it to Mr. 'World'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The progress is very fast... "The hanging man" said that there will be a pirate meeting in the near future. It seems that it is not the most recent, that is now... He always has some hidden secrets, not true... Klein slammed invisibly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple sacrifice After the ceremony, Alger resisted the impulse of his heart and did not ask Mr. "The Fool" about "the star above the star". The star instrument around Jia Delia is related to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Klein has already left him behind, and is admiring two extraordinary materials placed on the surface of the bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spinal fluid of the evil-skinned panther is a tube that looks like a transparent liquid. If you look closely, you will find that its clarification is also hierarchical, the more down The more transparent, the one section, the perfect segmentation, fully satisfies the idea of ​​patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medullary crystal of the Elven Fountain is similar to the faded egg. The shell seems to be very thin. It may break when touched, and you can hear it without shaking. There is a slap in the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be possible to switch from the pharmacist to three hundred pounds of cash and recipe clues... my 'magician' is only the real rhizome of the foggy tree and Juice, I don't know when the small 'Sun' can complete the task..." Klein was thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for other auxiliary materials, he has already bought it in different stores. For example, water-shaped gemstones need to go to the jewelry store to buy them, and they grind them into powder. The weight of 5 grams is about 2 pounds and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik did not let Klein wait too long. On Wednesday evening, he whispered and told Mr. "The Fool" to prepare himself for the fog. The real roots and juice of the tree people, and ask the other person to hand over to the "world." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real rhizome of the foggy tree is heart-shaped, brown, palm-sized, front-removing, like the skin of the old man, the back is smooth and delicate, like a gem, it It is slightly expanding and contracting, and it seems that there is still some vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its juice is light green and crystal-clear, and it looks good at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at them like that, and was a bit smug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the contemporary, Sequence 7 is the threshold of the sequence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the extraordinary person finally bid farewell to a state that is only stronger in some respects than the average person, and will have a relatively rich and extraordinary ability! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein slowly sighed and returned to the bedroom to bring extraordinary materials into the real world in a way that he summoned himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not have to prepare the utensils, brushed the kitchen's iron cooker several times, and began to mix the potions in the order of the first auxiliary body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "clown" control of the body, he quickly completed the prelude, and successively put the spinal cord of the evil-skinned black panther and the real roots of the foggy tree man Go in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything calmed down, Klein was busy pouring out the liquid inside, and poured a drop into the clear glass bottle that was already prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liquid is quite special, just like the fireworks are always blooming inside, the colors such as red, orange, yellow and green are constantly dissipating, disappearing, and appearing constantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "magician" potion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein clips a pound of gold coins between the thumb and forefinger of the left hand, bounces up and spreads the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is using divination to confirm whether the potion he has deployed has been successful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold coins are falling, the portraits are facing up, and they are sure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein no longer hesitated, put away the gold coins, put on the potion, and walked out of the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sky is dark, the gas lamp in the room has not been illuminated, the surrounding area is dark, and only the place near the convex belly window is slightly bright. Out of the dim scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat down on the sofa and calmed down the inner sway with meditation, leaving all emotions short of themselves,<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, he took a tall glass bottle and raised his neck and drank the "Magic" potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold potion goes all the way down the throat, and there are countless bubbles bursting at all times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is realizing this kind of stimulation, and there is a huge flow of information in his mind, turning into a fireworks bloom one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forehead of his forehead is bulging and his head seems to be about to be split and burst! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is not too difficult for Klein to support, the horrible slang before the fog and the evil roar of the "real creator" than this It’s terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honakis...Fregra...Honakis...Fregra...Honakis...Fregra... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusion of ethereal illusion once again echoed, Klein's head swelled and contracted, contracted and expanded, gradually recovered his thoughts, began to constrain the idea consciously, outline the ball of light , little by little near the state of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long, his vision has recovered, and he feels itchy all over the body, with arms in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was busy pulling up his sleeves and saw that his arm was wrinkled, like a centenarian, the other lost color, became transparent, and Directly see the blood vessels, muscles and blue veins inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... Is it still a bit out of control? No, it shouldn't be, this is the remnant effect... Klein sits in the darkness, sits on the couch, leans forward, and looks at the anomaly of his arms with vigilance, just like there is a breeding monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the sound of pedestrians passing by on the streets outside, and heard Mrs. Starling greet her husband who had been late for more than half an hour, and heard Mr. Summer. I complained that there were too many carriages on the street and the road was too narrow, causing congestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this has nothing to do with Klein. He sits quietly on the sofa in the darkness, looking at the wrinkled skin and transparent state of the arm. Just a little bit of recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five or six minutes, everything is finally normal, Klein sighs silently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, no one came to knock on the door at this time... I completely digested the poison of the sequence 8 and chose to promote. There are such serious residual effects. Those who are time-honored and want to get through this level must be sure. It’s quite difficult.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s no wonder the captain spent nine years...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
