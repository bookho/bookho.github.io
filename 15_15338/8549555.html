			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daffodil Street No. 2, No. 4 and No. 6 are townhouse buildings with a polygonal four-sloping roof. The overall appearance is gray-blue and the three chimneys stand out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is of course no lawn and garden, no porch, and the entrance directly faces the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tingen City Improvement Housing Company" Skate held a string of copper keys and opened the door to introduce:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our townhouses do not have a foyer, they enter the living room, there is a convex window facing the daffodil street, the lighting is quite good..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Klein, Benson and Melissa is a set of cloth sofas bathed in golden sunlight and a spacious space comparable to their previous two-bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This living room can also be used as a living room, with a dining room on the right and a large fireplace on the left wall for your winter heating." Scat is familiar with Pointing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at it and confirmed that it was a rough open-plan, with no partitions in the dining room and living room, but far from the bulging window, it looked quite bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small red rectangular wooden table surrounded by six upholstered hardwood armchairs, and the fireplace and gram on the left wall Ryan has seen foreign movies and TV shows in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The back of the restaurant is the kitchen, but we don't provide any utensils, the living room is opposite the small room and bathroom..." Skater steps forward and will be on the first floor The rest of the layout is detailed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bathroom is divided into two inner and outer rooms, the outside is the place to wash, the inside is the toilet, separated by folding doors, the room is said to be small, but there are also Melissa The size of the living room is so large that she is a bit worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the first floor, Skater led the brothers and sisters to the stairway next to the bathroom:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The bottom is a underground storage room, the air inside is very dull, remember to ventilate before going in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson quietly Nod, follow Skater to the second floor along the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My left hand side is a washroom, and there are two bedrooms on the same side of it. I have the same pattern on the right hand side, but the bathroom is close to small. There is a balcony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, Skater opened the door of the bathroom and leaned over the body, so that Klein, Benson and Melissa could Obstruct the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bathroom has more bathtubs than the first floor. There are also folding doors next to the toilet. Although there is some dust, there are no other dirty places, no stench. Not crowded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa looked at it until Scare walked to the bedroom next to him, only to converge and follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps, she looked back again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein who has seen the world is also very happy and expecting this, because even if the landlord often supervises everyone’s cleaning, the public bathroom is still not clean enough, often people have The urge to vomit, not to mention the fact that it is easy to encounter queues when there is some urgency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other bathroom is the same as this one. The four bedrooms are only slightly larger, with bookshelves, the rest are almost the same size, have beds, have tables, and have wardrobes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The balcony is very small, and you can't get too much clothes at a time." Skate stood at the end of the corridor, pointing to the place where the door and the lock were separated. There are also complete sewers, gas pipes and billing devices. It is ideal for gentlemen and ladies like you. It only costs 13 sules per week and 5 pence of furniture. In addition, it takes a two-week deposit. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without waiting for Benson to speak, Klein was curious to look around:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Want to buy, how many pounds does this house need?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the traverser of the big country of eating, the desire to buy a home is always in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this problem, both Benson and Melissa were shocked, looking at the monster’s eyes and looking at Klein, and Skate replied firmly. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buy? No, we won't sell the property, only rent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to know, understand? Look." Klein尴尬Explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skart hesitated for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last month, 11 Daffodil Street The homeowner just sold a similar house, in the form of the land lease, 30 pounds in 15 years, which is much cheaper than direct rent, but not everyone can come up with such a large sum of money, if you want to buy it completely, the house The main price is 850 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;850 pounds? Klein quickly started his mental arithmetic: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My weekly salary is 3 pounds, Benson is 1 pound 10 Soule...Lease 13 Soule, eat well every day In the case, it will take about 2 pounds a week, as well as the apportionment of clothing, transportation expenses, interpersonal expenses, etc., etc., at most, you can drop more than a dozen Soules a year, about 35 pounds a year, £850 is about twenty years old... Even if it’s only 300 pounds in the land lease, it’s at least eight or nine years...it’s not considering future marriages, separations, children, travel, etc...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world without personal housing loans, most people should only choose to rent a house...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He realized that he had taken a step back and aimed at his brother, Banson, and signaled him to negotiate the rent price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Melissa’s wishes, she will understand the light that she has been shining! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, Klein has the illusion of "closing the door, putting the class". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson clicked on his cane without silver, and looked around:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We should go see other houses again. The lighting in the restaurant is too bad, the balcony is very small. You see, only the bedroom has a fireplace, and the furniture is too old. We have to change more than half of it..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly picked up a bunch of problems and quickly "convinced" Skate in ten minutes, letting him lower the price to rent 12 Soule, the level of furniture use fee is 3 pence, the deposit is also rounded to 2 pounds<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more wasting time, the brothers and sisters followed Scare back to "Tingen City Improve the housing company, signed a two-in-one contract, and went to the Notary Public Office in Tingen to find a notary public notary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the deposit and the first week's rent, Klein and Benson's remaining money add up to 9 pounds 2 Soller zero 8 pence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing at the door of No. 2, Narcissus Street, they held a string of copper keys, and they could not move their eyes and roll their emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It feels like a dream..." After a while, Melissa looked up and looked at the "Moretti House", the voice Said low and floated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson breathed a sigh of relief and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then don't wake up." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t feel so touched, nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to put the door and The lock on the balcony door was changed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not anxious, the reputation of the housing company in Tingen is very good. The rest is the cost of your dress, but Before that, we have to go to Mr. Francis.” Benson pointed to the direction of the apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going home to lick the rye bread, the brothers and sisters again Go to the townhouse on Iron Cross Street and ring the door of the landlord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should know my principles, absolutely not allowed to default on rent!" The short Mr. Francis sat on the sofa, very proud to declare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson leaned forward and smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Franche, we are To rent out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So straight? Is this negotiation really good? Klein was amazed at the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, Benson said that his bottom line is to compensate 12 Sule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Retirement? No! We have contracts, and half a year!" Frankie glared at Benson and waved his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson looked at him seriously and waited until he calmed down and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Franci Sir, you should be very clear, you should earn more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most more?" Francie touched his thin face, very Asked in anticipation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson sits upright, smiles and explains:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two-bedroom rent to us three people, It’s 5 Sule 6 pence, but if you rent it to a family of five people, six people, and two or even three people who are working and paying, I think they are willing to pay more for it. Instead of going to the street where the security is very bad, 5 Sule 10 pence, or 6 Sule, I think it is a reasonable price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Francie's eyes brightened and his throat squirmed. He continued: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, you know for sure, in recent years, housing rents have been on the rise, we The longer you live, the more you lose.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But... I need time to find a new tenant.” Mr. Franci, who inherits the estate and gets the apartment. Obviously hearted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that you will find it soon, you have this ability and resources, maybe two days, maybe three days... we will compensate you for this time. Loss, we use the deposit we paid, 3 Sule, this is very fair!" Banson immediately "boarding." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franci nodded with satisfaction:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Banson, you are a conscience, honesty Young people, okay, we signed the 'suspension contract'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked around and understood the easy "convincing" of Mr. Francis. ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too convincing...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolve the problem of the previous contract, the three brothers and sisters I went to help Klein to buy a formal dress and then started to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no heavy and huge items, they belong to the landlord, so Benson and Melissa jointly "rejected" Klein to hire a carriage. The idea, do it yourself, back and forth between Daffodil Street and Iron Cross Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the window, the sun slanted, and the golden color of the burning smell passed through the convex window and sprinkled on the desk surface. Klein looked at the shelf and placed it on the shelf. Neatly lit books and notes, gently place the ink and pen on a cleaned table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, he was busy... He vomited and felt the groan of his stomach, and put down the rolled cuffs and walked to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a bed that belongs to him only, sheets and quilts are white, old but clean,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Klein twisted the handle, walked out of the bedroom, waiting for the opening, and saw the opposite doors open, revealing the appearance of Benson and Melissa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the gray dust and dirty stains on each other's faces, Klein and Benson suddenly laughed and laughed very happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa bit his lip and gradually became infected with them, whispering a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stood in front of the mirror without a crack, carefully finishing the collar and cuffs of the shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes a white shirt, a black tuxedo, a half-high silk hat, a black vest and pants, leather boots, a bow tie, which cost him a total of 8 pounds, flowers He was very distressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the effect is also very good, Klein only feels that the volume of his own book in the mirror is more intense, it seems a little handsome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
