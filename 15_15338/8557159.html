Silent bursting, giving the stimulation of micro-hemp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hearing suddenly spread, and even the two maids at the end of the corridor regretted having no chance to talk to the Hall family castle and manor in East Chester. can hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Audrey felt that she dissolved into an illusory gas, and quickly expanded outwards, occupying the entire house, and each person’s spiritual consciousness The oceans overlap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her gaze also changed, everything she saw was exceptionally smooth, becoming an alternative mirror, showing her present appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pure beauty, exquisiteness, atmosphere, agility and other words describe the beauty, her bare skin is slowly growing a golden scale, green The scorpion contracted and was stained with pale gold, as if it had been erected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this kind of self, Audrey suddenly gave birth to fear from the heart, and did not want to be willing to become a non-human monster! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, her mind began to blur, and her body seemed to have something slowly painfully drilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, she heard the soft voice of Golden Retriever Su Shi:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t be afraid , calm down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be afraid, calm down. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey retrieved her thoughts and tried to get herself into the "audience" state.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her ups and downs of emotions quickly recovered, her spirit seemed to pull out of the body, and the audience looked down on herself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey saw the golden scales on the surface After apparent dissipating, I saw the emerald-like eyes become normal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, she regained her body and understood the extraordinary ability of the psychiatrist. And how to use it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just now, it’s really dangerous... Audrey is afraid to raise his hand, only to see the skin white and delicate, how can it be just the strange After this incident, she really understood the occasional mention of Mr. Fool, and the danger of losing control is always emphasized by Mr. Deeply aware of the difficulty of the extraordinary path.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there is a play, it is impossible to completely eliminate the hidden danger!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a meeting, Mr. "World" said that the extraordinary is always a pity against dangerous and crazy... I can only understand it literally, and now I finally feel it. The weight behind this sentence... Audrey, don't be discouraged, don't be afraid, dad, mom, brother, still waiting for your protection, with this experience, you won't be scared again in the future, not so It's easy to get out of control! Come on! Audrey clenched his fist and encouraged himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She calmed for two seconds, walked to Susie, half-squatted down, hug I lived in this golden-haired big dog, combing the other's hair, and using my head against the dog's side face, muttering in that warmth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Thank you, thank you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su's two times, seriously said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Audrey, is this the feeling of a psychiatrist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like it very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Audrey suddenly felt a little crying, immediately, she He sighed and promised:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Su Shi, we will treat each other later, um, psychological problems!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Wang!" Su Shi responded happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, Audrey really recovered and had a mood to examine the gains she had received:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "My body seems to be getting healthier. Although there is no obvious muscle, the strength and speed are much stronger than before...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My vision has improved, and even the items hidden in the dark can be clearly seen...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My sense of smell can distinguish more subtle odors So, to grasp the most realistic emotions and thoughts of the target...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I finally have extraordinary ability in the true sense, oh, one is 'shocking', Can be a single target, or a group within a range, let them face the dragon, instantly panic, confusion;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One is a frenzy ', the emotional or psychological state of the target, causing him to fall into the 'frenzy', suffering from the strong damage of the spirit, and sometimes even the target directly out of control;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "One is a 'psychological suggestion', through a specific action-specific language-specific medium, implying a goal, letting him follow my arrangement unconsciously, or strongly, from the heart, not wanting to violate a promise; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One is 'soothing', also called 'fine Analysis ', can make the extraordinary people on the edge of the out of control to find the rational, get rid of the dangerous situation, this has a certain probability of failure, the higher the sequence, the easier it is to succeed, can also calm the patients with various reasons for psychological instability, Being able to communicate;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One is the real 'reading heart', let the target be semi-hypnotic through the medium of candlelight, pure dew, etc., directly with his mind Physical communication, as Mr. Hilbert Arukard did to me, if there is no protection for the angel of Mr. Fool, I can't lie in that situation, oh... I have to be wary of it later. Skills, can not be deceived by the target, there should be many ways to achieve that effect...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With 'settled' and 'reading heart', then With a certain amount of psychological knowledge, I can play the real psychologist, and I can open the clinic! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey's mood is getting better quickly, and finally she has grown up and is a qualified person.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the extraordinary person in the sequence! Sure enough, she has a qualitative change! She stood up, lifted the skirt, and walked around in a brisk manner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She quickly discovered a problem, that is, the "psychologist" still lacks direct attack ability.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, I have it... Audrey stopped At the lab table, a very ordinary brown box was opened.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a silver mask in the box that could only cover the upper half of the face. It was the magical item that the "downside down" sold to her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey picked it up and placed it in the palm for a few seconds.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she spreads spirituality and gives her certain thoughts as she does above the fog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She saw the silver mask begin to curl up, Into the middle of a hollow, delicate pattern, slightly huge earrings <br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "necklace could become better. "Audrey whispers a word.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she is full of harvesting ability to try out all aspects of this magical item, and is most satisfied with the fine-tuning of the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, in addition to manipulating the flame, it has no more direct attack ability, maybe I have to prepare a pistol again, the kind of extraordinary effect... "Audrey was thinking about it with regret.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly converges her mind and speaks to the magical item on her hand, and the tail sounds up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From today, your name is 'lie,' the most beautiful lie~"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The City of Generosity" Bayam, Docklands, No. 48, Sour Lemon Street, "Azure Wind" Hotel.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside rain is like a note, the storm is sweeping, the fireplace is warm in the luxurious suite, and the environment is elegant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sits in a chair, silently Watching "Daniz himself handled a severe fracture of his left arm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the other party tied his arm with old clothes that were torn into strips, he bluntly said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
