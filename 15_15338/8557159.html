Silent bursting, giving the stimulation of micro-hemp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hearing suddenly spread, and even the two maids at the end of the corridor regretted having no chance to talk to the Hall family castle and manor in East Chester. can hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Audrey felt that she dissolved into an illusory gas, and quickly expanded outwards, occupying the entire house, and each person’s spiritual consciousness The oceans overlap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her gaze also changed, everything she saw was exceptionally smooth, becoming an alternative mirror, showing her present appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pure beauty, exquisiteness, atmosphere, agility and other words describe the beauty, her bare skin is slowly growing a golden scale, green The scorpion contracted and was stained with pale gold, as if it had been erected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this kind of self, Audrey suddenly gave birth to fear from the heart, and did not want to be willing to become a non-human monster! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, her mind began to blur, and her body seemed to have something slowly painfully drilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, she heard the soft voice of Golden Retriever Su Shi:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t be afraid , calm down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be afraid, calm down. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey retrieved her thoughts and tried to get herself into the "audience" state.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her ups and downs of emotions quickly recovered, her spirit seemed to pull out of the body, and the audience looked down on herself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey saw the golden scales on the surface After apparent dissipating, I saw the emerald-like eyes become normal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, she regained her body and understood the extraordinary ability of the psychiatrist. And how to use it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just now, it’s really dangerous... Audrey is afraid to raise his hand, only to see the skin white and delicate, how can it be just the strange After this incident, she really understood the occasional mention of Mr. Fool, and the danger of losing control is always emphasized by Mr. Deeply aware of the difficulty of the extraordinary path.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there is a play, it is impossible to completely eliminate the hidden danger!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a meeting, Mr. "World" said that the extraordinary is always a pity against dangerous and crazy... I can only understand it literally, and now I finally feel it. The weight behind this sentence... Audrey, don't be discouraged, don't be afraid, dad, mom, brother, still waiting for your protection, with this experience, you won't be scared again in the future, not so It's easy to get out of control! Come on! Audrey clenched his fist and encouraged himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She calmed for two seconds, walked to Susie, half-squatted down, hug I lived in this golden-haired big dog, combing the other's hair, and using my head against the dog's side face, muttering in that warmth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Thank you, thank you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su's two times, seriously said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Audrey, is this the feeling of a psychiatrist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like it very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Audrey suddenly felt a little crying, immediately, she He sighed and promised:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Su Shi, we will treat each other later, um, psychological problems!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Wang!" Su Shi responded happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My body seems to be getting healthier. Although there is no obvious muscle, the strength and speed are much stronger than before...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My vision There are also ascension, and even the items hidden in the dark can be clearly seen...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My sense of smell can distinguish more subtle odors, thus grasping Live the most realistic emotions and thoughts...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I finally have extraordinary power in the true sense, oh, one is 'shocking', can be a single target , can also be a group within a range, let them face the dragon, instantly panic, confusion; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One is 'frenzy', detonate the target The emotional or psychological state that puts him in a 'frenzy', suffers from a strong level of mental damage, and sometimes even causes the target to go out of control;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" One is a 'psychological cues' that implies a goal through a specific language-specific medium specific to the action, leaving him unknowingly According to my arrangement, or strongly, from the heart, do not want to violate a promise; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One is 'settled', also called 'psychoanalysis', can Let the extraordinary people on the edge of out of control find their senses and get rid of dangerous situations. This has a certain probability of failure. The higher the sequence, the easier it is to succeed. It can also calm down patients who are psychologically unstable due to various reasons and be able to communicate; Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One is the real 'reading heart', through the medium of candlelight, pure dew, etc., let the target be semi-hypnotic, communicate directly with his mind, Like what Mr. Hilbert Arukard did to me, if there is no protection for the angel of Mr. Fool, I can't lie in that situation, oh... I have to be wary of similar skills, not Being deceived by the target, there should be many ways to achieve that effect...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With 'settled' and 'reading heart', plus certain Psychology knowledge, I can play the real psychologist, can ! Clinic that "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Audrey's mood improved rapidly, finally have their own has grown up and is qualified as extraordinary feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the extraordinary in the sequence! Sure enough, there is a qualitative change! She stood up, lifted the skirt, and walked around in a brisk walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly discovered a problem, that is, "psychologists" still lack direct attack ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, I have it... Audrey stopped at the lab table and opened a very ordinary brown box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a silver mask in the box that can only cover the upper half of the face, which is the magic that the "downside man" sold to her. article. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey picked it up and placed it in the palm of his hand for a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, she spreads spirituality and gives her certain thoughts as she does above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw the silver mask begin to roll in, turning into a hollow, delicate pattern, slightly large earrings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It might be better to become a necklace." Audrey whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, she is full of harvesting ability to try out all aspects of this magical item, and is most satisfied with the fine-tuning of the appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, in addition to manipulating the flame, it has no more direct attack ability, maybe I have to prepare a pistol again, the kind of extraordinary effect... Audrey thought with regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly converges her mind and speaks to the magical item on her hand, saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Starting today, your name is 'lie,' the most beautiful lie~"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The City of Generosity" Byam, Docklands, No. 48, Sour Lemon Street, "Azure Wind" Hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat in a chair and silently watched the "flame" Daniz himself dealing with a severe fracture of his left arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the other party tied his arm with old clothes that were torn into strips, he bluntly opened his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What treasure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Daniz’s statement, it is because of a certain treasure, "the blood will be" Senigal I want to deal with "Iceberg Lieutenant" Edwina Edwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the wind and rain sounds through the window, Daniz drank the "strong lyrics" on the table, and laughed angrily and bitterly: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guy who had his brain smashed!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We were on the last adventure In it, I found a shipwreck. Although I didn’t harvest anything that was too valuable, I found a huge black iron key that was not used by humans. Can you imagine? After sinking on the bottom of the sea for so many years, it did not rust. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can. Klein responded in a concise manner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is impossible in a world of extraordinary and mysterious intertwined?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Death and resurrection, let alone other!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz was stunned and slowed down for seven or eight seconds before knowing how to say: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We may have traitors inside, and this news has been proclaimed. Countless pirates believe that this is the key to death, the key to unlock the treasure of the dead. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I originally thought that this issue would be clarified soon, happily applying for a vacation, and as a result, things became more complicated, even the 'blood will be' Joining the ranks of those crazy pirates, I have some doubts that maybe it is the 'key of death', a key that can make people become true gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid Klein calmly gave the evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether in the field of divination or dealing with the gods, he is very experienced, so he has his own interpretation of the "key of death". And very confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that the "key" is a revelation, a symbol, the great probability of opening the treasure house of death is not a key shape, but a certain characteristic, some kind Blood, even a certain number of people and their descendants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz sighed for two seconds and sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before your words and the captain The evaluation is exactly the same, even the expressions are very similar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She suspects that the key belongs to an older age, not a human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before the Cataclysm, the world is still active with giants, dragons, elves, devils and other creatures, and the key shape is vaguely directed to them. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devil Wolf... Klein suddenly thought of the proverb that always echoed in his ear when he was promoted. The "Fregra" in it means The ancient god "destroyed the devil". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A treasure involving the Second Age? He pressed his curiosity and said calmly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Write all the things that have been done on the 'blood', including 'Steel' Maviati and His men."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers that "the blood will be" and his pirate group is the most notorious group on the ocean, can be said to be full of blood, evil Deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can I remember? They are not the beauty of the captain!" said Daniz, "I can only list the most important deeds, and me." Some of the details that are impressive, hey, what do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled bit by bit, letting Daniz smile with trepidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
