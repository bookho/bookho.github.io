			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 pm, Swordfish Bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who had not yet received a bounty in the afternoon, went out and went to Us. Kent’s eyes and got the flow, but tomorrow The answer to the money in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He accidentally pretended to participate in the private transactions of the adventurers in the swordfish bar, but unfortunately failed to find the main material or magical items of the "Master Master" potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change back to the original, Klein pressed the top hat, trying to squeeze through the crowd, leaving the bar that is in the most lively and final stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, a gaze swept his face, most of them were first stunned, and immediately stopped for two seconds, as if to identify something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, they retracted their sights and retreated toward the place away from Klein, like the tide that was separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German Sparo's look and strength, they have learned from newspapers and rumors, more details are gradually becoming adventurers, The various places where pirates and gang members gathered gathered, so that many people had a preliminary understanding of the situation at the time, knowing that Gilman Sparrow discovered the "smartwriter" Misor Kim and immediately shot and fired. Crazy move, so everyone is consciously away from this dangerous guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trader Ralph was drinking in front of the bar, suddenly noticed that there was an abnormality there, instinctively turned his body and looked at the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He soon saw a faceless, gentle and angular gentleman, and his mind naturally appeared in the corresponding portraits published in The News:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German Sparo who hunted the "smartwriter"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed by, Ralph thought of the chattering time with the rebel leader Karat in the evening, confirming that this crazy adventurer does not exclude "Poseidon" ", even witnessed the private deal of the Rebels and "Iceberg Lieutenant." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may be able to develop him into a "Poseidon" believer... Even if he is not interested in the future of the islands, he may help in certain things... ... Ralph clasped his hands and placed them on his lips, making a movement that seemed to be blowing a conch. This is one of the gestures of praying to "Poseidon" Cavitehua. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he jerked up and took the beer mug to go to German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein also noticed the closeness of Ralph and recognized who the other party was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the devotee who once wanted to dedicate one-third of the 20,000 gold pounds to "Poseidon"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the former pirate businessman who was sent to be a children’s charity fund! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the news related to the charity fund and the other party is always piously praying, his understanding of Ralph can be said to cover all aspects, so he is very confused Why would you try to contact German Sparrow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there a commission? Resist the military because of various reasons can not do things? Klein looked at Relf and slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Gilman Spallo?" Ralph raised the beer mug in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded and naturally maintained a man-made path:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, the knowledge between adventurers is always very simple, maybe only need a glass of wine." Ralf pointed to the bar, "have Not interested in a cup?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Klein has deep doubts and a simple response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit in the corner of the bar, he asked for a cup of Nanwell beer, and watched Ralph while drinking, not taking the initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a good experience to be quietly watched by a pirate general. Ralph took a sip of beer and concealed the spirit of tension. Haha Laughter:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein flashed a line in his mind and finally settled on a few words that were relatively erected:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Relph almost slammed, coughing two channels:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have the honor to introduce you to us God, the Savior of the Islands, the leader of the sea, Cavitowa?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, the sea is so vast, the storm is so terrible With its own, even the four kings of the big man can not guarantee that they will overcome all kinds of difficulties and survive. At this time, we need a god, a god who can respond to you and take charge of the sea and storm power. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show me to myself, then let me believe in myself... Klein controls the fretting of the corner of his mouth and says:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am more interested in whether you have magical items, which are very powerful and aggressive. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relph reveals a sincere smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We didn't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But as long as you devoutly believe in 'Poseidon', you may get a corresponding gift one day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;I don't... Don't make a promise for me! Klein was so angry and funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt that the conversation could not continue, so he ate a large cup of Southwell Beer Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I will think about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was about to leave, the bartender suddenly came over and squinted and smiled:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Gilman Sparo, there is a commission here to find you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Klein glanced at Relf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter happily carried the beer and left the seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very satisfied with the results of today, because he never thought of developing a crazy adventurer into a "Poseidon" believer. His purpose is to let each other Know that there is such a possibility, and actively consider the pros and cons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the corner of the bar is quiet, the bartender laughs and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He claims to be the one you know The pharmacist, there is a task that you want to entrust to you. If you are interested, you can wait here and we will contact him as agreed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cognitive pharmacists ? Chubby Duckwell? Dakwell who has a chubby owl? What commission will he have? Rescuing his teacher Roy Kim? I can't do this kind of thing, the risk is too high... The thoughts turn around, and Klein decides to listen to what the other party has to trust:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near 11 o'clock, Klein at the Swordfish Bar 3 In the billiard room, I saw the fatter and pharmacist Dirkwell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party has replaced the relatively prominent rural witch doctor’s robe and started to dress up as a local man – Taraba, wide-leg pants and brown jacket And the round-faced owl is quietly resting on Dakwell's right shoulder, staring at the adversary opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Miss Justice is very similar to the other members of the Tarot Club... This owl may be an extraordinary creature, the type of "audience"? Klein’s heart was judged, but the surface was quiet, and he asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What commission do you have?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case." The fat pharmacist rubbed his left hand in his pocket and held the ring box tightly. "I am going to have a trip and go to another island. Oh, it takes about three days. Because of certain things. I may be in danger, of course, or not. In short, I need a bodyguard, and you are the best person I can think of."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How dangerous is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell’s lips licked a few times:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't be sure, if, if the danger exceeds your ability, you can hand me over to the other party. This is the promise we have agreed on now, and will not destroy your reputation."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I didn’t know that you were not good enough to talk to me, I thought you were using the “aggressive method”... Kline thought: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of compensation can you pay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dakwell wanted to say the answer well long ago, but for a moment There is some hesitation, because things are really dangerous. If the chips are not enough, it is difficult to impress Gelman Spalo. He is afraid of "Members". Before the desperation, the bodyguards will give up resistance. This is why he must ask the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at him and said coldly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can think about it first.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went to the bathroom, come back and tell me the answer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he turned his body, walked to the door, twisted his handle, and stepped out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; His response seems to be sophisticated, there is a kind of cool and cold-hearted adventurers and bounty hunters, but in fact, he does not really want to think about the time for fat pharmacists, purely looking for opportunities to go to the bathroom, to the gray Divination above the fog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the key to his mission!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out In the billiard room, at the door of the bathroom, Klein lined up the team and finally waited for a toilet to vacate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into it, he frowned and was The dirty and smelly smell of the environment made a nausea, almost turned away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly closed the door, poked the flush button, he While sighing the divination environment, the four-step reversal of the four-step process, the ceremony was launched.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chess interior, Dakwell, etc. to the back of the German Sparrow Completely disappeared Close the door agilely and ask the owl on the shoulder:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will he betray me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. The owl yelled. "And, be polite when asking me questions, please call Mr. Harry." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawell's face fluffed a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Harry, you think What kind of compensation will he accept? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very difficult to see through him, he is good at concealing his expression. The owl responded calmly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn Mr. Harry, no, damn stupid bird! Dakwell cursed in a secret, pacing back and forth, thinking about chips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Klein returned to the billiard room No. 3 and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already divined over the fog, the mission is acceptable, and he just wants to leave Baiyam in the short term.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"800 pounds for 3 days, and our friendship, I mean the friendship between my teacher and his friends. Dakwell said with less confidence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was silent for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "1000 pounds for 3 days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, your organization helped me get a powerful offensive magic item, I will pay cash at a reasonable price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
