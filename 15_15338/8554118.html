			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picking manuscripts, no, creative manuscripts, should be considered valuable books... Is this a "small card"? Klein's heart moved, licking his teeth and quietly turning on the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he did not find any anomalies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swept through other bookmarks and still got the same answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, if it’s so easy to detect, it’s not my turn to come here... Klein turns off the vision and re-uses from Russell’s diary Know the details and the character that the emperor presented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his knowledge, since Russell said that the book with the "Big Card" is valuable, it will not be too ordinary, otherwise it will not Satisfy the strong evil tastes - use a lot of high-value knowledge to set off the inconspicuous bookmarks, and let the winners invisibly be teased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, valuable but not high books can be ignored, so that... Klein looks around and carefully discerns, completely ignoring the commentator what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Comprehensive judgment, in the whole 'study', it seems that only the creative manuscript is eligible, other values ​​can only be said to be general, to Rose Er's character, certainly will not pick them, ah, Russell is the kind of 'I will hide the secret in the most conspicuous place, but you can't find anyone's..." Klein thought to the emperor Equipped with a "slightly slightly" expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he can’t be sure that the bookmark is a "smack card" disguise, because Russell’s books with high value obviously include The work of the field of occult, and this part of the book, the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery is definitely impossible to show out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you must first confirm whether it is a 'street card' and then consider whether you want to act. Unfortunately, this date cannot be used on January 20th. Excluded, no one knows which day each bookmark was clipped into the book... Klein silently whispered a word and turned to the stopped commentator, smiling: <br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do the people on the bookshelf have something like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, a noble lady wrote to Rose Er's note."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question has caused many men to make a heartfelt laugh, and the female commentator shook his head:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, books with extra things are picked out and placed here for everyone to watch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This is just a restoration of Russell's study, not a point in time to restore the study, and does not need to maintain a certain state without change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;g Well suddenly he smiled and said: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "see, this is really disappointing ah ......" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; &nbsp;This is simply great! There was only one bookmark to be verified in the entire exhibition hall, and the difficulty plummeted... He rejoiced in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the introducer introduced "Russell's favorite book to read", Klein once again looked around and observed the overall layout of the exhibition hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to restore the room more than a hundred years ago, there was no gas lamp around the exhibition hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lighting relies mainly on the convex window with an iron fence a few meters away and the huge crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the brass lamp holder on the desk, the candle is not placed, it is just a display. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the window and saw the yellow and fading lawn and a straight iron black pole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered the position and re-visited the book introduced by the female interpreter. In his mind, he began to analyze the feasibility of stealing the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One premise is that, according to Russell, the major churches and the ancient families who are royals are reluctant to see him spread. The card 'destroyed a stable order for more than a thousand years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the items left by Russell are still there, it means that he must in some way let everyone, including the gods, believe that he sent all the 'brands of cards' out, leaving no one left. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, it is not excluded that some churches or an ancient family try to rely on the 'Big Card' to complete an extraordinary path that they need, but This may be very small, because this gives Roselle the opportunity to squash the horizontal united front, there is no need to go to the stage of spreading the '亵渎之牌' to destroy the order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In that case, his diary will show some confidence and corresponding concerns. It is absolutely impossible to leave only pessimism, just to rely on the ancient secret organization."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the addition of more than a hundred years, the Church of Steam and Machinery, which keeps these legacy items, has no idea how many additional searches have been made, so almost no one believes. '亵渎之牌' is hidden here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the security level of this exhibition will not be too high."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, it is very important that the entire Beckland is killed by the serial The 'devil' is so frustrating that the extraordinary people of the three churches are doing city-wide investigations and searches, and the number of people who can be assigned to this unimportant exhibition by the 'Mechanical Heart' team is definitely very limited."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the most worthwhile protection here is Russell’s diary. Many wild extraordinary people admire the great emperor and think that those 'original symbols' are written with deep mystery. The motivation and ability to steal, so the caretaker's center of gravity must be in that exhibition hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back to the fog and divination, and my analysis Confirmation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, it is necessary to pre-verify whether it is a 'street card', or it takes a certain amount of danger and it takes a lot of effort, but the result is Stealing back a normal bookmark, then I might as well lie back in the graveyard! Well, what should I do? What about the certificate? It can't be done when I sneak in again, but now I have no chance... I have to find someone else to help... Be cautious!” Kline looked intently behind the instructor and seemed to listen very seriously. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician", she is an "apprentice" who is able to cross the wall and is similar to holding a "master key". It is a good candidate... But she only sequence 9, sneaking into the verification of this task is too dangerous for her...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Hugh? No, she is not this piece of material... Let her find a thief to help? No, no, there are extraordinary guards here, and the thief is caught on the spot with great probability, thus revealing something that someone is playing Russell's bookmark idea...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sha Miss Lun? She is strong enough and her status is suitable for this kind of task. The problem is that the "Big Card" is a god that is enough to kill most of the extraordinary people. I still believe her...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's thoughts turn and analyze the helpers he can find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, he locked an object:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her family is extraordinary, belongs to the nobility, is it possible to use money and power, using interest as an excuse to touch the bookmark? Well, the opportunity is not small, and this method will not be alarmed to anyone, which will help me to sneak into stealing... Klein thinks that the more feasible it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the question of how to verify, because "the card of the card" anti-prediction and anti-prophecy, he can only think of one way at a time:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is trying to destroy the bookmark! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Anti-Divination Anti-Prophecy is not to say that a similar means is used for an item that contains the "Big Card", which will result in failure or interference. In that case, isn’t it equal to not making a move? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real meaning is that even if you get the "Big Card", divination is equal to divination for an ordinary thing, which is equivalent to disguising it. That ordinary thing divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I can’t guess what the Great Emperor set up to “enable passwords” and can only be confirmed with such a simple and rude method, if the “Big Card” can indeed be Destruction, it can only be said that I have no fate with it for a while... Well, with the Emperor’s preference, maybe I can try to open a curse...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
