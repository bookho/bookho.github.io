			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vo! vomit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was there, it was difficult to contain the vomiting, because no breakfast, and quickly spit out the inventory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a tin-iron square pot, much like a cigarette box, appeared in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth of the lost cork exudes a mixture of flavors like tobacco, disinfectant, mint leaves, etc., so that Klein's nose is stunned, the whole person The spirit is up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong stench still lingers around, but Klein doesn't feel nausea anymore, and vomiting stops quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went up the tin-iron square pot and saw a pale hand that was not like a living person. He saw the sleeve of the black trench coat and saw it. The temperament is cold and dark, "the corpse" Frye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Klein slowly slowed down and held his knees and stood up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frye nodded with no expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Habit is fine."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stuffed the bottle of Tin Tin pot into his pocket and turned to the body of the highly rotten old woman without gloves. The inspection started directly, and Dunn Smith and Leonard Mitchell were walking around the room, touching the table and newspapers from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil pinches his nose and stands outside the door, complaining snoring:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's so disgusting, I have to apply for a subsidy this month!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun turned back and touched the wall next to the fireplace with his right hand with black gloves Gray, looking to Klein Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Familiar here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein Screen Staying in the air, sketching your own silver-white pocket watch in your mind, calms your mind and body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in a state of vision and he immediately had a different feeling, and Huoran flashed a picture from the deepest memory:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fireplaces, rocking chairs, tables, newspapers, rusty nails on the door, silver tin cans...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This picture is dull and dark, like a documentary on the earth, but more blurred and more illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It quickly overlaps with what Klein sees in front of him. The feeling of deja vu, seems to have come, is obvious, and the illusion and erratic cry once again penetrates the invisible The barriers come:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honakis...Fregra...Honakis...Fregra...Honakis... Fregra..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little bit familiar." Klein replied truthfully, his head was a bit stinging, so he had to tap twice in his eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honakis...the Hornacs Mountains that appeared in the original main diary? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was read from the Antignus family notes...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whisper is very similar to that of the previous one. It involves the term Hornachs... Is this tempting? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was shocked and did not dare to think deeply, fearing that he was on the wrong track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn nodded slightly, went to the front of the cabinet, and suddenly reached out and opened the wooden door above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the bread grows mold, and there are seven or eight gray, hard-haired mice next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leonard, you go downstairs to find the patrolling police, figure out the situation here." Dunn told the players. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Leonard turned and left the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den immediately opened the two-bedroom door and searched it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he confirmed that no clues were found, and the notes of the Antignus family, the "collector" Frye straightened his waist and rubbed his hands with a white handkerchief:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Death for more than 5 days, no trauma, no significant impact caused by extraordinary strength, the specific reasons must wait for further inspection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Did you find anything?” Dunn turned to look at the old Neil and Kline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two who left the state of vision as early as they shook their heads at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Besides having a dead person, everything is normal here, no, there is an invisible force that has sealed the room at first, you know, when we use ritual magic, there are often Similar operation." Old Neil thought for a few seconds, added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun was about to speak, and suddenly looked out the door. After a few seconds, Klein and the old Neil noticed something and turned to look at the corner of the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, the subtle footsteps gradually grew, and Leonard and a policeman came up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police officer smelled stench and his face changed slightly. Immediately, he cooperated with the "colleagues" of the Special Operations Department to knock on the door of the second-floor occupants. The situation of the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, wearing a silver two-V epaulette, he looked at the dead body on the rocking chair:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Kate Stephana Bieber, between the ages of 55 and 60, the widow, and her son Riel Bieber have been renting here for more than a decade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;" Her husband was a jeweler before her life. Her son was about 30 years old. He had no wife and inherited his father's career. He had a weekly salary of 15 pounds and 15 sules. According to their neighbors, it has been more than a week. I met them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description is here, Klein knows where the next focus is:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Missing, more accurately said that I don’t know where I went, Riel Bieber! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old note is probably on his body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there a photo of Riel Bieber?" Dunn looked at the police officer, who played a senior inspector. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this can’t be faked, because in the police department’s file, he is indeed a senior inspector. Salaries and subsidies are based on this. Of course, not included. That part of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police officer shook his head nervously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know...you must go back to the branch office Well, normally, we can't leave a photo for every guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, you continue to ask the residents on the first floor, ask in detail Dunn made the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the police officer, he closed the door and turned to the old Neil Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Then I will hand it over to you, otherwise I will let the residents here sleep, and look for Riel Bieber from their dreams. Well, I don't trust the drawing done according to the dictation."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil nodded, taking a few thumb-sized bottles from the pocket of the black classical robes and spilling the liquid in a certain order. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he took out a powder and sprinkled around himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange, pungent smell of transpiration is not affected by the stench in the room, but Klein suddenly feels that the old Neil has a circle The invisible power, the power that separates him from the environment and himself, is like the state before the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil closed his eyes halfway, his mouth twitching, and he read a low and vague mantra. Klein was not ready, only vaguely heard "I Pray for the power of the goddess," "I look forward to the care of the night"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! Suddenly the wind blown through the window and blew the powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s heart suddenly trembled, the cockroaches on the skin all bulged out, only some kind of hard-to-describe, extremely dareless, extreme horror The "taste" quickly permeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His head is confused and tight and unable to relax, just like the state after a difficult math problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Neil’s eyes opened and his eyes were dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a water-absorbing pen from his pocket and brushed it on the waste paper on the table. The movement was so fast that the whole body was shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stared at him, only to see a deep eye socket, the face of the high nose quickly appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the short hair of the natural roll is completed, Daniel writes a line of words under the portrait:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Black hair, dark blue eyes, and all-ceramic dentures on the left side of the mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! The pen in the hands of Old Neil fell on the paper, and his body twitched a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what Riel Bieber looks like in the room." Old Neil whispered his eyelids quickly returning to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he returned to the previous position, slowly turning around in the same place, the invisible, intermittent force suddenly dissipated, turning into a breeze open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like the beauty of the gods." Old Neil joined the chest four times, and made up the shape of the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s spirit relaxed and observed more carefully. It was found that Ryle Bieber’s features were nothing special, and the temperament was quite peaceful, just on the sides of the nose. The decree lines are obviously drooping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I try to find a way to find things with a stick." He picked up the portrait and flipped through the male clothes in the bedroom and put them all. Spread on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun, Leonard and Old Neil did not stop, watching him put silver-plated black cane on clothing and portraits, "The corpse Frye is as silent as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown turned black, and Klein finished his meditation deep and quietly, releasing his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cane stands quietly, just like inserting the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Riel Bieber's position." Klein meditated again in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wind of the wind, the cane fell down, and in the process of falling, it changed direction, and eventually turned into a small rotation around the fulcrum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of any external strength, this silver-plated black cane has stood firm again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein tried several times and was the same ending, only shaking his head against Dunn and Old Neil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different forces interfere with their own "divination"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den will black gloves Take off, for Leonard and Klein: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You take the portrait of Riel Bieber to ask the residents here and make a final confirmation. Then he wanted him in the name of murdering the mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein took the cane and bent over to pick up the portrait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the neighbors confirmed that the person on the portrait was indeed Riel Bieber, Dunn asked Leonard and the police officers to go to the police station to complete the formalities. Lai went to several bars in Tingen City to find people through underground channels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and Old Neil returned to the Black Thorns Security Company in a public carriage, less than eight o'clock, and Rosanne had not arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the door, Klein looked at the old Neil sideways, and half of the doubts were asked to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why me, will I send the notes of the Antignus family to Riel Bieber's house?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This and Vail The odd residence to the Iron Cross Street is not a direction at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil walked to the sofa, hehe smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this not very obvious? You don't know whether it touches the power in the notes, or curious to do some of the rituals it describes, and it provokes a strange existence that should not be provoked, and this power, the purpose of this existence is to give notes to Riel Bieber. And break all the clues and let no one discover."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
