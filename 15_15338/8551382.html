			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No... Is Mr. Azick the so-called first-generation Baron Ramde? This is the character of 14,000 years ago... No, how sure the person on the portrait is the first Baron Ramd... Klein stared at the painting, and there was a chaos in his mind, like suddenly discovering all the people around him. Become a monster, or the whole world is just a dream of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jerked his head up, staring at the yellow-haired middle-aged man in front of him, reaching out and taking the revolver from his arm, and said:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not an antique. If you don't make it clear, I will arrest you for fraud and sue you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Regardless of whether the prosecution belongs to the police department, there is only one purpose, that is, to intimidate the other party and obtain information! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Klein scorned the left side of the teeth twice, turning on the vision, monitoring the emotional color changes of the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huangfa middle-aged was shocked and replied in horror:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I also I don't know if it is antique, no, I heard that it is antique, but I don't understand it, I really don't understand, I don't even know how many words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He turned his eyes and looked around, as if he wanted to call for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, he saw Klein adjust the wheel and the trigger and put on a look to kill the suspect in the rebellion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brushed his back straight and never dared to look around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you get this painting?" Klein asked in a deep heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huangfa middle-aged lips swayed, pleased with laughter:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police, this is my grandfather from Found in the old fort, more than 40 years ago, the outer wall and the second floor room collapsed, there are some items, things that the previous people could not find, including this painting, no, no, not this one Oil painting, the original oil painting has been very ruined, and there is no way to save it. My grandfather asked someone to imitate a painting. Well, that is the one you just saw. I didn’t lie to you, more than 40 years ago. The paintings can really count as antiques..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you are sure this is the portrait of the first Baron Ramde?" Kline Mohan took the trigger and let the other person's sight I dare not move at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huangfa middle-aged laughter said: "I am not sure, but I guess it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reason?" Klein was almost laughed at by the other person's shamelessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because there is no name on the oil painting." Huang Fa replied in a serious middle age. "Like I was called a rogue, my father was called a curly hair." Gerry, and only my grandfather is the real Gerry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein breathlessly said:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your grandfather?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the cemetery, he has been buried there for almost twenty years, and his side is My father, buried three years ago." Huang Fa answered very honestly in middle age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein asked for a while from another angle, adjusted the pistol wheel in the middle of the yellow hair, and put it back into the gun pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick up the police officer’s ID, and in a black thin windbreaker, he turned his body and walked into the hotel with his hands in the faint light in the houses on both sides. Silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unsure whether the portrait belongs to the first Baron Ramd... I don't know if the town has the exact history of the castle..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But in any case, the gentleman on the portrait must have been an ancient person, at least an ancient man a thousand years ago..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "He and Mr. Azke are almost identical except for their hairstyles. Is this the so-called reincarnation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, there is another possibility. For example, the one on the portrait is Mr. Azick, and Mr. Azke is him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of it, gram Ryan was shocked and almost stumbled by the steps ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a few steps back and forth under the destroyed gas streetlights, combined with the insights of the information big bang era, and made further analysis based on the previous guess: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Azick became an undead for some reason, such as a vampire, so lived from ancient times to the present?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, there are vampires with bronze skin..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And when I shake hands with Mr. Azick, I can clearly Feeling his body temperature, he felt blood in his body flowing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He hates the heat of the South, but he is not afraid of the sun, once against the sun , and other teachers teamed up in the boat..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, there is such a possibility, Mr. Azick’s sequence potion or other factors Bringing him a long life, and the price is losing his memory! Hey, considering his completely different dream, can he assume his mind? Lost is a cycle? Every few decades, he will forget the past and get a new life, and that dream is the real life he once experienced... Oh, I seem to have seen similar novels..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To verify this, you can't do it by divination. You must find the traces of Mr. Azick's life. No childhood, directly from Traces of the beginning of adulthood!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boldly assume that Klein, who is careful to prove it, tends to favor his own guess, but the "reincarnation" may not be ruled out for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He converges on the mess, seriously considering whether to inform the team leader Dunn:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If Mr. Azick is an ancient extraordinary who has lived for more than a thousand years, his strength will be stronger than I thought..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "He reminded me that it was goodwill, but after I found his past clues, it would be hard to say whether he would keep goodwill..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Zucker has always been very good to me, and it is not difficult for him to introduce the value of the night to harm him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call, go to the fog to eliminate interference Divination once, this is the most important choice for the diviners!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein made a decision and accelerated back to the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;趁The opportunity for Dunn and Frye to return, he spent 1 Sule and reopened a room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entering the room, Klein used the "Silver Powder" to create a spiritual wall, then went four steps backwards, penetrated the crazy slang, and came to the fog. on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magnificent palace stands quietly, with no changes in the old and mottled bronze long tables and twenty-two high-back chairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat at the top, letting a yellow-brown parchment and a black round belly pen appear in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the pen and wrote it carefully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should be Mr. Azke’s business Tell Dunn Smith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he untied the citrine pendant in the left cuff and made a divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to this divination is to turn counterclockwise, "should not tell"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the citrine pendant, Klein has always thought for a few seconds, decided to change the "dream divination" to try, to be safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, his divination statement became "the consequence of concealing Mr. Azick's related matters inside the night." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
