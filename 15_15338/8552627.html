			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try? "Justice" Audrey is excited, reserved and elegant: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am happy to cooperate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an "audience", she clearly remembers that "Foolish" used only "try" on two things, one is to pull himself and "downside down" into this mysterious space. At the time, the second is to give the name, let the two of them try to pray, and the results are enough to succeed, and reveal some of his essence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the attempt this time? Really looking forward to it! Audrey took care of her unsuccessful mood and tried to be a qualified "audience." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try... "Put the Man" Alger’s spirit is tense and full of alert to the "fool" proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does He want to do? What is his true purpose? Is this good or bad for me? One by one, the thoughts poured out and fell, and Alger’s mind showed the appearance of “Hurricane Lieutenant” when Kiringes died quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he lowered his head and replied graciously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your wishes are mine Expectation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "sun" next to Dairik looked at the "downside down" and looked at "justice", not understanding why they were so The "try" is as sensitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein tapped the finger on the edge of the bronze long table and smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This attempt will make your transaction simple and secure, and confidential enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s slightly headed, looking at the “downside down”, not fast Speaking slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you remember the sacrificial rites described by the Sun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Klein deliberately mentioned this thing, that is, to show his own frankness, so that the members of the Tarot Club could hardly think that the sacrifice ceremony he was about to provide was derived from the description of the "sun". It is hard to think that he had tried his best. To lie to a template for a sacrifice ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember, I have also been exposed to this aspect." Alger replied honestly, but his heart burst into hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the orthodox gods have rarely responded to similar rituals, since the Fifth Age, the word "sacrificial" has often been equated with the evil devil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that there may be some terrible results, "slowing down people" feels that they are walking on the edge of the abyss and will fall down accidentally. Corroded and swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not explain too much according to the scheduled plan, nodded slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" My idea is that you will sacrifice the extraordinary materials to me through the ceremony, and I will give Miss 'Justice'. This form of transaction is beneficial to both of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Can it still be like this? Audrey was a bit dumbfounded and felt that it was beyond the limits of her imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But soon she woke up and wanted to understand the advantages of this approach and the hidden nature of the gods under seemingly simple operations! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. "The Fool" is awesome! Our Tarot will be different from other hidden organizations! We use the gods to exchange materials and materials! Audrey almost habitually came to the heart of a "praise beauty", but eventually changed to praise "fool" Mr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger is increasingly alert and enters a mode of calm thinking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Fool's, what do I need to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to analyze the true purpose of the "fool" from the process of the sacrifice ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein right-handedly tapped:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, this is just an attempt, not necessarily Will succeed, so you need your cooperation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First of all, you prepare an altar, not too complicated, it can be very simple, the only requirement is to inscribe or draw this symbol."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a light curtain in front of it, which is a mysterious pattern that symbolizes the hidden "innocent eye" and the "distorted line" symbolizing change, the pattern behind the fool's high back chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a trial without using spiritual materials, Klein determined that his design of the sacrifice ceremony could create an illusory door above the fog, similar to the door of summoning. That kind of, but his own power can not build a stable channel, and it is impossible to call the special space of the mysterious space above the fog to complete the sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he has 90% confidence that the ceremony will ultimately succeed, the only problem is that the channel can be constructed with ordinary spiritual material. Still must be extraordinary materials, enough extraordinary materials? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the "Justice" and "Down" people take the expense of this experiment... Anyway, they knew at the outset that the Tarot itself was a The product of the attempt, the follow-up and other attempts are foreseeable, and the attempt will inevitably fail, even if the gods are no exception... Klein decided to pass the cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When "downside down", "justice" and "the sun" tried to remember that symbol, Klein chuckled: <br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you forget, you can pray to me, and then you can 'remember' it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ok!" Audrey replied briskly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Mr. "The Fool", the ceremony is no longer very tired and troublesome! She thought happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See "Inverted Man" followed by nodding, Klein continued to describe:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Secondly, Follow the normal process, but do not need to burn the herbs, apply the holy oil, do not need to choose a specific time, mourning my name is enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Remember, mourn in ancient Hermes or giant language, and with the following prayers:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your faithful servant prays for your gaze; "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for your acceptance of his dedication;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for you to open the door to the kingdom "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After mourning, combine the spiritual material with the shock of the natural forces caused by the spell, waiting for my response."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this step is not successful, change the material that contains the spirituality to the extraordinary material and try again from the beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;“倒吊人”阿尔Quiet listening, felt before speculation is likely to be close to the truth: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "fool" in a certain dilemma in! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gives an attempt to induce, step by step, trying to use his own and "justice", "the sun", slowly break free from bondage, In the end, He may come to the real world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why he first entered the mysterious space and agreed to establish the true purpose of the Tarot Club! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even without any previous guesses, after listening to this little trial-and-error sacrifice ceremony and comparing it with previous attempts, Alger believes that he will also The same conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing he wants to understand is that Mr. "The Fool" has a powerful leader and there is absolutely no need to use himself and "justice", "the sun", He The leader can do a similar attempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be secrets that I don’t know yet to guess... The attempt must be hidden enough, and his prostitute is watched by some beings? "Inverted people" Alger suddenly imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein described the ceremony, the voice was low but gently asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sacrificial Ceremony There must be a certain amount of time, 'Mr. hangman', when are you going to try?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
