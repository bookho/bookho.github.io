			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein would have liked to ask if Allen or his family had taken back something more unusual before those unlucky things came. Home, such as a little dirty puppet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to the lips, he suddenly felt that this was too direct, and it was easy to expose the fact that he knew quite well in the mysterious field, although this could be explained as a big detective. More knowledgeable, but there is no need to take this risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he switched to a more roundabout way and asked Dr. Allen’s family to suffer misfortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard his question, Alan Cress carefully thought about the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, except for the steam train accidents that followed me, they are the same as before, most of the time they can't be lucky or unfortunate, and the rest are both, not particularly bad."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not right... If it is a doomed puppet that needs to be sealed, it will definitely affect a certain range of people... Is it that Allen has dripped blood on it, so the two sides established A solid connection? In Kline's spirit, Allen's gas field and emotional color are consistent with his physical and mental state, and there is no special place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked at his discretion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the hospital where you work, there is and you "Is it almost unlucky?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, so I think I must have been cursed by someone." Allen pulled the bow tie and looked quite anxious and disturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tali’s curious gaze, Klein thought: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever encountered something strange before you are unlucky? For example, cut yourself? In folklore, blood is a powerful medium for cursing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suspect that after the curse, I have confirmed this. In the last three months, I have not flowed through the blood." Allen replied with a knife and a fork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit strange...and can’t do more complicated divination in front of them... Klein asks again:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what a little weird thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allen, you seriously think about it, this kind of thing is not There may be no reason, have you been offended recently, or have you become a barrier to others?” Talim echoed with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen looked down and looked at the food in the plate, and fell into long-term meditation. Klein was not idle, and it became cold when food became cold. They were solved before eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he started to enjoy the dessert, Allen finally raised his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Not a person who is good at communication, my relationship with my colleagues is not harmonious, but it is hard to believe that they will try to curse me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ... After your reminder, I remembered one thing, it may be related to occultism."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Klein and Tallim At the same time, the spirit rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before the unlucky, I was responsible for a patient, it was a child under ten years old, he was very poor, because some problems need to be cut off Left leg." Allen pushed down the Phnom Penh glasses and recalled, "I haven't been a father for a long time. I am always full of sympathy for the misfortunes of my children. Every time I check the ward, I will talk to him and encourage him. , comfort him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attend, Allen speaks more smoothly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I remember that it was the day before his surgery. I went to the ward to find him. He was really uneasy. He was playing Tarot. This was the item he brought with him when he was admitted to the hospital. He even did not allow his family to take it away." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I let him play Tarot Divination in order to let him relax."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"The child looked at me and smiled very purely and said innocently:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doctor, your luck will be worse."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doctor, your luck will be worse..." Tallim took a breath. "How do I feel that such a scene makes me feel a little bit?" Cold... The child later died on the operating table?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The operation was very successful. It didn't take long before he was discharged. I am especially grateful to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I have never doubted this. Something, but now, after I think about it, I found out that this is the only time I have been in contact with occultism in the last two months. No matter what, no matter what is useful or useless, the tarot card is used for divination." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein doesn’t know when to add a brass-colored coin, it’s jumping and rolling at the fingertips, it seems to symbolize “well-known Detective, "the analysis process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coin bounced and fell, and fell into the palm of his hand. Klein glanced at the corner of his eye and ended the "thinking":<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the child called? Where do you live?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen replied without hesitation:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is Will. Anthony, as for where I live, I don't remember."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Mr. Detective, what is your suggestion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know experts in the field of occultism?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein drank a cup of tea and smiled in the eyes of Allen and Talim:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My advice is, go The church of the god you believe in, telling the bishop about your recent misfortunes, and then asking him if there is a solution, Allen, I remember you, the number, the goddess of the night goddess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost shouted out the goddess, but fortunately I think of my current identity as a detective of the god of steam and machinery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I used to pray to the goddess, to attend mass, and to donate money and goods. It doesn't work. I think I still have to find some fortune-telling diviners. Allen does not agree with the suggestion of Moriarty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thalim echoed and nodded next to him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the gods will not If you are lucky or unlucky, luck is a blessing, and unlucky is a test."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This friend, your faith is not pious, be careful of the Lord of the storm You are lightning... Klein looked at the two and smiled and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This suggestion is based on very simple logic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If, I mean, if there is really a useful occult in the world that can produce results, then the ones that are best at this are definitely the seven orthodox churches. Otherwise, They have long been replaced by other forces that have mastered occultism."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is no such thing as true occultism, look for the diviner, find the witch doctor, I won't get any help, but I don't think there is any solution for the higher-ranking bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen carefully analyzed Next, I finally nodded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It makes sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe need a bishop to help me After the transfer, the goddess will protect me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the accurate description is that with the bishop’s transmission, the night-timers can notice the abnormalities in you... Klein refuted a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t even think about helping Alan himself, because to solve the other’s problems in luck, in addition to finding the root of everything, there must be a certain ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
