			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Townsend Street at the junction of Queens and the West End. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh Dilcha stood in a dark and secluded alley, even if he didn’t look up, he could see the magnificent palaces and towering towers in the distance. Gothic clock tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the highest-lying area of ​​the entire Beckland, and is the royal family of Lun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s in the North and South, the status of the whole world is equal or even slightly higher than the Whitemill Palace in Intis and the Olmer Palace in the Fossac Empire, but The name is neither romantic nor ancient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is called Sodrak Palace. In Guvsak, the word means "balance." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hugh’s eyes were taken back from the famous “Order of the Order” and looked to the other side of the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow of the gas street light, it was slowly coming out of a figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure wears a gold-shell mask that reveals the lower half of the face. It’s the previous sale of the “Sheriff’s Official” formula to Hugh and entrusted her with some tasks from time to time. Mystery man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Hugh and Fols discussed in private, they all suspected that the other party was a military officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a harvest this week?" The man wearing a golden mask asked as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughing and shaking his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no one should have inquired about Kapin before the incident "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused and asked some reluctantly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you want to track down this matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masked man silently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need However, if you have heard about the situation, please contact me immediately.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today I will give you a new assignment. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What mission? "Hugh completely enters the state of the bounty hunter, ready to assess the risk of the matter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masked man laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A very simple task is also the task you dreamed of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You buy the main materials of 'Sheriff' and 'Interrogator' in all your circles, especially the special ones that can be directly blended into potions Materials, if someone responds, we will advance the funds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The purchased materials will belong to me?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is her biggest concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, do you believe that such a simple task can have such a high reward? Of course, if you can fish out the person we are looking for like fishing, get The main material of the potion belongs to you and you can't discuss it." The mask man laughed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I don't know what the main material of the 'interrogator' potion is..." Hugh hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will tell you later, this is our prepaid payment. Even if you don't find the target, you have the main part of the Sequence 7 potion recipe. With a value of more than 600 pounds, I think you have fully realized our generosity." The mask man said in a confused voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really generous...who are they aiming at, why are they willing to spend such a big price to find? Assuming that he is a man of the military affairs, the task of recycling the "arbitrator" in the market is one of the purposes, and there is no problem of wasting money... as a reluctantly experienced bounty hunter Hugh instinctively thought of some things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly weighed, she nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I accept this commission."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." The mask man’s tone became easy and looked around. “The main material of the 'interrogator’ potion is the black snake Corner, the dust of the spirit of the lake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he finished speaking, he slowly retreated and returned to the shadows, disappearing at the corner of the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really told me the main material of the 'interrogator' potion..." I was a little worried about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, she thoroughly understood the power of the mask male representative to pay attention to this task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't know who the target is, the focus seems to be a special material that can be directly deployed into 'Security Officer' and 'Interrogator' potions..." Suddenly stayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembers one thing, that is, when she promotes the sequence 8 "Sheriff", she uses special materials that can be directly blended into the corresponding potions. Special materials purchased through Firth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...this is their goal? Hugh instinctively decided to conceal this thing and never tell the mask man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She licked her cheeks with baby fat and walked out to the street outside, ready to return to the Jowood area by public carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, she saw a brown carriage passing by, and the line of sight was immediately attracted by the coat of arms above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main body of the coat of arms is a flower and two rings, and there is not a special place, but you can look at it with a hurry, and your eyes look like solidification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the carriage was far away, she recovered her sight and her mood became extremely low. Even if she had returned to the house she shared, she did not completely improve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding a friend is not in the right situation, Fols poured two glasses of red wine and took it over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" She sat across from the opposite side and pushed a glass of wine to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hill overlooking the red wine, silent for two minutes before using a slightly hoarse voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the way back, I met a person I had known before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Fols asked very cooperatively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Viscount Stafford." Hugh asked a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folse recalled carefully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This viscount seems to be the court guard?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a best-selling novelist, she can sometimes get invitations from nobles who like literature, participate in afternoon tea and banquets, and follow the professional habits of writers collecting materials. She will definitely take the initiative to do something about the more famous aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this gathering, she met the Viscount of Greenlint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, he used to be the deputy of my father." Hugh said awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your father?" Fols knows that Hugh comes from a broken aristocratic family and has some secrets, but it is not clear about the specific situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the red wine, take a sip and scream a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowed down for a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My family belongs to the court aristocracy, even the most prominent He served as the Earl of the Palace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earl of the Palace? What is this position?" Folls was half curious and asked to let his friends ease their emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is equivalent to the royal spokesperson, the nobleman closest to the throne." The face is gloriously recalled, "Since then, our family has The land that the real count should have, to my father, although not so prominent, is still trusted by the former king, the 'strong man' William VI, the commander of the Royal Guard and the court guard."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her tone is gradually low, with pains that are difficult to conceal:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But seven years ago, he was accused of participating in a The rebellion was eventually sentenced to a hang, depriving the title and the land.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My family is so broken, many members die even without reason. In order to live, we have changed our surname and left East Tuckershire...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I don't believe that my father will be rebellious. He is so loyal to the royal family and even surpasses the belief in the goddess! In order to... In short, I left my mother and my brother and came to Beckland to find opportunities to improve myself, hoping to restore the glory of the family and the reputation of my father. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some of the things in the middle, Hugh said very vaguely, but Fols did not care, sighed: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can be very, very difficult. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately pulled out a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I will support you!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is a mysterious Tarot meeting behind me! She added a sentence to her heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tingen City, No. 2 Narcissus Street at night.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa, who is calculating the math problem, looks at the door and looks at the Banson Road, which has just taken off the half-high hat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where have you been? Is it not the result of the announcement tomorrow? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I can hear you tonight, and I just know the two city government employees responsible for the unified exam. "Banson hooked his mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of December, he signed up for the unified examination of government employees, picking a relatively competitive position, and In this process, relying on eloquence and communication skills, friendships have been established with several government employees and many candidates.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the result? Melissa unconsciously put down the round pen in her hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson’s expression suddenly sinks, but before Melissa’s opening, he But there is a bright smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And is the top position!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is great..." Melissa stood up and took two steps. "You have to start preparing for the second round of exams at the end of January. This is in Beckland. You have to pack your luggage in advance...when are you going to leave?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at my sister’s worry, Benson walked into the living room and smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan is that after the New Year, we will go to Bakerland and rent a house there.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am prepared to stay in Baekeland regardless of the success of the exam." De, try to sway, and you can take the New Year holiday and transfer to the technical school in Beckland to prepare for the Beckland University of Technology and Technology entrance exam in June. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a month ago, the Beckland Institute of Technology was reorganized and officially upgraded to the University of Technology and Technology.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa listened quietly, and unknowingly picked up her lips.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked around in a circle, her voice answered very lightly道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday afternoon, the Cragg Club.<br />< Bryan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein came out and hired a carriage to the Red Rose Manor of Prince Edessac.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was Tali A place that I often go a few days before my death, as a qualified detective, I don’t want to do an investigation. I am totally sorry for the 100 pounds I have received.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what Negative absenteeism, the look is still to be done... Klein is sitting in the carriage, enjoying the scenery with less pollution outside the window, and swearing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the morning In practice, he roughly grasped the extent of improvement in various aspects: the extraordinary ability of "manipulating the flame" and "flame jumping" became stronger by about 30%, and the power of the air bomb and the length of the pipeline for underwater false breathing even doubled. Divination and fighting have also been significantly enhanced.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
