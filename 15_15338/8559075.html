			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the silent silence, Amyrius quickly took control of his expression, with a majestic and profound voice, saying:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me the specific process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not make too much concealment, first from Auston Levitt The inquiry begins, then mentions that the dream is warned by the mysterious person, saying that you should not oppose the choice of the trend history of the times, and then simply talk about the sudden telegram, and finally the change of Cynthia, the situation on the scene, the arrogance of the secretary. The self-response and subsequent investigations are roughly described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His concealed content was only February 4th, his first day of arrival on Olawe Island, and the corresponding speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the specific battle, he also said very vague, I believe that Admiral Amyrius can understand, after all, what an extraordinary person is good at, what are unique The ability is one of the biggest secrets of its own. If it is leaked out, it is understood, it is arranged in a targeted manner, and it may even die in the hands of enemies lower than its own sequence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below the high sequence, many extraordinary people can be very powerful or vulnerable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amyrius was quietly listening, and his face did not see any change in the dimly lit room, but the fact that he had not interrupted in the middle and asked himself could explain some situations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, he condensed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mysterious person who invaded your dreams Emphasizing the fate of the times, and the trend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Klein has restored the face of German Sparrow, not deliberately explaining The mysterious man did not mention the specific plan of Auston Levitt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amyrius is silent again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You keep me in your dreams Look like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this is my secret." Klein replied succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amyrius is not so obvious. He took a few steps in a small area and revisited to Greman Sparo:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your choice, no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When heard this, Klein seems to have gotten In the end, the most effective feedback, the body of the potion has been digested a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the low voice, Amyrius leaned over the body and turned his eyes to the window, saying without emotion:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't intend to sign a contract with the substitute, but I was going to inform Cynthia that there was a sign of out of control and I couldn't get close to her within five days, but then some reasons made me change my mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no forcible limitation of the temporary contract, even if I can persist in the usual temptation, I can’t resist the desire to enlarge last night...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Cynthia knows in advance that after 5 days of restriction, she will not be eager to take the powder that is made by the "breeding necklace", so that she will not sense the "desire mother tree", but it will change...but In this way, the initiative is in the hands of the celestial sect, they can find other excuses to let Cynthia take food...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is really for me Come here... What do you want to do with the "Desire Mother Tree", and what is the reason for Admiral Amyrus A crucial change... Klein vaguely grasped the key and looked at the side of Amyrius:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the reason?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amyrius does not speak with a little expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to know."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... For the first time, Klein hated this response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, he took out the broken pendant and threw it to Amyrius:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"This is the 'breathing necklace' derived from the 'desire mother tree'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amyrius raised his hand and looked down and looked down:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can leave.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Go to Bilt to collect your reward. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not worried that I know something that I shouldn’t know? Also, Auston’s plot has been revealed, known by political opponents, and Ai Mirius clearly did not participate, so I did not understand the problem is not big... Klein thought that there will be a long-term confidentiality contract, who knows that it can leave.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that Amyrius did not take the initiative to mention another thing, so he pointed to the other side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clothing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admiral Amyrius raised his head and silently took off the tuxedo suit with shirt and vest.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein originally wanted to make extra compensation for the difficulty of this task beyond the pre-agreed boundaries, but vaguely can confirm that Cynthia’s affairs have come from their own guilty This plan. He quickly took off the comfortable nightgown, put on the swallowtail dress, followed the guidance of Amyrius, jumped out of the window, and quietly left in a situation where the guard did not know what was "invisible". This garden villa.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amyrius put on the nightgown, hold the "breeding necklace", walked to the window and looked at the red moon in the night And a few stars, standing silent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood there without expression, and has not changed his position for a long time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;啪!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His left hand slightly loosened, the reduced rhinoceros-like rupture pendant immediately The state of the fragments falls to the ground, one by one, one by one.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At noon the next day, Klein left the hotel with a good night's sleep, took the carriage to the "sweet lemon" bar, and saw Bilt Brando in the room on the second floor.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The end of the matter? "Bilter asked a little bit more pleasantly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Admiral Amyrius is back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the rest of the reward?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilter reveals an unspeakable smile in the bodyguard When he was sent outside the door, he went to the safe and took out the 500-pound tail and a blue cuff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a magical item made by the fisherman you provided." Bilt said, "It provides a magical scale hidden under the skin, letting you It's hard to be caught like a fish, and it can help you with some damage. With it, you can dive at least 15 meters without protection and 10 minutes freely under water. Its negative effect is not big, just let you Hot or dry places are more likely to be exhausted than normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, this cuff and "sun brooch" should not be mixed... Klein reaches out I have taken over money and things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't worry about having problems?" Bilt made a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your industry is here," Klein replied plainly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His meaning is simple, that is, there is a problem, not afraid to find the person responsible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilt’s smile was stiff for a second, and instead:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has no name yet You can give it one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fish man's cuff." Klein didn't waste brain cells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...good name, very image." Bilt laughed forcibly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'artisan' said he could The ritual of summoning spiritual creatures solidifies on spiritual materials for up to a year and a half, but requires detailed information.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, according to the agreement, the money is paid by me, you don't have to worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, make a harmonica." Klein took the paper out of his pocket. Pen, brush brush wrote a ceremony to summon his own messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The messenger? This is quite rare. It’s hard for the extraordinary person outside the path of death to find the right messenger." Bilt took the paper and glanced at it. "Oh, if you accidentally summoned a messenger at the time of production, you need to give her a gold coin... What if you don't give it? Oh, the spiritual world is always a strange place, I have seen music that is particularly fond of music. I have also seen it beside the manure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about not giving? Maybe Ms. Renett Nikol will bring you and the head of the 'artisan'. She is a creature with a castle in the spiritual world. Maybe it is stronger than me. Well, I don't use the "Poseidon Scepter". In the case... Klein whispered a few words, said in a deep voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The third item production commitment, later."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Bilt did not disagree with this, and then asked curiously, "Mr. Gelman, how did you conceal the Luerian that was mentioned by Admiral Amirus? Secretary, Governor Auston and Miss Cynthia?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Klein tried to keep his skin twitched:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the information, seriously try to figure out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not specifically tell, stood up, took a hat, and gave a gift:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy cooperation." Bilt responded with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing the back of Gilman Sparo disappearing from the door, he shook his head and laughed and said to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This powerful and crazy adventurer turned out to be a natural drama actor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After lunch, his men came. Today's newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilter sipping a cigar while looking at it, his expression suddenly solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last night, the new Governor Ben Conrad held a banquet in the mansion... The new Governor? Auston Levitt was dismissed from the Governor?" Bill Specially picked up the remaining newspapers and saw the same news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his network of resources in Olavi, the Governor has replaced this big thing, he should have heard it for a long time, but this time, things happened extremely suddenly. Most people did not know the situation until the new Governor officially appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, a colleague who secretly served Admiral Amyrius entered the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The general will let you inspect the people around you, find out all the believers of the celestial sects, and sink them into the sea." The collaborator conveyed Ai Miliu Sri Lanka’s instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Bilt asked, "What happened? The celestial sect suffered a heavy blow yesterday."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Admiral was assassinated by the celestial sect, Miss Cynthia was killed, the secretary of Luer An was injured, and the general guard lost a lot of people." The collaborator simply described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Bilt was a little bit stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, isn’t this the focus of attention mentioned by Admiral Amyrius? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also specifically emphasized to Greman Sparo...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Cynthia Miss was killed, the secretary of Luer An was injured, and Auston Levitt was dismissed from the position of the Governor... Bilt’s expression was stunned and moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital of East Chester County, Stowe City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey quietly listened to the words of a noble lady, and from time to time echoed two sentences and gave a solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
