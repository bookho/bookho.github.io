			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 pm, Olive Tree Avenue, Pamel's Divination Cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger Wilson pushed the teak door with a glass of glass above and entered the occult-themed cafe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked for a cup of Fairmer coffee from the Pas River Valley on the South China Sea Plateau, and took the tarot card he had bought before. Next to it, the top one is the "upside down man" card, depicting an angel who is tied up with both hands and hangs upside down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the morning, he has changed his dress, wearing a classic dark robe, wearing a soft cap of a top cleric, as if from a folklore A wizard or magician who came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a silent breath, Alger slowly tasted the coffee and was not waiting for anyone’s anxiety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about five or six minutes, the brown wooden door inlaid with thick glass was once again open, coming in a black coat, wearing a half-high silk hat. man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman’s appearance is less than 30, his face is thin, his edges are sharp, and he has both mature and gloomy qualities. It is a fine-tuning of the appearance and changes to some people. Set up Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not wear gold-rimmed glasses, but his eyesight was not affected. His eyes swept away and fell to the dark blue corner of Alger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kline’s gaze moved down and saw the “upside down” card at the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without words, he walked straight, took off his hat, sat across from Alger, and smiled sullenly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, he has already taken the appearance of the Tarot Club veteran member:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facial features are profound, the outline is rough, there is obvious rain and the color of the wind, at first glance it is a type that can be played more often, and often runs around;<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skin is partial to bronze, but it is different from the local race, like the result of the pure Lun people's perennial sun and rain, but the dark blue hair is more special, not Lun, closer to the colony of the Devil's Bay in the raging sea area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hybrid... Klein made a judgment in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger looked at the opposite man, slowly overlapping him with the image of the "world", and then launched the tarot card, said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This requires you to shuffle and cut cards yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein reached up and picked up, I looked at them all together, then put them together, and shuffled them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cuts the cards in succession, draws three, and sets them into past, present and future cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned back slowly, but his right hand turned over the tarot card in the middle, with a naked, only purple scarf The woman is surrounded by a green garland like a threshold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "world" card numbered 21, and the 22nd is back to 0, symbolizing "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you interpret it?" Klein asked deliberately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although "the hanging man" did not explicitly mention that the "world" is the leader of the "fool", Klein believes that there is no need to be lucky in this regard. The mind, calmly revealing is more conducive to the establishment of the image - if the other party has not yet guessed, this is a sincere and emboldened performance, if Alger has already known, this can make the "world" look calm, it seems that everything is in its own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, know that I know? Before he raised the topic above the fog, he believed that I could guess? Awkward... Alger’s heart screamed, and the speed of speech did not respond slowly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Reverse, indicating that things will fail due to insufficient preparation.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What preparations do you have to make?" Klein nodded thoughtfully and asked one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger took back all the tarot cards outside the "world" and skillfully reshuffled and cut cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he opened the top card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a "Pope" card! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger's voice is still low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You need advice, need faith and religious help, Avoid going into the wrong path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Klein’s opening, he opened the second card in order, with the moon on the ground ":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will be confused, you will be bored, you will be paralyzed in a dream, but this is only temporary."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, Alger gave the third tarot card, which is a "sun" card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everything will pass, the light will shine on the earth." He said like a god stick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was silent for a few seconds and asked: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Church, Dreamland, Sun ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger’s face showed a smile, and nodded lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Tarot divination, he contained hints of follow-up plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, with the situation that he has not entered the game now and is not paying attention at all, there is absolutely no need to be so euphemistic, he can directly tell the specific content, but Alger feels Or try the "world" leader to see if he has enough brains, not more to rely on force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the IQ of both parties is at the same level, Alger believes that more cooperation can be done in the future, and there is no need to talk too much between smart people. On the contrary, he will try to Don't let the "world" deeply participate in your own affairs. When you need to beat, ask him to help, unless Mr. "fool" has another order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the answer to the "World" and previous performances have made him confirm that the other party is very strong and experienced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I am a tarot expert... In this respect, you are just getting started with Mr. "Hanging Man"... Klein laughed and fell in his heart. The other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "inverted man" hidden in the interpretation of the content is very simple, "Pope" means that he wants to "flame" Daniz and "steel "Maviti's matter was reported to the Storm Church, and the enemy was divided by the power of the "Password" to take advantage of the profits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Klein’s usual approach, and understanding is not difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following "Moon" and "Sun" cards are reminders of "downside down":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the introduction of "the punitive", it must be guarded against this, and according to Alger’s experience, when dealing with similar problems, his colleagues in Bayam will definitely use one to force The seals that allow many people to enter the dream, the characteristics of the "steel" Maviti determine the emergence of targeted items in the "sun" field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I restrained the dream, not afraid of the "sun"... Klein reached out and turned the reverse "world" card in front of it into a full circle. This means that this plan is feasible and I will be prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger raised his head and took a breath:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The owner here is good at aromatherapy You can use the fragrance of different essential oils, pure dew, incense, and flower essence to treat the corresponding emotional problems and smooth the restless mind. Do you want to give it a try?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Using the contact point of Xiangshu Avenue? Klein smiles and responds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see me, I see you No one has moved, no mention of aromatherapy, everything is in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't stay too much, took out his pocket watch and glanced at it, and slowly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger converges on a smile and presses his chest with his hand. He whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let us praise the gods, all the divination results are derived from the revelation provided by Him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哟, also knows the table is loyal... Klein endured a smile, imitating the "downside down" Alger's look, and responded seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us praise the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went two steps, suddenly paused, looked back Looking at Alger, he laughed with a hat: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Frankly, you are not suitable for this kind of dress."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? Alger failed to keep up with the idea of ​​Mr. "World." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein Ramen stepped out of the theme cafe, Alger took his eyes and looked at the mirror in the corner, taking a hard look at his current dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t think that there was any problem with this. After being quoted by the “world”, he became more and more uncoordinated and finally understood why the other person’s Say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A guy who looks very rough and windy, seems to be able to call a hundred sailors at a time to smash each other or take out an axe and cut down a piece of guy Really should not wear such a mysterious classical wizard robes, the temperament is very violated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wave Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In returning to the original clothing, Alger followed the prayers of the believers, entered the hall in a low-key manner, used the opportunity of confession, and met the parish bishop Joeo through the responsible pastor. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ceremony, he said bluntly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I met the 'flame flame' Dani Here, he claims that the key of 'Iceberg Lieutenant' has nothing to do with the treasure of death, and is even willing to sell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has commissioned me to pay attention to 'Steel' Mai Wei As for the whereabouts, he seemed to have been injured in the second hand of the 'blood' and was eager to get rid of the other party's recourse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Jogori, I want to reveal this news, so that 'Steel' Maviti and his men can successfully block the 'flame' Dani Here, we take this opportunity to capture all of them or kill them on the spot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This can effectively combat the arrogance of pirates. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jogore reveals an expression of appreciation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, your ability to do things" It is much better than I expected. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger replied devoutly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is all from the Lord's Guide Also benefit from your teachings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will find the right person to reveal the news in the evening. If I come to pray again, it means that 'Steel' Maviti has no action at the moment. If I don't show up again, it means that he or his subordinates have taken control to prevent the news from leaking, which means they will enter the fishing net."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the location and other matters, Alger returned to the confession room and left normally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7:15 in the evening, the fragrant leaves bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wearing a wide-leg trousers, wrapped in a dark blue hair with a headscarf, Alger holding a cup of "strong Lang Qi", standing next to the boxing ring, implicitly ridiculously Look at the two players with a bruised face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he found the target coming in and went straight to the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly waiting, Alger sat next to the thin, dark man, and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I heard that 'Steel' came to Baiam?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man was alert and replied, and the smile replied with a smile:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
