			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"喵呜!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cat’s voice echoed in a secluded woods On the open ground, whether it is an adult black robe man or a teenager of 15 or 6 years old, both eyes are on the dead body lying in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold cold wind blew, the black cat fell to the ground, staring at the human who had just thrown it out, constantly sweeping the tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, its hair blew again, then slammed with both feet and fled in the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, all that it did did not attract the slightest attention. The human beings were all looking at the moving body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, the dead body does not have any changes to look forward to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you failing again?" A teenager leaned over and squatted down and poked the skin of the dead body with his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No response." He turned his body halfway and said to the black robe man and other companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he felt a gust of wind blowing from his bottom to his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After brushing, the dead body sat up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager was shocked and immediately cheered with surprise:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Successful! Successful ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice did not fall, the dead body suddenly grabbed his shoulder, pressed him into his arms, then opened his mouth, biting Going down, biting out the sound of snoring, biting blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! Help!" The young man was horrified and screamed, exhausted his whole body, but could not break free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead body lifted his head, revealing White's teeth, as well as the minced meat hanging between the teeth and the blood flowing through his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe man was first stunned, and immediately took out a brass-colored whistle, which was contained in his mouth and blew it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he used the Hermes language: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I command you in the name of death! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound echoed, the dead body stopped biting, and it was stiff in the short term. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neck and shoulders were bitten with flesh and blood. The teenager was also soft and there seemed to have lost his soul, and the soil in his lower body was moist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really..." The black robe man whispered a surprise, pointing at the dead body, again using the Hermes language, "Get up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead body suddenly stood up, then opened his arms and ran to the depths of the secluded woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Return!" The black robe man was surprised and shouted, but did not find signs of a pause in the dead body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was busy blowing a whistle and shouting in awe-inspiring manners:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am dying In the name of the order you come back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his words, the back of the dead body disappeared into the trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I let you come back..." The black robe man stayed in the same place, silly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the woods, Klein held the Azick copper whistle and the matchbox in one hand, igniting the match in one hand, smashing his wrist and throwing it on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, he retreated backwards in an arc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face was white and the stench of the dead rushed over, and the unspoken eyes stared straight at the old and delicate copper whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stepped back, snoring and aiming at the dead body, simulating the sound:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead body swayed a bit, and there was a penetrating wound in the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein once again exhaled and made an air bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! The head of the dead body was broken by a small half, and there was a rotting liquid that dripped down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this is not a fatal injury to it, and the running of the cockroach is only slightly stagnant and reappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing this situation, Klein took a step back and made a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bright flame swelled from the ground, just covering the dead body and igniting its coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead body rushed through the flames and continued on, like a mad cow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Snapped! Snapped! Klein slammed his fingers and let the ground spurt another red flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead body rushed through these flames without pain, and the body gradually began to burn, and it became more and more intense, giving people a feeling of melting in the candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the dead body that turned into a torch rushed to Klein and grabbed the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, a flame swelled up and wrapped it with Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead body grabbed Klein’s shoulder, but only pinched the broken Mars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's figure dissipated in the red flame, the fire that appeared at the farthest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dead body seems to have finally exhausted all the strength, no longer struggling, in the dark green flames, melted into the ashes and oil wax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is better than all the living corpses and grievances I have encountered before, um, not as good as Mr. Azick's descendants...if it wasn't me, they are today I’m going to die here.” Klein shook his head and walked through the woods, heading for the open space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the man in black robes noticed the changes in the woods and turned and fled without hesitation, and the seven or eight teenagers were first And scattered, can run and find that there is only one person around, and timidly stopped, returned to the original place, gathered together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After experiencing the death of dead bodies, they bite flesh and blood, they really dare to run alone in the deep night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will make them feel cool behind their necks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They look at me, I see you, no one dares to help the boy with a flesh and blood on his neck and shoulders, afraid that the other person will become a living corpse at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heartbeat is like a short silence in drumming. They suddenly saw a clown wearing a flaming dress and red, yellow and white paint in the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the illusion that Klein made directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and didn’t chase the black robe man, hoarse and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is hosting the ceremony just now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who? The young men and women seem to have not recovered, and it took a few seconds to launch a big boy who shivered and replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He claims to have a deep research on death, to lead us to find the mystery of eternal life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original teacher in the school...the mystery of eternal life? It’s really bragging without paying taxes... From the performance just now, this guy will not be a “psychic”, at most “diggers”, maybe even only sequence 9, just a corpse... Of course, he may not be a god of death In the way, just join the spiritual group because of worship... Klein asked clearly where Coptic lived and thought: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go back Don't take part in this kind of thing, don't let it go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Otherwise, you will all die."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he emphasized it again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The young men and women who have been scared by the previous incidents nodded madly, relying on each other to prepare to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a girl with a smooth hair pointed at the painful companion on the ground:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "He, is he okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no time to die, but you must take it to the doctor, and you are said to be bitten by a carnivorous dog." Klein stopped paying attention to them and returned to the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young men and women looked at each other and asked someone to blurt out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me, may I ask, What do you call it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and deliberately misled the other side and replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I am just a janitor in hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While he was talking, there was a mist that suddenly spread, and the figure disappeared into place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hell's janitor?" The young men and women whispered the word, and they were thoughtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, after a sip of the bone marrow-like cold wind, they shivered again, and they helped the companion, and they did not dare to return to the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a member of the Spiritual Order? It’s really disappointing... If he didn’t give up his current status, I will go to visit him in the middle of the night to see what he knows. Well, I have to give him a lesson so that he won’t dare to suffer again. Can dance and resurrection rituals be playable? Klein habitually judged by the thinking of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he returned to the loft Caroman mansion and waited patiently for security personnel to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just found the opportunity, he immediately turned over the fence, quickly approached the house along the shadows, and quietly climbed the balcony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the dummy pretending to be his wife is still smoking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Klein tapped his finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure in front of him immediately turned into a thin piece of paper and floated to his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper is covered with rust red marks and can no longer be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t dare to throw it, folded it, and stuffed it into the pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he leisurely stepped into the hallway and returned to the bedroom of Arturo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you go for so long?" Stuart asked in a whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just went to the door and found out that Sherlock Moriotti smoked one cigarette after another, but he was not responsible for leaving the bedroom. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
