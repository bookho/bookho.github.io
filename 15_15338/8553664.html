			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey, who thought he knew the truth, couldn’t help but imagine the scene described by Viscount Glylint:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhous fell in the darkness, in the mud, covered with one after another tarot cards, there are "fools", "justice", "downside down", There are "sun" and "world". There are other main cards and many digital cards. They have some inversions, some are in the right position, some have not been opened, just the back is just like a big surprise. Tarot divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This picture is definitely shocking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know where the “Justice” card will fall...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military What do the extraordinary people of the church think about this thing? Will you feel that there are new hidden organizations? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhous is in the divine nature of the "real creator", and he and the aurora will certainly not be small, if successful, will inevitably give Baekeland De, will bring terrible disaster to the kingdom, and such a plot is so light and so flat, it was suspended, and a simple task issued by Mr. "Footer" was suspended! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the game of the god level? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool" and "Real Creator" are deadly enemies? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that He calls the other party “the fallen creator”...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One idea flashed quickly, and Audrey’s body faintly had some undetectable tremors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you thinking?" The Priest, who was sitting opposite, finally couldn't stand it, wondering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey stunned back and smiled a little:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not you let I imagine the scene of the body covered with tarot cards?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha." Glylint smiled and sighed, "I don't know." It is the imagination of a member of a secret organization that is very much in line with my imagination of similar things, too, too cool!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is us Tarot will! Audrey answered silently and smiled lightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe a powerful person who has no organization and acts alone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter what, I like this style! You urge Hugh and Fols, ask them when my 'pharmacist' formula can be found?" Glalin is quite excited Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey's eyes wide open, looking around, pressing down the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet , whisper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can you tell the potion recipe here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glylint smiled uncomfortably: "Reassured, this is nothing. I have already confirmed it. There is only one dog except you and me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; Jin Mao big dog Su Shi did not consciously change the sitting posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bakerland North, one of the bottoms of St. Seychelles Church In the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wearing a black hooded robes, painted with blue eyeshadows and blush, shows a fascinating and glamorous Dai Li casually looking for a position to sit Next, picked up the documents on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She swept over her eyes, her eyes suddenly solidified, and immediately her brows wrinkled, suppressing what she asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Lalhous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why didn't you inform me about the action last night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crested in the main position, re-sliding his chin and lips in the vertical collar of Crestel. Sesima has a low voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am worried that you can't control your emotions, which will bring unnecessary hidden dangers to the action, so no one tells you ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand your feelings very well, the Tingen team has a night-time person who is instructed and trained in the church, ready to join the 'red gloves', his The performance is similar to yours, but as the person in charge of the action, as a senior deacon of the night, I must exclude the factors of instability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily looked The other night squad leader and deacon who was summoned to the eye, sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you think I can't control my emotions? I am very calm. I won't be impulsive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My anger will only break out after Llanus is caught! Is a senior value night, a professional loyalty of a deacon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I catch Llanus, I will let him know that men are also very Fragile! I will have a cold, rotten but stiff body behind his butt. I will have a white bone in front of his body that is full of barbs and stench. I will let those cold guys come in and out of him. Where to get in and out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! You just let him die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cresté Sesimma looked at Dai Li calmly, listened to her words silently, and then sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long have you been patient? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delly snorted and suddenly whispered like a deflated ball:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "For a long time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sésima regained his sight and looked to other deacons and team captains:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter? reward? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" We initially confirmed that the person who killed Llanus is a member of the Secret Society, the order is sequence 8, the name of the potion is a clown, good at Use a card to make a flying knife. "A deacon said truthfully, "However, we can't be sure of this speculation. The tarot cards on the body are not like what to cover up. After all, the extraordinary person did not deal with the wall and Llanus's head at the same time. The cards, we all think that the final scene is closer to a certain ritual or symbol, so we suspect that the extraordinary person may belong to an organization that we don't know yet. Of course, the scene may also be his personal special habit. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sésima slightly nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can start from this, follow-up survey. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ayr, what did the investigation of the whistleblower find? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Al Hasen, who is very attractive to middle-aged men, flips the paper path in his hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We investigated the whistleblower and found that his actions stemmed from the intent of a bounty hunter. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the process of finding wanted lord Llanus, the companion of the bounty hunter was killed by the members of the Aurora, she secretly After conducting a survey, the goal was finally locked at the Workers Union Pub in East Byron Dock, and Llanus was discovered according to the target's trajectory. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her actions are basically confirmed by the witness side, there is no strange place, we also confirmed by extraordinary means, she and killed Lalhous The lack of connections. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is hiding now, hard to find. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sésima seems to add in a thoughtful way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is in line with Langer The description of Us, the radically crazy Aurora members are a help to him. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another team leader of the night squad reported: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is a fake reporter. The news from the police department shows that he is actually a private detective. The Mike Joseph reporter who helped the Daily Observer was investigating the killing of Hibel. We suspected that he had obtained a clue and found the dock union, so he disguised himself in contact with everyone suspected of being a murderer." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guess has been confirmed by Essinger Stanton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secima Well, I turned to the other people who had recently contacted Llanus and got answers without any questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the end, he said with a discretion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Larousus was killed enough The motives that make me very confused, the mysterious murderer deserves attention, and you continue to follow up on this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, according to common sense, Aurora will be in Baker The rand of Rand is certainly not the only one of the 'Royal Bishop' 'hidden monks' level, there will be at least one god, even a saint."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" They failed to meet the 'real creator' advent. With their crazy and irrational characteristics, I am worried that they will make a series of retaliations. Recently you must be highly alert and I will stay in Bakerland. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Lord Sesima." A deacon and team leader responded seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creite. Sesima paused for a few seconds, adding:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mei Gaoousi incident of the roots and the Lalhous incident last night all revealed a problem. The factory area, the dock area and the eastern area have become hotbeds for the evil spirits to come and gestate. You assign personnel to investigate and collect the most authentic conditions. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is exactly the same as what Lairus describes, I will raise this matter at the cardinal meeting and formally put pressure on the kingdom and the government to promote The corresponding changes are implemented as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sleeps very late Get out of bed, but the outside is still not bright enough, still covered with a faint mist, dark and damp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not in line with my splendid mood... He muttered, changed his clothes, took the keys, and returned to Minsk Street without any attention. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After changing the uniform of the worker to a shirt sweater at home and confirming that no one was investigating himself as a private detective, he completely let go and leisurely went out to the meat. Shop for food and prepare a hearty lunch for yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, Beckland had some sunshine, and Klein lazily basking in the sun, and seemed to have nothing to do for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 2:45, he took a look at the gold-shelled pocket watch and returned to the bedroom to get into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the emergence of the "world" dummies, after re-familiar with the operational skills, he sat on the top of the high back chair and sent it to the "Sun" classmates. A reminder to prepare for the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland time at 3 o'clock, a deep red glow in the grand and ancient palace, sketching the same blurred figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey looks directly at the head and talks lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon , 'Mr. Fool'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'simple' task you commissioned was completed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; She deliberately added an accent on the word "simple", that is, to confirm from the "fool" Mr. Langus is not removed by his leader, the death scene covered with tarot cards is not the tower The iconic symbol of Luo Hui. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pretending to smile plainly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
