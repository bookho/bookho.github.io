			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the familiar scene description, Audrey can almost confirm that this is the leader of Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a strong sense of substitution, participation and pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bloody and sinful trafficker... The “trial” card is a trial of justice for him, the result of which is hanged, broken Punishment, or fire? The "Emperor" card should be a sign of identity... This is the leader who sneaked into the Kingdom Museum and stole the "Black Emperor" card? For a time, Audrey floated together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was going to ask for more details and a more detailed process, but she understood from the expression, tone and emotional color of Father Hall’s Earl that he was not yet Knowing what happened, I had to press doubts and curiosity, and I was going to ask for a friend from the service army, Constance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although directly asking for Const’s inquiry is in line with my image in this respect, but in that case, it is still somewhat awkward and slightly contradicts the identity of the nobility. ...... Let Anne prepare a few afternoon tea invitations, respectively, to Glylint, Constance, Murray, Christine, Jane... Most of them are interested in occult, against Grand Theft Auto The name "Black Emperor" will not have no feeling. Under my guidance, I can help me to ask a lot of questions that I am not convenient to ask... It is so decided... Audrey took back the attention and enjoyed the breakfast with a small mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She believes that the "fool"'s leader will not deal with Kapyeong purely to punish evil, which is not in line with his identity, of course, if it is A month ago, Audrey, who had just joined the Tarot Club, would definitely accept a similar explanation, otherwise she would not pick the "justice" card to be her own symbol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having experienced many meetings, after a lot of things, she felt that she has matured a lot, not so simple, she thinks that this thing must be hidden inside More critical and more essential factors, such as which evil spirits involved in Kapyeong, or which secret organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that Const can provide useful news... Audrey is full of expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 Minsk Street, Klein is eating smeared jam White bread, looking at today's newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Safe?" Looking at him, he almost blurted out and almost swallowed himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not, I don’t have it, don’t say it... Klein immediately used the form of Sanlian in his heart to deny the description of all the belongings in the safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, the situation was urgent. In order to obtain clues, although he found the safe, he only went in to see if there were any important documents and evidence, and did not take any Property, and quickly left there, transferred to another room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Klein of the spirit state suffered a certain injury in the explosion caused by the gas, and the total weight of the items that can be carried dropped a lot. There are only gold bars, jewels, title deeds, deeds and antiques in the safe, which are either inconvenient to take or impossible to get rid of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe he still has a place to put cash, but unfortunately I didn’t meet it, and I didn’t have time to look for it... Klein silently sighed and confirmed the insurance. All the belongings in the cabinet are some follow-up investigators. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the newspaper and drank the Xibe black tea. He slowly vomited and smiled in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grand Theft" Black Emperor...This title I like..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When breakfast is used, Klein wears a thick double-breasted length Dress, take a half-high silk hat and black hard cane, open the door and leave Minsk Street, go to the Axe Lane on the edge of the East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the place where Daisy is missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finalizing the plan, before he put it into action, he also deliberately went to the Axe Lane, seriously looking for clues and knocking on many houses around. The door asks if they have seen a girl like Daisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some families may still have some savings, and they can afford other detectives. I am a good-hearted person who took over yesterday. The probability of being suspected is extremely low. As long as I am not suspected, I will not be in the case of the last Lalhous. The performance is compared... And, the last time it was dispatched was the night servant, and it was assisted by the special department of the military. This time in the Jowood area, the custodian should be taken over, and the communication between them would not be so smooth... Well, Katie and Parker are the "arbitrators" approach, and I don't know if the military will insert a hand... As a former night singer, Klein has behavior patterns, work styles and investigation habits for several official organizations. Sufficient understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, I have excellent anti-detection capabilities... Klein laughed and boarded the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will continue to investigate the disappearance of the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he is an ordinary private detective who has not confirmed that Missi is missing and is related to Kapyeong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 9 am, Daisy is accompanied by police in charge of surrounding neighborhoods , returned to the dilapidated apartment that was rented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was placed in a church in the Jowood area with the same poor girl last night and accepted the inquiry, including their escape When they came out, they looked back at what they saw, where they lived separately, how the family was, how they felt that they were not too ordinary friends, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still in the panic and fear of emotions, the truth answered those questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is looking for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slept in the middle of the night and was sent to the Eastern District in the early morning and handed it to the fierce policeman she often saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, Daisy did not dare to speak, and there was some trepidation. When she entered the apartment where she was, she felt a little comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just stepped into the door and found her mother and sister through the wet clothes she was hanging, and she heard a scream:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"黛西!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freya put down his work, like an agile little deer, escaped Half empty clothes and debris on the ground quickly ran to the door and hugged my sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, she let go of her hand, shed tears, and looked up and down with surprise and worry:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you okay?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Great, you are finally back! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifu also stood up from the washtub and rubbed his hands on his clothes, rubbing his eyes:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wuxi, where have you been in these days? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the policeman interjected: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She was kidnapped, We saved her back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, thank you! You are too, great! Liv shed tears and used adjectives.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police coughed two channels:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is our duty... Have you encountered any strange people in recent days?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liv squatted for a second, and there was one less thing to do, and I didn't want to add trouble to the mind:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, really no. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policeman waved his hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful! Don't leave the path of no one! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn't stand the damp and mixed flavors here, and immediately turned away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"It’s good to come back, just come back..." She whispered in tears, not asking if Daisy had been hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daisy relaxes, sobbing and crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freia next to it also shed tears, stretched out his hands and hugged his mother and sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother and the daughter cried for a while and each loosened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liv once again wiped his eyes: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First wash laundry, there are many. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly rescued thing nodded and quickly plunged into the busy work." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been until noon, they are carrying black bread, drinking white water that can hardly be called tea, Liv has no time to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Daisy, are you injured?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛西摇头道:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They just hit me a few times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's great! The police rescued you? Yesterday there was a bit The kind-hearted detective is willing to help you for free. As a result, you are back today, ah, your word book is still there for him." Fryia said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liv had prepared a sentence: "I will ask Old Kohler to come back and tell the detective that you have gone home so that he does not have to be busy again." This matter, no matter what, we have to say thank you again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛West put down the worry and turned to answer my sister’s question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not the police, there was a sudden explosion there, and the door that locked us was opened strangely. We ran out like that, but we saw the roof station. A gentleman, or a lady.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He wore black armor, a crown-like helmet, and a cloak, so he watched us quietly. None of them are broken to stop us and catch up with us. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a "guide" for free schools, Daisy's vocabulary is significantly more abundant than that of her mother.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"A wear, such a person saved you? Liv asked in a strange way, Frya was curious and waiting for the answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛西 seriously nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, he is like, like in the bard population...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hero!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hero...Freia chewed the word, eyes bright as stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a secret room, a group of people holding the information they sent, Carefully compare the Llanus case with the Kapin case and look for commonalities in behavioral motives and modus operandi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two things can't be linked at all. The only thing in common is that evil, or sin is defeated, and the owner of the tarot card upholds justice. Someone exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is certain that the two hands are not one person, the strength is obviously different, and the ones are better at different, although this may be because the sequence itself has improved, but It is not common for the murderer of the Kapin case to belong to the grievances, or to switch the spirit state." Another person's analysis received the majority recognition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the convener concluded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two cases, two different people, They all throw tarot cards, maybe the latter imitate the crime, so that we can target the insiders of the Llanus case, and the other may be that there is an organization!<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A organization symbolized by tarot cards! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
