			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Edwina’s gaze easing, Anderson sketched his mouth and shook his head and sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You, always so rigid, so you can't be an artist all your life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a sigh of relief, he looked to the corpse on the ground chair: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can't always look at it, we have to do something. Is Xiatasi not looking for her family? Just buried her on the island of Sunia. Near the ruins of the elves. Mobett seems to want to be with Xiatasi, then put it in the same grave.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Longzel is not trying to return to Baekeland De? Burn the ashes, put them in the box, take them to the big city, if you have time, you can find his descendants. As for Snowman, he does not know whether he is the ancient sun god, or the original creator, or The two are the same, oh, this is the same for us, certainly not the corresponding church or altar, so you can only be buried next to Grosser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grossel...he should want to go back to 'Giant Wang Ting', but this is a city only in myths and legends, and reality can't be found. However, there are some giant relics in the north and south mainland, you can bury him in those places, let him really sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Giant Wang Ting"...Beckland De... Klein silently listened to it and thought about it for a few seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grossier, Snowman and Longzer's ashes gave me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks that it’s not too short, but it won’t be too long, Silver City should explore “Giant Wang Ting”, when it’s time to put Grosse And the Norman’s ashes were handed over to the little “sun”, let him drop the two ancient characters, and Beckland was the place where Klein wanted to return. It was the end of his trip and he was able to leave his hometown. Longzel, who has been in 165 years, took it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edvina followed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Golden Dream' often goes to Sunia I am responsible for the corpses of the island, Shatas and Mobate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, wait for you to be responsible for the cremation." Anderson turned his head and looked Daniz, half-smile and sighed, "You see, everyone has their own place to play, there is no need to feel inferior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought it was up Niz would not understand his comfort and glare at himself. Who knows that the famous big pirate just fainted a few minutes, and he silently bowed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, as a companion who has faced the 'King of the North' together, we can pick one, and inherit their behest." Anderson uses the chin The items that shimmer on the floor, "Oh, these extraordinary characteristics must have a small amount of their remnants, do not know what kind of impact, whether it is blended into a potion, or find a craftsman refining The items should have certain specificity. The former can be digested by the 'playing method'. The latter has no way. Ah, you don't seem to understand the 'playing method', then I didn't say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His last sentence was to Daniz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t feel obsessed with Anderson, looked at the four extraordinary features:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Give me the summers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the main material of "The Ocean Singer"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina thought for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I took Snowman." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This corresponds to "the priest of light", Klein already has a copy, so there is no choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson swept the remaining two extraordinary features and his eyes rested on the strange things in the palm of his hand:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" I said, this guy is very interesting, maybe you can make a magical item that can chat with me, so that everyone is no longer lonely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there is still no "the heart of the giant", Klein looked at Daniz and said indifferently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I? I didn't do anything, I didn't participate in the battle..." Daniz was very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein succinctly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You explored the road and took the risk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Klein, this is actually a kind of compensation, because Daniz mourns the name of the "fool" and knows the German Sparrow. The secret, so must be forced to become a "fool" believers, otherwise it will leave great hidden dangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is one of Danize’s voluntary risks, Klein still wants to make up for one or two. Of course, he hopes Daniz will regard this as The gift of "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is to change the extraordinary characteristics of Grosell into money, buy the corresponding formula and materials, or create a magical item of defense type, against Dani It is very useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Receive it." Edwina also looked at Daniz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...good." Daniz silently for a few seconds, focusing on the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the distribution was completed, Klein stepped forward and stooped to pick up the extraordinary characteristics left by Shatas, seeing the blue water in the transparent film gently Shaking, vaguely heard the beautiful song of the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just stood up and saw that Daniz had nodded and seemed to be responding to questions, but no one talked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s gaze swept through the face of Edwina’s expressionless face, skeptical that the “mystery tutor” was using a voice that no one else could hear. Communicate with Daniz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Daniz giving a definitive answer, Edwina reached out and folded the "Grossel Travels" on the table and handed it to Klein: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my gratitude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without me, you can also defeat the Frost Giant Dragon.” Klein didn’t reach out and looked at the booklet that was bound into the yellow-brown parchment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, we will die together, we have no way to stop the last madness of the 'King of the North', and, when you enter the book, you risk a lot. Edwina is like a teacher, seriously explaining the reason, "My only request is, if you have researched its origins and principles, tell me the answer."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was very curious about the secrets of Grosser's Travels, and he no longer quits, and reached out to take this magical book:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, because the importance of "Giant Wang Ting" is becoming more and more prominent, he still wants to buy it The next 5,000-pound black iron key belonging to the giant, but he did not immediately make this request, lest Edwina think that he was blackmailing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is ready to wait a few hours, or tomorrow, and then find the "Iceberg Lieutenant" to borrow the key, first go to the divination on the fog, confirm the value, Then pay for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Anderson and Daniz also picked up their own extraordinary characteristics, Edwina looked at the darkening sky, against Klein Road :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you going next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By Yam." Klein calmly Reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can ride the 'Golden Dream' past We have a lot of spare rooms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not see the dagger and agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free boat who doesn't like to sit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handle the cheekbones and clean up the captain's room. Edwina went to the door and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burst of surprise outside, and the atmosphere in the corridor soon became a feeling of boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, it’s okay." Edwina looked around in a circle, and the cold expression was unconsciously more smiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
