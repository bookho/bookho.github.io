			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the tan parchment, the Chinese with a slight twist and fangs wrote:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" On August 2nd, this pool of water is deeper than I thought. History is really a little girl dressed up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"August 5th, today's insight It is terrible to reach the strength of high-ranking strongmen. They have undergone qualitative changes in some aspects and become like gods. It is no wonder that they have been described with 'half-god and half-human'. Well, I think it is possible to call 'mythological creatures'. More appropriate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"August 6th, people feel strange, why the seven churches will have such a strange attitude towards the potion, in the middle and low In the sequence stage, they not only give the main materials for the promotion, but also generously share the formula and demonstrate the process of dispensing the pharmaceutical water. If there is a corresponding ceremony, it will inevitably be explained in detail, and in the high sequence, they only provide the finished potion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is completely illogical, relative to the main material Is it easy to collect and the production process is relatively simple in the low-to-sequence stage, should not be confidential formula, directly modulate the potion to the target? To the high sequence, because the main materials are difficult to obtain, it is not necessary to share the formula, let the promising members take the initiative to find "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is definitely hidden, I don't know the secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"8 On the 9th of the month, what happened in these two days made me feel that it was not very good. The industrial revolution that I personally opened, the steam and mechanical era that I personally created, will become a hotbed of evil spirits?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean? A hotbed of evil spirits? Klein frowned slightly, and the index finger gently tapped the edge of the ancient long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Footer" has encountered a problem? The things that can make him embarrassed must involve a very high level... Audrey looked at the leader who was covered in thick fog, and interpreted some of his current state from the other party's body language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is really thinking about Klein at a high level of questioning for a while, didn't get an answer, and began to think about the possibility of using divination to seek revelation:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, relying on such simple and simple two sentences, it is impossible to divinate the substance of the matter. I am not a prophet... Direct divination "a hotbed of evil spirits"? I feel that I am dying... The evil spirits may not be as horrible as the eternal sun, but the power may be even more bizarre. Maybe I will find me when I can't find it... and there is no way to divinate how dangerous it is, because once it involves the gods, divination has No danger is inherently dangerous...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember this question first, observe more and think...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The matter of the potion, the arrangement of the church is indeed quite a bit strange, I don’t know what secrets are hidden behind this, maybe waiting for the “Psychic”, no, it should be the “Dead Teacher” Dai Li becomes the Archbishop Or a senior deacon, entering the core level of the church, I can get some hints...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roussell is really a bit of a yearning for high-ranking strong Ah...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One by one thought flashed, Klein stopped tapping the edge of the ancient long table and looked at "justice", "downside down" and "Sun" Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can I have exchanged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Upside down" Alger immediately said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'fool 'Mr., 'Miss Justice', I got a new intelligence, 'The Lieutenant General Hurricane', Qierlings sneaked into Bakerland to complete a difficult task, he might stay there for a long time, and Making a horrific tragedy, I also know that this matter involves a very important item that can help Zilingers quickly become a high-ranking item."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Soon is a high-sequence strong? Is he not afraid of losing control?" Audrey grabbed the focus of the other party's description and put on the "audience" gesture, asking questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qilingers is the "winder" of Sequence 6, separated from Sequence 4 by a sequence of 5. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger had long expected such a problem and replied bluntly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, this is my speculation. The information I received is this: Qilingus believes that once he completes the commission and gets the item, he will soon be able to work with the 'King of the Five Seas'. The Principal also said that the 'four kings' in the pirates would become 'five kings' and the seven pirate generals would be reduced to six."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ordinary people It may not be clear, but as an extraordinary person, we should all know that the 'four kings' in the pirates are either directly high-ranking strongs or have a high sequence of combat power with the cooperation of extraordinary ships and magical items, Qilinger If you want to be recognized and equal to them, you must have a close level, so I guessed it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only know the "king of the five seas" Nast is the strongest of the sequence 4, and he doesn't know his potion name... Klein listened quietly and didn't make it easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairiker Berg, although he couldn’t understand the incident described by "downside down", he didn't know who it was, but he still listened. I am very focused and I feel that the world has presented a new door in front of my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pirate? Where do they live in the oceans claimed in books? That's very different from the environment around the Silver City... They don't seem to worry about the curse, they don't worry about the invasion of the dark things... It's really curious... Well, Mr. "The Fool" sighed, don't It is impolite to ask other people's secrets at will... Dairik thinks silently, and looks back and forth from "downside down" and "justice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your speculation is very reasonable, of course, it may also be a magical item that rivals the high-sequence strong." "Justice" Audrey smiles Respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Upside down” looked at the “fool” who was stunned in the thick fog, and took a moment to look at “justice” and emphasized:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The description I have just had two main points. One is that Zierlings will stay in Bakerland for a long time, and the other is that it involves a very important Very magical items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, "Mr. Fool", are you not excited? You have plenty of time for your best to go to Beckland... Alger Momo added a sentence, but he didn't dare to say it directly, he could only ask for a point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted man", you don't have to emphasize it repeatedly, I can understand what you want to express... But my strength does not support me to blend this Something, and I can't leave Tingen without permission... Klein leaned back on the back of the chair and thought quite helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t say anything, I can find two more powerful extraordinary people to help...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp One is Dai Li who has been promoted to Sequence 6, but I can't explain all the situation to her. At the very least, I received a line report, "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qilingus sneaked into Beckland, living in a certain In a certain street, what are you going to do? As a result, Dai Li is likely to directly mobilize the power of the night, making things very confusing and very troublesome... In the end, if you still can't find a helper, um, you can Try this to avoid the tragedy...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other one is Mr. Azke, but I can’t reveal to him the status of “fool”, please He did not have enough and justified reasons to blend into Qilingers...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thought flashed, Klein said slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the fool remains Without a statement, I still don't pay attention to the affairs of Qilingus. "After hanging people" Alger sighed, converging and losing, and began to exchange the results of this week's investigation with Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... In short, we have initially locked in the scope of the general activities of Qieringus, and will start to look further." Audrey first briefly explained the specific The situation, and then with a mentality that I am doing big things to do serious things, "We need more information, the focus is the hobbies and habits of Qilingus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;“倒吊人” Alger recalled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He likes to eat fish very much, especially the fish in the ocean, sliced ​​raw ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He loves to drink spirits, look down on champagne and red wine, etc..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
