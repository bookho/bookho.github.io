			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina is a pirate stepping out from the middle and lower levels. Although it is often irritable and irritable, the experience of doing things is absolutely rich and relatively reliable. Kind of people, carefully recalled and carefully described: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The well is deep in the sea, I must have enough buffer time to adjust to get there. Pressure and temperature, so it took a long time to arrive.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not easy to find itself, but the remaining steel buildings are indeed obvious, I am there to adapt The environment, they found them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have completely collapsed and decayed, and they can’t imagine what they were, but it can be seen that they have been scaled before, but they have shrunk now. A lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nina said here, chuckled twice, and glanced at a man present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real female pirates are really different... Klein immediately felt a sigh in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his view, regardless of "the star above" Jia Delia, or "Iceberg Lieutenant" Edwina, "Disease Lieutenant" Trey In fact, they are not pure female pirates, because they are all born with big forces or secret organizations. When the sequence is low, they are either not at sea, or follow big people, do relatively safe things, or be alone. The home is almost unaffected by the style and atmosphere of the middle and lower pirates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Nina laughs, Jia De Li Ya refers to the rust that is hard to say is a metal strip on the other hand:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is part of those steel buildings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Captain, you know, my history and mystery I don't know too much, I can only bring it back, let you study, you are an expert in this area." Nina smiled and handed the "metal strip" over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, she pointed to the remaining black clay road covered with honeycomb:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the place not far from the steel ruins, I found the well. It is really not big. If this can be described as 'giant', then I must have seen many cannons.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those drunk adventurers are more bragging than our pirates! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the dirt in the inner layer of the deep well. I can’t imagine how these traces were formed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nina's fingers slammed on the honeycomb spots of the black soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein originally thought that it was a trace of the intensive shooting of small items, which could be carefully observed, but it was suspected that it was left behind by the corrosion of something. ": Each spot is very shallow, and the edges spread slightly irregularly around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina will hand over the black clay to the "Star above" Jia Delia, while continuing to describe: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The well is really small, even if I find a child from Nassis, I can't get into it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's deep, I even I feel it has no bottom. In the environment there, its interior is black and faint, as if something is slowly summoning me, right, slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found a few stones nearby and threw them in, but there was no response. In short, it was full of water."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gidard Ria took the "metal strip" and black earth, carefully examining the next line through heavy glass lenses:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the wellhead is small and humans can't enter directly, then we don't have to start exploring now. It's very dangerous.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for me to figure out these two The hidden secrets of the items and whether the ancient well has enough value is worth our adventure, we will try to return here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Captain! "The wet Nina was blown by the cold wind and shuddered, and the pirates around her eyes were straight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Delia pushed the frame down. For Nina: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can drink a bottle of Sunia blood wine today, the other is not limited. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Long live the captain!" Nina cheered as she was happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underwater ancient wells that humans cannot enter... Klein, who did not explore desires, summed up Nina’s description in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he had a wonderful idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans could not enter the ancient underground well, Does not mean that non-humans can't! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of deep-sea fish bodies are not necessarily so large, with a small probability of passing through the wellhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as "Poseidon", when you are in charge of the scepter, there are enough ways to drive the marine life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, don’t worry, see what the Ms. Hideer can learn from these two items, and then decide whether to explore when returning, otherwise maybe There will be any danger of exaggeration... This kind of thing, the current information is not enough, there is no way to divination... There are many ideas, and Klein’s surface is not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "Star above" Jia De Li Ya looked at him quite strangely and then took a look back without leaving any traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did she suddenly look at me? She sees what I do? She can’t possibly know that I have a 'Poseidon Scepter' that can drive marine life, no, she I know, but she knows that Mr. Fool’s holds the divine righteousness left by the sea snake Cavi Tuva, not the “world”...unless she sees the 'world’ is the 'fool'...but it’s even less likely Even the 'inverted man' is still in the 'world' is the level of the leader, she did not even find this point...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea is to think about it from the 'star above'... She is the person who is chased by knowledge, and has followed the 'mysterious queen', loyal to the 'Moss accompaniment', has been in the sea for many years, and has seen and experienced many things. It is not surprising to know that the 'Poseidon' field has the extraordinary ability to drive marine life...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, after discovering that the ancient manholes in the seabed could not pass normally, she naturally I think of the scepter in the hand of Mr. Fool, and I plan to ask for it later. Help? See if I am observing whether the 'world' has the corresponding information, is there a similar idea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thinks a lot, with the help of The ability of the clown to force his expression to remain indifferent without any unusual reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Nina went to receive the Sunia blood wine, Klein pressed her hat and returned to the cabin entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the door, a picture suddenly appeared in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the upper floors of the cabin The room, the windows were closed, the curtains were covered, and the eyes with not clear eyes were hiding behind them, watching the crowd on the deck quietly, watching Galman Sparo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who? Klein didn't stop at the pace, his body was not stagnant, and he entered the cabin normally without distinction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three o'clock in the afternoon, the bright but not hot sun sprinkled on the A garden near the University of Ton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle Deyt, who is already a senior associate professor, wore a long tuxedo at the banquet, wearing a beautiful bow tie, waiting patiently Doorway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He received a letter yesterday evening, the messenger was the waiter of the Earl of the Noble Hall in East Chester, and the writer was the one. The daughter of the influential member of the Senate, Miss Audrey Hall, who is known as the most dazzling gem of Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This distinguished lady mentioned in the letter that she heard from the party that Mr. Michel Deuter is an outstanding collector as a field Fans, she very much hope to have a visit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michelle Deit has no reason to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, an elegant carriage with a family badge drove to the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two servants who had been told to open the outer door of the steel fence led the carriage around the garden and came to the front of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A female housekeeper first went down, then a guard and a maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
