			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina is a pirate stepping out from the middle and lower levels. Although it is often irritable and irritable, the experience of doing things is absolutely rich and relatively reliable. Kind of people, carefully recalled and carefully described: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The well is deep in the sea, I must have enough buffer time to adjust to get there. Pressure and temperature, so it took a long time to arrive.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not easy to find itself, but the remaining steel buildings are indeed obvious, I am there to adapt The environment, they found them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have completely collapsed and decayed, and they can’t imagine what they were, but it can be seen that they have been scaled before, but they have shrunk now. A lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nina said here, chuckled twice, and glanced at a man present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real female pirates are really different... Klein immediately felt a sigh in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his view, regardless of "the star above" Jia Delia, or "Iceberg Lieutenant" Edwina, "Disease Lieutenant" Trey In fact, they are not pure female pirates, because they are all born with big forces or secret organizations. When the sequence is low, they are either not at sea, or follow big people, do relatively safe things, or be alone. The home is almost unaffected by the style and atmosphere of the middle and lower pirates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Nina laughs, Jia De Li Ya refers to the rust that is hard to say is a metal strip on the other hand:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is part of those steel buildings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Captain, you know, my history and mystery I don't know too much, I can only bring it back, let you study, you are an expert in this area." Nina smiled and handed the "metal strip" over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, she pointed to the remaining black clay road covered with honeycomb:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the place not far from the steel ruins, I found the well. It is really not big. If this can be described as 'giant', then I must have seen many cannons.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those drunk adventurers are more bragging than our pirates! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the dirt in the inner layer of the deep well. I can’t imagine how these traces were formed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nina's fingers slammed on the honeycomb spots of the black soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein originally thought that it was a trace of the intensive shooting of small items, which could be carefully observed, but it was suspected that it was left behind by the corrosion of something. ": Each spot is very shallow, and the edges spread slightly irregularly around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina will hand over the black clay to the "Star above" Jia Delia, while continuing to describe: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The well is really small, even if I find a child from Nassis, I can't get into it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's deep, I even I feel it has no bottom. In the environment there, its interior is black and faint, as if something is slowly summoning me, right, slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found a few stones nearby and threw them in, but there was no response. In short, it was full of water."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gidard Ria took the "metal strip" and black earth, carefully examining the next line through heavy glass lenses:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the wellhead is small and humans can't enter directly, then we don't have to start exploring now. It's very dangerous.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for me to figure out these two The hidden secrets of the items and whether the ancient well has enough value is worth our adventure, we will try to return here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Captain! "The wet Nina was blown by the cold wind, and the pirates around her eyes were straight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can drink a bottle of Sunia blood wine today, and the rest is unlimited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Long live the captain!" Nina was happy to cheer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underwater ancient wells that humans cannot enter... Klein, who did not explore desires, summed up Nina’s description in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he had a wonderful idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans could not enter the ancient underground well, Does not mean that non-humans can't! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of deep-sea fish bodies are not necessarily so large, with a small probability of passing through the wellhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as "Poseidon", when you are in charge of the scepter, there are enough ways to drive the marine life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, don’t worry, see what the Ms. Hideer can learn from these two items, and then decide whether to explore when returning, otherwise maybe There will be any danger of exaggeration... This kind of thing, the current information is not enough, there is no way to divination... There are many ideas, and Klein’s surface is not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "Star above" Jia De Li Ya looked at him quite strangely and then took a look back without leaving any traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did she suddenly look at me? She sees what I do? She can’t possibly know that I have a 'Poseidon Scepter' that can drive marine life, no, she I know, but she knows that Mr. Fool’s holds the divine righteousness left by the sea snake Cavi Tuva, not the “world”...unless she sees the 'world’ is the 'fool'...but it’s even less likely Even the 'inverted man' is still in the 'world' is the level of the leader, she did not even find this point...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea is to think about it from the 'star above'... She is the person who is chased by knowledge, and has followed the 'mysterious queen', loyal to the 'Moss accompaniment', has been in the sea for many years, and has seen and experienced many things. It is not surprising to know that the 'Poseidon' field has the extraordinary ability to drive marine life...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, after discovering that the ancient manholes in the seabed could not pass normally, she naturally I think of the scepter in the hand of Mr. Fool, and I plan to ask for it later. Help? See if I am observing whether the 'world' has the corresponding information, is there a similar idea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thinks a lot, with the help of The ability of the clown to force his expression to remain indifferent without any unusual reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Nina went to receive the Sunia blood wine, Klein pressed her hat and returned to the cabin entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the door, a picture suddenly appeared in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the upper floors of the cabin The room, the windows were closed, the curtains were covered, and the eyes with not clear eyes were hiding behind them, watching the crowd on the deck quietly, watching Galman Sparo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who? Klein didn't stop at the pace, his body was not stagnant, and he entered the cabin normally without distinction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three o'clock in the afternoon, the bright but not hot sun sprinkled on the A garden near the University of Ton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayle Deyt, who is already a senior associate professor, wore a long tuxedo at the banquet, wearing a beautiful bow tie, waiting patiently Doorway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He received a letter yesterday evening, the messenger was the waiter of the Earl of the Noble Hall in East Chester, and the writer was the one. The daughter of the influential member of the Senate, Miss Audrey Hall, who is known as the most dazzling gem of Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This distinguished lady mentioned in the letter that she heard from the party that Mr. Michel Deuter is an outstanding collector as a field Fans, she very much hope to have a visit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michelle Deit has no reason to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, an elegant carriage with a family badge drove to the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A female housekeeper first went down, then a guard and a maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, a hand with a long white gauze stretched out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the maids, Audrey gracefully embarked on Michelle’s pre-paved carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle was a glimpse first, and immediately the eyes lit up, only the flowers in the side gardens lost color at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the first two steps, taking off the hat ceremony:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome, distinguished lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your visit is an honor for me and my family. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey took the cap on the top of the head and handed it to the maid, a polite sentence, then followed Michelle Deit through the living room and entered Located in the collection room on the first floor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being here, Michelle seems to have finally recovered the owner’s self-confidence, starting from the left edge and pointing at the collection :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a helmet that appeared in the White Rose War. After my long-term research, I can confirm that its owner is a member of the Sauron family. At that time, they were still royals. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden helmet is exquisitely designed with bird-like decorations on the top, and the visor is made up of pieces of metal scales.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My ancestor was his first title acquired in this war. "Audrey responded with great interest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She adjusted her mental state in advance and made herself feel like she was actually visiting.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The failure of the Twenty Years War has plagued the Kingdom for many years, but it has also precipitated a hero. Michelle flattered one sentence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Rose war occurred before the war of vows after the Twenty Years War, and Lun defeated Intis and changed again. Strong.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle continues to introduce his collection, Audrey listens very seriously, and asks questions from time to time to communicate with each other.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Michelle’s finger points to a note with a black cover:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It belongs to twenty years A knight on the island of Sunia during the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The knight’s name has disappeared into a long history. Only this note proves that he once existed and once stood on the island of Sunia until the last moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This note is not only a first-hand study of that history, but it also contains certain problems. The knight has a lot of grammar. Less common habits, this may be a clue to help us figure out his exact identity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey instinctively believed that this note was its goal, so it was a little closer, and it found a less obvious line on the black cover." Imprint, they together outline a rather abstract dragon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the tone and subtle expressions introduced by Associate Professor Michel, he wrote this The interest in notes is mainly focused on content, not on itself, not particularly cherished... I have great hopes of buying it... Audrey calmly makes judgments, leans over his head, smiles and looks at Michelle Deit :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the less common habits? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like a short sentence, a very short sentence..." Michelle tells the story.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey has always been a qualified listener, smiling at each other, listening very carefully, which made Michelle say more content.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening, she suddenly felt that the knight’s grammatical habits were somewhat familiar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is..." Audrey Eye眸 slightly turned, quickly remembered the source of familiarity.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
