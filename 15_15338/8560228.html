			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Future", Frank Lee rolled up his shirt sleeves and licked his pen, with a smile on his face:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My dear friend, German Sparrow, I want to tell you a good news. I have used the flesh and blood of 'Rose Bishop' to successfully cultivate a brand new mushroom, as long as there is fish, It can continue to breed, so that we don't have to worry about not eating mushrooms for too long, and it has a good taste with beef!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The only flaw is that there is no way to fish for fishing. Someone has to help, but I don't think this is a big problem. After all, Nina said that it will not pollute the ocean. Well, when she said it was right. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I sent you some dried mushrooms. Just give water and fish, they will become normal immediately, self-breeding, I hope you like me. The gift..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a bunch of smashing, Frank folded the letter paper, loaded the envelope, stuffed the three dried mushrooms, and then applied the glue. , complete the seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he took out the note paper given by Klein and carefully prepared the ceremony for summoning the messenger according to the above description,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not complicated for Frank. It didn’t take long for him to set up the altar and create a spiritual wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he solemnly placed a Lun gold coin in front of the candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighting the candle, after finishing the mantra, he stared at the flame, watching it swell and coming out of a four-headed Head lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank was shocked first, and immediately stared at Renee. Nikol’s four looks, bright red-eyed heads, whispering道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you do it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is it exactly the same? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you grow into the soil, can you grow more?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rennie The four heads of the four-handed eyes of the special Nicole Cole turned and looked at different places, and finally fell to the face of Frank Lee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, all the dirt in the various containers in the room flew out and piled up in front of Frank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank then floated up, his expression slammed in the air, and he fell into the pile of dirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His legs are constantly struggling outside, but they can't be pulled out for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenitt 缇 Nicole's four heads have two forwards, biting the envelope and the gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she disappeared completely, Frank Lee finally found the best point of strength, left the soil and fell on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's amazing..." Frank first sighed with a horror, then wiped the dirt on his face into his mouth and chewed it for a while, whispering Self-speaking, "Slightly bitter..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the captain’s interior was completed, and the "star above the star", Jia Delia, seemed to be aware of it. The dark purple eyes subconsciously looked at the location of Frank Lee's room, and faintly saw a hand-rough illusory doll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This doll has no head! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture flashed past, and Jia Delia’s eyes closed momentarily, and there was a kind of pain in the inside that was burned by the fire, and the two lines of tears were difficult to contain. It’s down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She frowned a little, and whispered affirmatively:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ancient evil ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the news of Gilman Sparo's haunt and the 'Crazy Captain' Connor Victor, the pirates should not appear in Bayam's public space for a long time, they are already on When the ship leaves Hong Kong, it is lurking in the hiding place, making it difficult to find.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, I have no need to stay here, the rebel army can pass The response of 'Poseidon' and Danis's transmission to control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, wait until the 'seaweed bar', get a fake identity certificate, buy a black ticket, go to the city of Conn in Desi Bay... This is not only the biggest port there, but also the hometown of David Raymond. When I released the red glove from 'squirming hunger', I promised him to go to this beautiful coastal city to have a look. , telling his daughter that hatred is over, um, by the way, I want to return the extraordinary characteristics of 'nightmare' to the church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, people are hypocritical, one side I intend to return the characteristics of the 'nightmare', while stealing the seal after planning the Chanis Gate from the Church of St. Jude..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein closed his eyes and restored his spirituality by sleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, he suddenly felt a hunch, naturally opened his eyes and quickly opened his mind. Then, he saw Renee. Nicole out of the void.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger is wearing a complex black dress similar to the past, one of which has a bite in her head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Who sent it? Daniz, Lieutenant General Iceberg, Frank, and Anderson Klein took the letter and nodded their minds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very polite to the mysterious messenger who has a strong my own strength, and does not want to kill himself one day.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." "Want..." "Immediately..." "Return to the letter..." Renee. Nicole Nicole's four heads lightly open their lips and spit out words.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein ripped open the seal, took out the stationery, opened it again, was shocked by the contents, almost forgot to answer the messenger, and Renee Nikol There is no impatience, waiting quietly beside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day Frank Lee will destroy the world, absolutely control him, can not give him a chance to advance! The guy is really, how much love crosses and loves to create strange plants? The amount... Silver City has always lacked food... Klein thoughts flashing, and there is a bold idea.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to let Frank transfer his research to a variety of foods suitable for Silver City!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, cows, fish, mushrooms, rose bishops, the sea and the world are safe!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is busy raising his head to the messenger Miss Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, reply immediately. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately got up from the easy chair, went to the table, turned out the pen and paper, and quickly wrote:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I have a problem. If you eat the mushroom you created, eat the cooked fish and drink a glass of water, can it continue to breed? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing the reminder, Klein introduced the topic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Can you create A type of wheat that grows without the need for sunlight, or a cow that produces milk and meat by eating monsters? This seems very interesting! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following this topic, Klein wrote a few paragraphs, and finally folded the letter paper and handed it to Renate. Nicole, very natural. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The postage is paid by Frank. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hope..." "He..." "Not yet..." "Dead..." The messenger’s four heads were finished in turn. A representative bite the stationery.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering for two seconds, Klein wrote a divination statement and determined that Frank Lee was still alive with a citrine pendant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He breathed a sigh of relief, packed up the dried mushrooms, licked his forehead and lay back in the easy chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, "Seaweed Bar". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein came to the top with Zhang Pu’s ordinary face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike before, the customers in the bar are mainly mixed with black hair and micro-volumes and local indigenous people, who belong to a gangster of Baiam, or The secret is for the rebel army, or both, and there are not many ordinary people. The common pirates from different countries have disappeared. Only a few adventurous guys drink spirits and discuss various rumors at sea. Klein glanced at Daniel, who was able to provide fake identification and black ticket . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t care what he wants, but he’s going back to the past:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second class ticket, a proof of identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deniel looked up at him and thought for a moment:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A total of 20 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to Connant, the second-class ticket is also the appearance of eighty-nine pounds... However, the black ticket itself is a lot more expensive, plus a fake identity certificate, 20 pounds is not too outrageous... Kleinmer counts the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When can I take it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will give it to you after three quarters of an hour." Denier answered very skillfully, "You can pay first." 5 pounds, get the ticket and proof of identity and pay the rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Klein no longer squatted, took out the wallet, and took it. 5 tickets for 1 pound of cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not worried about who will be targeted at the wallet, which may mean that he can save 20 pounds of spending, maybe there is still left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denil just recognized the authenticity of the banknotes, was about to give up the hand to do things, and suddenly found the bar to become extremely quiet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein also noticed that the subconscious mind looked at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people there, one wearing a dovetail dress, wearing a black trench coat, brown hair neatly combed, eyes are not big, but bright and fascinating, left behind A shallow beard gives both a gentleman's sense and a sloppy taste. The other is a hooded robes that are now quite rare in public. The face is shrunk in the shadows. Look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sloppy gentleman swept a circle and seemed very satisfied with the reaction of everyone. While flipping the silver coin in his fingers, he walked toward Denier. The man in the hooded robes followed behind him, taking out something from his pocket from time to time, stuffed it into his mouth, and squeaked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver coin flipped and the sloppy gentleman came to the front of Denil, and he laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Give me 10 tickets for tomorrow to Pritzport, they belong to three different ships."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Mr. Odell "Deniel is afraid to stand up and respond to each other." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t think of who was the diffuse gentleman who flipped the silver coin between the fingers, because the other party didn’t seem to have a bounty, and when he heard the name Odell, he Vaguely familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he recalled, he saw the hooded man take a brown candy from his pocket, throw it in the mouth, bite The sound is rumored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving a positive response, Odell did not stop, in a quiet atmosphere, went to the stairs and went to the second floor of the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
