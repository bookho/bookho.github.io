			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of colors emerged, the gas field came into view, Klein casually examined the status of Sir Deville. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The body is very healthy, there are almost no hidden problems...the mood is very bad, the bleakness is weak...the mental weakness?The sleep is not good? But the problem is There is no problem with the purple color of his head..." Klein silently said that Sir Devil’s line went further and further away from the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting his eyes, Klein squeezed his forehead and secretly sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s not easy...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t pay much attention to this matter and re-focused his sights on the journals in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading an article, Klein didn't find a clue that was too useful, just confirmed a few things:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, there is indeed an ancient kingdom in and around the main peak of the Hornaces; secondly, the history of this ancient country dates back at least 1,500 years ago; again, their architectural style is grand Mainly, leaving a variety of murals, as can be seen from the murals, they believe that after death, they will protect relatives in the dark; finally, in those ruins, symbols symbolizing the night can be seen everywhere, but It is obviously different from the emblem of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is a chance, no, even if there is a chance, I will not go there!" Klein grinned and decided to stay away from death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He packed up the journals, put them back in their original location, then put on their hats, lifted their canes, and left the Devils Library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divination Club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bogda looked at the beautiful lady in charge of reception:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to divination." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika politely laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a designated diviner? Or, look through our introduction and choose the one that works best for you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bogda pressed the right side of the abdomen and silently took a breath: < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to ask Mr. Klein Moretti to help me with my divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Retty is not here today.” Angelica replied without confirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bogda is silent, and has made two steps back and forth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is Mr. Moretti? Will it come over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nobody knows, he has his own business. According to my observation, he came the most on Monday afternoon." Angelica Said while thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Bogda turned dark and turned to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., you can also pick other diviners, such as the famous Mr. Heinz Vansente in Tingen." Angelica tried to save Business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bogdaton stayed in the footsteps and hesitated: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I only believe Mr. Moretti, um, can I wait here for a while? Maybe he will come over when he is busy with his own affairs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." An Jie Lika Wen Xiao smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bogda came to the sofa area, sat down, and sometimes rubbed his cane, and sometimes looked out the window, it looked quite anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, and when Bogda’s head is in chaos, I don’t know if I should wait or wait, he hears the beautiful lady’s surprise. Shouted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon, Mr. Moretti!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw familiar Angelica, I want to ask if you are here, do you not need a break, no holidays? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he immediately considered that he was a diviner. He should not ask a similar question, but instead he should use the god stick to say: Destiny is wonderful, Ms. Angelica, we met again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, is this going to be like? Klein’s thoughts turned sharply and he finally smiled and replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Good afternoon, Ms. Angelica.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A guest wants to find you divination." An Jielika pointed to Bogda Road, which was hurriedly standing up in the sofa area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is anyone actually designating me? Klein was pleasantly surprised to take off the half-high silk hat and squeezed his eyebrows twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, this gentleman..." He looked away and the words suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his "Lingshi", the color of the liver of the seeker is dull, almost black, and even the rest of the body is out of balance. The gas fields are thinning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein considered it with a serious expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This gentleman, you should Go to the doctor, not to divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bogda is there, immediately showing a pleasant look, muttering to himself:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's amazing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anny didn't lie to me..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly looked up and looked at Klein eagerly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moretti, I have actually seen a doctor, and there may be an operation next, but I am full of fear of surgery and hope that the outcome will be diminished."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surgery of this era is really very dangerous... Although there is the promotion of Russell the Great, there is still a lack of necessary technical points... Klein did not refuse, nodded slightly:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My divination price It’s 8 pence, is there a problem?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“8pence?” Bogda screamed, “Do you only charge 8 pence?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Anna’s description and Mr. Moretti’s performance, I am willing to give at least 1 pound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haven’t heard of small profits but quick turnover? Klein groaned for a few seconds, thinking for a few seconds, his mouth curled up and calmly answered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Getting the revelation of the gods, glimpsing the corner of fate, it is lucky enough Things, therefore, we must remain modest and refrain from greed, and only then can we continue to receive gifts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a true diviner." Bogda pressed his chest with his hand and took a ritual. His tone was very sincere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling this kind of praise and belief, Klein’s spirituality seems to be a lot easier, and the “Code of Conduct” just described also makes him seem to touch what . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Angelica, can the citrine room be used?" He turned to look at the beautiful lady next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika quietly sighed for Bogda, sweetly laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the divination room, Klein let Bogda lock the door, and he sat behind the table and pinched his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We use tarot cards to divination, how?" He asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spirit" is only suitable for measuring things related to itself, and painting astrolabe is a waste of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You make a decision." Bogda has no opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Klein asked him to shuffle, cut the cards, and put up an Intis card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking advantage of the speciality of the "Divination", Klein did not go through the cards and directly opened the one that symbolized the final result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The wheel of destiny in the opposite direction, things will move in the wrong direction." He glanced at him and said solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bogda’s face was pale in a moment, his lips twitched a few times:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is doing his best to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I change one Divination, trouble you to leave your ring, and write your birth date on this paper, then go outside and wait quietly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his mild and soothing voice, Bogda calmed down and wrote the information as he ordered, leaving a ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the other person goes out, Klein writes a line of words on the paper that records the information:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Bogda Jones's liver surgery results."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the ring and paper, leaned back against the back of the chair, and tried "Dream Divination" again . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of distorted distortion, he gradually recovered himself and saw that the gentleman’s face fell bleakly and saw him covered in white cloth, from shaking It was pushed out in the operating room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Klein didn’t meet strange things again, and there was no feeling of being watched again. He quickly woke up, his brow wrinkled, considering this How to tell Bogda results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surgery is very likely to lead to death... I can only learn the healing ritual magic that I learned today... but it will expose the extraordinary, and I must first apply to the captain... Well, I may not be able to treat such a serious illness... Klein thought hard and suddenly thought of one thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Glacis's lung disease was cured by a pharmacist. He said that the other's remedy is amazing... What is it called? Yes, Rosen Duckway, 18 Vlad Street, East End, 'Rossen's Folk Herb Shop'!" Because of the memory of the matter, Klein quickly remembered the details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tapped the edge of the table and made a quick decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the "spirit method" to quickly determine the quality of the idea, Klein opened the door, looked at Bogda hurriedly standing, and handed the ring , Wen Wenxiao smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw your hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really ?" Bogda surprised and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not answer, said by himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your hope is in the Eastern District, in Vlad Street, related to the word 'Rossen'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't find it, come back to me after 4pm on Monday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay." Bogda nodded in excitement, excitedly pulled out his wallet and counted a 5p and three 1p. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He completely followed the instructions of Klein and did not use the tip to erode the real divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s mouth was picked up slightly, smile and shouted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I hope you find it soon Hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bogda left, he was the same as last time, and he gave the money and gave him a tip, pretending to accept it. It is 1 Sule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East District, Vlad Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bogda walked from the street to the end of the street, walked three times, and went to the liver and fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he confirmed that there is only one thing related to "Rosen" on this street, that is, "Rossen's Folk Herbal Shop on the 18th." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
