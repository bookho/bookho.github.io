			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the wall, looking at the darkness across the corridor, Klein instinctively held his breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the captain doing? What happened to the captain? Is he drinking blood? Did he appear to be out of control? One by one, the idea is emerging, and his mind is in a mess, and there is no way to think effectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a dozen seconds, Klein bit his lower teeth and used the "clown" to control the body, silently moving to the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he deliberately stepped up and walked back, once again at the door of Mrs. Shelen’s bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sight line, Klein saw the captain standing there, wrapped in black cloth layered with the seal "3 - 0271", the expression was condensed, the ash was quiet, The face is clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he just saw seems to be just an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the eye was swept away, and Klein saw that Cohenri’s body had nothing new, and it was still the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He secretly took a breath and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, how can I confirm those Is the servant in a state of sleep? It seems that it is impossible to judge accurately by the vision alone. They will have different emotional reactions due to dreaming and present corresponding colors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dune Smith took the "Psychic's Mirror" and silenced for a few seconds, his voice hoarse and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I forgot, I committed tonight. Too many mistakes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to check, I will confirm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Raise one hand, hold the eyebrows, then close your eyes, let the invisible ripples of the circle and the circle sway to other rooms, swaying to the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether to fall asleep, clearly visible in front of the "nightmare." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the scene and slowly lowered his eyes and bit the inner side of his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, you just really want to open me...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you doing? Do you know what you are doing...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed his head and looked at the window, only to see the blushing month hanging high, it seems thousand It has not changed for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Klein took care of picking up tarot cards, revolvers, half-high silk hats and other items, and carefully examined Mrs. Cohen and Mrs. The body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stayed the same when they died, the skin became paler than the average person, with a little bruising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bit strange, they seem to be missing something...not a specific thing, but a feeling... Klein silently, only to see the broken window The cool breeze whipped up his hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Dunn opened his eyes and said low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleep, only a few are close to awakening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is fine, so it's good..." Klein looked at the captain and didn't know that he was answering. what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den is looking around in a circle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You take care of the items on the spot, then go The nearest police station came to find someone, um, by the way, I went back to Zoetlan Street and asked Frye to help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the captain deeply. The teeth are biting and biting: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of Dunn, He quickly handled the scene and left the main entrance to leave Mrs. Shelen’s house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the garden, outside, Klein couldn’t help but look back and saw the small building still quiet in the dark, no light . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned heavily and, based on the impression, quickly found the nearest police station - this is the common sense that every night must remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dangdang, Kline sounded the iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the police at night took the lantern, crossed the small courtyard, opened the door, and questioned it:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein can't squeeze any expression, calm a face, and take out his own The documents were opened and displayed in front of the policeman:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A serious murder was committed at 15 Orsna Street, you immediately called your companion Help in the past!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policeman brought up the lantern and looked at the documents carefully. Then he closed his legs and raised his hand to say:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sir!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handling this matter, Klein took the rental carriage back to Zouteland Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, he was sitting in the dark carriage, his thoughts were messy and divergent:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cohenley is dead...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that he was just engaged... his parents are still alive...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;What is the captain just doing...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is eager for blood...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Or, for another purpose...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His memory is still so bad, and there is no obvious improvement, which shows that he has no early signs of getting out of control! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he knows that "playing the law" has been around for a while, and whether the lack of improvement in memory also indicates that there are some problems in the dark...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! It must be that the captain is still groping for the "nightmare" how to play! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Yes, one of the important reasons for the death of Cohenri is the seal "3-0271", which the captain gave him...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What am I thinking! This was an inevitable choice at the time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... is also the captain’s proposed use of the seal "3-0271"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm down Calm down, don't think about it, don't wait, lest the situation worsen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and so on, send a letter to Ms. Dai Li to see if she knows what this situation means, even if she doesn’t know the specific answer, she can definitely understand the implications. The danger, tell the church in time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should kill the problem in the cradle and let the captain return to normal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the captain doesn’t necessarily have a problem, maybe it’s something I misunderstood, see what Ms. Dai Li said...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the rental carriage arrived at No. 36 Zouteland Street, Klein had already thought about the countermeasures and made a decision, no longer As confused as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He climbed the stairs and climbed heavily to the door of the Black Thorns Security Company, and took out the key to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Familiar familiar arrangements, familiar scenes, make his mood a lot more stable, just like every time there is something to look for the captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a breath, Klein came to the nightclub entertainment room and saw Frye reading books alone under the light of gas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked sideways at Klein, the cold and gloomy face showed obvious concern and tension:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain and Cohenri?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein whispered in a low voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Coenley died, died in the hands of Mrs. Shelen, we all made a mistake..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The captain is there to guard the scene and let you help in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before departure, Dunn Frye confessed to the specific situation and told him that if they could not return within two hours, they would immediately take a telegram to the church. Similarly, because they want to apply for the seal "3-0271", they must enter Chanis at night. The door, therefore, the Loyal of the rotating guard room is also clear about what they are going to perform. According to the internal regulations of the night, the opening of the Chanis Gate at night must be allowed by the captain. If the captain is there, the captain can only enter. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frye sighed, sighed low and drew a red moon on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put on his coat, put on his hat, walked toward the door, and when he passed by Klein, he whispered slowly:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to blame yourself, making mistakes is something you can never avoid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We always believe in teammates." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm..." Klein closed his eyes and his eyes seemed to be blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Frye first went to the ground, told Lorraine, then locked the door of the Black Thorns Security Company and rushed to the street in Olsna. Mrs. Shelen’s family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they moved back to Cohenri’s body and Mrs. Shelen’s corpse with half a head missing, the time passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun, wearing a black thin trench coat, stood at the door of the "mortem" and looked at it silently. For a long time, he turned his head to Klein: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You go home first, you have just experienced a fierce battle, you must be very tired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein did not deny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pouted and looked at the captain, quietly left the Black Thorns Security Company, and took the rental carriage back to Daffodil Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the last process, he easily entered his bedroom and really locked the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extracted from the ceremony, Klein created the spiritual wall that blocked the room, then sat at the desk, spread the paper, lifted the pen, and eagerly wrote: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Ms. Dai Li:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found that the captain has something wrong recently, he is on the mission It’s quietly...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing here, Klein suddenly stopped the pen, his head was blank, I don’t know what to do next, how to describe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He violently dropped the pen, grabbed the paper in front of him, smashed into a ball, and then slammed the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the ripples echoed, and Klein closed his eyes and reached for his face. For a long time, there was no movement, just like a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a full five minutes, he sighed, put down his right hand, ignited the waste paper just now, and watched it turn into ashes, falling into the trash Inside the bucket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organized the idea, Klein spread out new papers, rewriting and rewriting:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Dai Li, Dear:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We just ended a mission and lost a teammate in grief. The specific situation is this..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...At the time, I thought that my current level of vision could not confirm whether the servants were asleep, and that divination was very troublesome, so I went back and planned. Ask the captain, this time, through the reflection of the mirror, I saw the captain half aside the body of Cohenri, with dark red blood around his mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I don't know what happened, I don't know what the captain is in, I hope you can give me the answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
