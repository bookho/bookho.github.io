			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 am, Hilston District, an upscale hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein picked up a bottle of finely-packed white wine, and gave it to the opposite veteran:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mr. Asnia, thank you very much for coming over to interview me. This is a very small gift, please accept it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I The decision will be made at the latest tomorrow. At that time, you may come to visit you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is using a euphemistic attitude to indicate that the other party is unsuccessful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, he Actually quite satisfied with the old Mr. Asnia, the other party perfectly fits his imagination of the butler, rigorous, decent, professional, and comprehensible, and is good at dealing with various troubles.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the longest and oldest of the three family members, he actually took a full half an hour ahead of time and patiently waited outside the door, while Ribak and Walter were just A quarter of an hour in advance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not a "mirror", Arrods hints that there are some extra clues in the body, Klein feels that he will choose this Mr. Lao, anyway, his main purpose is to use the stewardship of the housekeeper to more easily and naturally mix into the upper class and reach the corresponding goal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bottle of white The wine is his consideration of the fact that some people will be disappointed today, wasting the carriage back and forth, and deliberately dining in Intis Bought, each bottle worth 2 pounds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is effective and full of Daun. Tang Taisi is a very generous, very graceful image of a mysterious rich man.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, he also believes that he should not be underestimated by a stewards of a noble family. In the past professional experience, such people must know a large number of high-ranking people and many Professional butlers and countless servants, covering the upper, middle and lower levels, can effectively influence a gentleman's style, which is a necessary reference for entering a higher level of social circle.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current era, the 55-year-old Asnia hair has become a lot of white, and the blue eyes have precipitated the wisdom brought by the years. He did not reject the gift of Dawn. Dontes. I took a look and looked at it with meticulous attention:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really like this white wine from Carlod, thank you for your generosity, praise you Demeanor. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cardard? Yes, the waiter introduced yesterday, this is a winery in the province of Intis Champagne, famous for producing high-end wines. In a few years, the wines are considered top-ranking. Hey, a housekeeper knows the knowledge of alcohol more than I do. Just now, Mr. Asnia said that the wine cellar of nobles and rich people is a housekeeper or a housekeeper. Directly responsible... Does this mean that I have a wine cellar after that, the 2 pound grade is the bottom type, the 126 pounds of the 1330 Olmer red wine is not the best... How much does a wine cellar cost... ...thinking, Klein felt that his chest was a bit boring, and he thought that it would not last long for the 2,888 pounds that eliminated the gold coins.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no "clown" At the stage of the experience, he will definitely have a state of ecstasy at this time, instead of smiling and opening his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your favorite is the greatest compliment to me, Asny Mr. Ya, please take care of Mr. Ribak in the coffee shop below. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asnia agreed without hesitation. In less than five minutes, Ribak knocked on the door and entered the room to stay in the living room.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gentleman has a neatly groomed pale gold hair with a little wrinkles on his lips, not too obvious, his skin color is healthy, temperament is masculine, at first glance it is the kind that can accompany the owner. Hunting even against the enemy's housekeeper.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After greeting each other, Klein smiled and asked the other person to sit down and talked straight: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forgive me for my confession, I don't understand too much why you become the steward of Baron Sindras, your father is the deputy steward of the Nigan family, your grandfather is the deacon of this family, you Many of the ancestors served the Duke and his relatives until they returned to the embrace of God, and you should have such a life path. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the influence of Russell the Great, the countries of the Northern Continent originally liked to express the habit of a nobleman with the title of the title and the title of the nobleman. The former will be used unless there is a special official occasion. Of course, there are also a small number of nobles whose surnames are directly derived from the name of the enclosure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ribuck smiled and replied standardly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Baron Sindras is a new aristocrat and a friend of the old duke, so I was sent In his home, he and his family were helped to adapt to the life of the nobility and to master the etiquette."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old duke in his mouth refers to the father of the current Duke of Nigan Pallas Nigan, who was assassinated last year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, why did you leave the baron later?" Klein asked as he pleased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebak said calmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the Baron Cindras relied on the title to be conservative Party, but he himself is one of the most famous bankers, investors, and business owners in the kingdom. He is one of the earliest multi-millionaires. He has strong sympathy for the New Party and is willing to provide some help. This makes him and Many conservative aristocrats have contradictions, including the Little Duke.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, in order to avoid the baron's embarrassment, I offered to leave, he actually saved me, he It is a very good employer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You believe in the storm the Lord'? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebak responded earnestly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the Lord gave us courage, Enthusiasm and responsibility. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein asked a few more questions about the housekeeping field and got a detailed answer. He smiled at Ribuck: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Trouble you to go downstairs to the cafe and ask Mr. Walter to come up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you talk to him, I will make a decision. You can wait ten minutes in the cafe."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Ribak didn't have any embarrassment, immediately got up and bowed, and left, the style was very military. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was sent out and closed the door, Klein sat down again, took the black tea and took a sip, silently saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you choose him, you should establish contact with the current Duke of Nigan, the Conservative Party, and the extra expansion may include some cases of previous assassinations..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, Walter arrived and knocked inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein first greeted each other with a few words, and then asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You and Kang What is the contradiction between the keeper of the Viscount Nad? You know, I have to figure this out, I can't bear the risk of offending a nobleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter The forehead is wide, the black hair is bright, the brown hair is serious, but it doesn't make people feel that they can't talk. He thought for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As an assistant to the housekeeper, At the beginning, I was responsible for the children of the Viscounts. In the process, because of some things, I got the appreciation of a big man, which was heavily weighted by the Viscount and was watched by the housekeeper.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Later, the big man died of an accident, the attitude of the Viscount to me changed, and Mr. Guan Jia is not very friendly, which makes me think there is no need to wait for a turn. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children responsible for the Viscount met a great man... Well, Talim was also in the process of teaching the son of Conord, and with Prince Desak knew, and the prince died a few months ago due to the smog of Beckland... This is in line with Walter's statement... It seems that this steward is the marginal victim of the original... he Still very cautious and professional, did not reveal the shortness of the employer, did not reveal the prince's things, and did not say the bad words of the Viscount butler... If you choose him, the extra expansion is worth looking forward to... Klein listened quietly, reminiscent of Some things.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to some professional topics, expressed his desire to enter the upper class, and after receiving a satisfactory answer, he took care of the clothes. Smile up and get up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Re-recognize, Dawn Don Tas, your employer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter is on the way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
