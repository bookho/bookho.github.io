			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the divine beams of light, the tree tumors and flesh and blood that have lost their external strength are disintegrating, like the snow that burns red iron balls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the indescribable voice, Cynthia’s face wrinkled and looked very painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She struggled to turn left and right, and looked up, her expression gradually became frightened and confused, and it seemed that she finally found her state wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General..." Her voice trembled, and she looked forward and feared and desperately, but she could only find a strange face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein could have used the flesh and spirits of Cynthia to feed the "squirming hunger", but at the moment it just sighed and said calmly: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not touch strange items or religions in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, Cynthia becomes now This appearance, whether it involves cults, or because of a dangerous item, has been linked to the existence of invisible, so it will respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cynthia vaguely understood something, only one head and a little flesh and blood, she suddenly shed tears:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes, is the mother tree of desire, is the celestial sect...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General, general, I don't want to die, don't want to die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me! Save me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desire mother tree...celestial sect... This is not within my occult knowledge... Klein’s expression has not changed, and she looks at Cynthia, who is crying for help, and opens her arms again, opening her mouth: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Death is not the end, you will be redeemed by the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a beautiful and pure light column, Cynthia’s beautiful face Completely freeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes are desperate, but there are still some hopes for the heaven after death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the "sun", her head and her body melted at a speed visible to the naked eye, disappeared, and finally purified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at this scene calmly, without a change in expression and movement for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything subsided, his mouth was slightly ticked, and he couldn’t help but laugh a little:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s a crazy and chaotic world...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous experience made him dare not “psychic” directly, and many of the strange things made him give up In the case of bringing Cynthia spirits to the "inquiry" above the fog, and facing the situation where the evil feelings cannot be solved and the corrosion is getting worse, he can only choose to let Cynthia get the purification in time. After all, this is a The world of true God, there may indeed be heaven after death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the resentment of "squirming hunger", Klein is not worried about it for a long time. After so long, this magical item sealed to a certain extent He is getting better and better, he doesn't have to give it food right away, he just restores the original condition. Once it is turned on, it only eats once every 24 hours, no matter how many times it is used, of course, it is not used. That day, there is definitely no need to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Klein still has plenty of time to find food for "squirming hunger" without hurting innocent people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not working, you can still throw it on the fog... Klein looked around and found that the members of the General Guard and the waiters in the house were all out of the magnified The influence of desire, coma in the past, including the maids who want to get praise and approval at the door, including the blonde secretary Ruer Ann. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, the root cause of the problem is solved, so that things can be completely ended...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The description of Admiral Amyrius, Luer Ann is at least the extraordinary of Sequence 6, suspected of 'corrupted Baron', and may even reach the sequence 5... He is so easily magnified by the desire to control, indicating the power of the help of Cynthia The nature is extremely high, but why am I just making a spring dream...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a magical item, I should be at the same level as Luer'an...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the part of the power that is interwoven with reality helps? Because of the restrictions on Ad Hoc's "temporary contract"? Or are there two factors? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, without them, as the main target of Cynthia, the desire in that aspect will definitely be magnified to the extreme, and this will not be just a slap. The dream of..." Klein habitually stretched his right hand and stroked his face, and changed back to the way of Amyrius Levitt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the rest of the people are not in danger for life, he carefully examined the room and the inspiration suddenly touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first few steps, Klein came to the disappearance of Cynthia, bent over and picked up a necklace from the pile of broken clothes on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The necklace is hung with a large knuckle pendant, which is black in shape and looks like a narrow rhinoceros horn. Its surface is extremely dull and covered with numerous cracks. In addition to some evil feelings, there is no spiritual brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the dangerous thing that caused Cynthia to change. Because it is connected to the unobservable existence, it has completed its mission and poured all the power into it. Cynthia's body?” Klein made a preliminary guess based on the situation of the sinker and previous experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it for a while, and then no other gains, so he took out the paper man, dealt with the traces of the scene, and lifted the restrictions of the spell, then went to the flower Shortly after swallowing a little trace of corrosion, the blond secretary, Ruer Ann, raised his knees and kicked the other side with his toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the character of Amyrius, you should not be able to do anything to shake the secretary... Oh, this guy’s arrogant look is really It’s annoying, I want to slap him a meal... Klein stops, and looks serious and calmly watching Rueran slowly wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Admiral..." Lueran was a little confused for a while, and seemed to be unclear whether it was in a dream or a reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a superior, there is no obligation to explain... Klein looks down on him, his voice low and says:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You awaken all the lightly injured here, part of the rest of the people, and some immediately investigate the celestial sects of Olawi, they worship a god of the desire tree, um... from around Cynthia Check it out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am waiting to report in the study. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he held the ruptured shrinking rhinoceros horn pendant, turned and walked out of the door of the master bedroom, into a quiet study that was unaffected. Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a military figure, although there is a certain helplessness in the face of the kingdom’s top, there must be some neglect of things, such as the just lifting of the Governor of Auston The telegraph order of the post, the new governor has arrived - this shows that the other party has departed for a long time in advance, and as the supreme commander of the Nazionale Navy, Amyrius Levitt did not receive any news at all, but Olawe Island, in the face of Secretary Ruer Ann, the local police system and members of the Naval Base, still has absolute authority and does not need to investigate on its own, and some can be arranged by staff.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The demigod only needs to guard against accidents, wait for news, don't be busy!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the study, Klein listens to the messy footsteps outside and the screams of horror Inquiring, vocal, and involuntarily floating in my mind There is a starry sky and a star that shines brightly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does this symbolize? Klein frowned and sat down on the back of the desk, immersed in the darkness of the curtains.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He soon had a certain association Because of the myths and legends of Silver City and Emlin White's description of the kinship, he confirmed that the "Moon" route has some authority to "reproduce", which is more consistent with Cynthia's intention and performance.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A starry sky...Mr. Gate' tells Russell the Great, the goddess corresponds to the tarot card is the 'star', not the 'moon', is this illusory The starry sky symbolizes Him? Well, the 'primitive moon' is suspected of being a priest of a god, angel or high demon, and the goddess has the name of 'the moon of the red moon'. Is it that he faked the 'primitive moon' and occupied the corresponding position and mastered it? The necessary authority? "Klein knows that such an idea is very embarrassing, but it is inevitable to doubt the goddess of the night.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
