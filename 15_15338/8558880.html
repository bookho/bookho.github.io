			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched the "ninth law" spell in the pocket, Klein adjusted the height and appearance details, and there was no more with Admiral Levitt. the difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the other door of the utility room and walked along the quiet corridor to the main building of the Governor's Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way, occasionally waiters and maids passed, but no one dared to look directly at Klein, just saw the Navy admiral, they retreated On both sides, bow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person of almost the same height wears this clothes, it is estimated that they can be directly mixed into the banquet hall... I have to say that sometimes, playing a big man is better than It’s easy to play ordinary people... Klein doesn’t squint, keeps that serious attitude, and goes unhurriedly to the aisle with black stone bricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the melodious melody seems to be unrecognizable, the elegant wall lamps on both sides burn the gas, lighting up the dark environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein approached a lounge and saw the door open, and a middle-aged man walked out as he waited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man's dark blue eyes, facial features and Amyrius are five or six points, but the forehead is high, the eye bags are slightly swollen, and the corners of the mouth are not drooping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the younger brother of Amyrius Levitt, Oston Levitt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gentleman once served in the Navy, relying on the merits of the colony in the South Continent, all the way to the ranks of the colonel, then disgusted with the military career, plus On the political balance, he turned to accept the appointment and became the governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the five or six years of Olavi, he promoted the Levit family’s large-scale acquisition of land and estates in the local area for the sake of the location and resources of the island. I myself have a lot of land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that it is entirely based on power. The Auston and Levitt families have paid enough money and even borrowed money from the bank. Like the Langdong coast, the land that originally belonged to the Fossacs was seized at a very low price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if he is not the Governor of Olavy, his brother is not the supreme commander of the Navy of the Central Sonia Sea, and the Levitt family is not so easy to convince the target to sell. Quality field or manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test came... Klein calmly moved closer and stopped in front of Auston Levitt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auston took a look around and said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The matter is considered What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened... Klein first stunned and immediately remembered an introduction in the material - "If Auston asks for a secret talk, or directly When asked about the answer to something, tell him to give him the answer when he leaves Olavi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really what Amirius expected, I only Need to pay attention to attitude and tone, um, and the unique words and pronunciation of the Lun nobles... Klein nodded lightly and said seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you leave Olavy, tell you the answer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auston did not doubt, laughing low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you seem to be waiting for?" Give you the power to decide. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that Admiral Amyrius must act alone? Klein’s heart is moving, and he is familiar with the tone of the high-ranking person:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put your guess. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, he turned from the static, stepped forward, and walked to the banquet hall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oston Levitt looked at his brother's back, his expression gradually getting colder, and he shook his head very small.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the banquet hall, Klein looked around Going to the long table where food is placed, and stopping from time to time to chill with the neighbors.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, he found that he did not need to understand The topic mentioned by the talker, with occasional nodding, will allow the conversation to proceed in a harmonious and pleasant atmosphere until the end.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the identity of the big man makes it easier to play in some aspects, but correspondingly, other things will be difficult... Klein has repeatedly “obstructed” and finally arrived at the long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picks up a plate at random and tells himself that Admiral Amyrius likes fish, cows and lobsters, hates chickens and geese, so he avoids roasting Chicken, Beckland-style roast goose and other foods, using steak, fried keel fish and cream cheese 焗 Olavi big lobster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is asbestos under the metalware, with red coal, or a container filled with hot water, the food still maintains enough temperature. When Klein got the first bite, he almost moved to the collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He strives to maintain the image of Admiral Amyrius, holding a plate and talking to a variety of people, such as port city councillors and naval agents, very seriously Listen to their words and put food in your mouth from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has noticed that a young man wearing a tuxedo suit is always behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other blonde is neatly combed, the hairline is slightly higher, has a pair of shallow blue eyes, looks handsome, and gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with the photo, Amyrius’s secretary, Rul'an... Klein took control of himself, didn't look at the other party, and rushed to fill his stomach before the end of the banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the Governor’s Office, Klein took the carriage protected by the General Guard and sat down to the side of the wine cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde secretary Rueran followed, and the leather boots stepped on the thick carpet and moved silently across from Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat down, but only one-third of his ass squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage began to drive, and Rueran took a stack of documents from the black briefcase:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Admiral, this is the 1349 summary account submitted by the Olavy Naval Base."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took over and flipped through a few pages to browse A bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? A roll of toilet paper costs 1 pound? The bathhouse at the naval base was renovated 20 times a year? Klein only made a rough calculation and found all kinds of ridiculous places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this accounting method too simple and rude? I can open a course for them, specifically teaching how to reimburse... Klein seriously thinks about what kind of attitude he should show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In his opinion, the biggest difficulty in disguising Amyrius is to marry Luer Ann. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that Governor Auston and Miss Cynthia have no secretary to be familiar with Admiral Amyrius, but Auston as a younger brother, even if they find something, get After the suggestion, it may also help the brother to conceal. Similarly, as a mistress, Cynthia attached to the general and has a tendency to help cover up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is not ruled out that Cynthia is a spy, or is exploited by a spy, but neither is the danger of Lueran, who is himself a supervisor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t reveal a little question... What is the attitude of Admiral Amyrius in the face of such a report, furious, or pretending to be furious? No, the people at the Olavy naval base will not be so bold. They will directly submit such a report with obvious problems. They will regard Admiral Amyrius as a blind man. They must have certain certainty and tacit understanding... because there is no similar information. In the case, Klein can only make judgments based on his own experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he can confirm that the report of the Olavy naval base is either unexpected by Admiral Amerius or he is not considered to be the focus. It is a simple schedule, and you can cope with the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is possible, you can cope with the usual posture of the superior, that is, not to express... Klein closes the file and hands it back to the blonde Secretary Luer Ann, said nothing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put it on my desk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The subtext of this sentence is "I will take a closer look", and the foreigner will have different meanings depending on the position of the interpreter:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Olavy Naval Base What happened was a sudden attack, which meant that the Admiral was somewhat dissatisfied and waiting for explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
