			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I didn’t go anywhere... trouble long legs, come over myself? Klein’s expression of a grin that was not in accordance with the setting of Gilman Sparo almost took a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only reason to stop him from doing this is that there will be no small movements that will cause "trouble" to discover his hiding place! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is no longer a younger night, he makes a quick decision, holds his breath, stands up slowly, moves to the gate of the iron fence with almost no sound Concealed and calmly looking at the place where the footsteps came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that since hiding is not necessarily useful, you need to identify the hazard-related situation in order to make the most appropriate choice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two rounds of miniature sun in the eyelids, Klein waited for a few tens of seconds, and heard that the footsteps became heavier and clearer, and Accompanied by the jingle movement of the iron door being pushed open and hitting the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he saw a tall figure appearing on the right side of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure is close to two meters five, wearing a black armor covering the whole body, the cold feeling is like a real, seems to be a giant knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is introverted, silent like the deep sea, the eyes are flashing with two deep red lights, and the hand is carrying a long and wide black straight sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed open the iron door of a cell, stepped forward, and turned around as if searching for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶... Is this looking for a prisoner? This will definitely find me... Klein hesitated, thinking that he should be close to the other party, leave the cell, find another way, or attack, simply solve the target, then continue to shrink here, waiting for the dream End. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just judge how much time there is for them to think about, Klein quickly solves the citrine pendant in the left wrist cuff, and starts with a voice that almost only he can hear. Divination:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The knight was very strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed seven times, gram Ryan blinked and saw the citrine pendant spinning in a clockwise direction, with a large amplitude and a fast speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the goal is a very dangerous existence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer hesitate, no time to hesitate, Klein uses the extraordinary ability of the "Clown" to control his muscles, without any additional movement to open the iron Fence gate. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he took the opportunity of the Black Knight into another cell, gently went to the hallway, and shrunk his body to the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rich darkness, he listened to the movement behind him while maintaining a secret and swift action, and soon he took a turn and arrived at the suspected exit. A pair of iron doors in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying to push and pull, Klein found that the iron door was not heavy, but I did not know who was locked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for two seconds, he took out the key in his cell and inserted it into the keyhole, twisting it without much hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slight click came out and the anti-lock on the open iron door was lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this work? Although it is a dream, but I can't just take the key is an important prop... I originally planned to draw paper into a soldier, insert it into the door seam, cut it continuously, cut it one by one... Klein is half doubtful. The bellows slowly pushed open the iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What disappoints him is that behind the iron gate is not an exit, but a hall with lots of sundries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the door and lock it again. Klein bypasses the messy items and looks for possible doors or roads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, he noticed that there was a black wooden door in the corner that was not too eye-catching, so he carefully moved closer and explored the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene inside naturally appears in his mind, it is a storage room, with a full-length mirror on the right side and a linen robes on the right side. Figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone? The escaped prisoner? Klein, who was forced to leave the comfort zone, decided to take the initiative with a limited amount of effort, so he slowly turned the handle and pushed the black wooden door open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to master what is going on in order to decide whether to escape or fight at a critical juncture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" The figure in the linen robes was hurriedly asked, and the tone was full of despair and pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An adventurer," Klein replied simply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has relied on night vision to see the appearance of the figure:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit The man with a weather-beaten face has a deep wrinkle on his forehead, corners of his eyes and mouth, but his hair is black and shiny, without a silver wire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His linen robes are simple and simple, his expression is distorted by pain, and his rare black eyes are difficult to conceal the strange and doubtful: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adventurer?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you come here? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein keeps a certain distance from the young man who is not young, standing at the door and looking at the other side:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before asking someone to introduce yourself is a necessary courtesy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a "faceless person", just by taking a short time to look at it, he has already grasped the characteristics of the other side - except for the contradiction between hair color and wrinkles There are still old scars on the cheeks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man stunned and looked at the hall with concern:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You'd better close the door, we can't be caught by the demon, otherwise..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muscles of his face twitched twice It seems to recall something bad.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil? Klein whispered, reaching back and closing the black wooden door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man sighed and smiled bitterly:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I was not polite enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Leo Mast, a monk of a religious organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Religious organizations? It seems that they are not believers of one of the seven gods." Klein found the problem from the other party's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s a monk who believes in one of the seven gods, it’s obvious that it’s straightforward to speak out, even the gods of the Sun Church and the bishops of the Storm Church are not here. A dangerous place to fight when you meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leomaster laughs and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I admire the original The Creator, He is the omnipotent Almighty, the root of all greatness, He is the beginning and the end, He is the God of the Gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...heard The other party worshipped the original creator, and Kline’s first reaction was the “Twilight Hermit Church”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are indeed some small sects of primitive worship in the North and South continents, and there are many people who believe in the original Creator... Klein deliberately asked道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the name of your religious organization?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you come? here? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leomaster hesitated to the next line:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The easternmost part of the Sea of ​​Sonia It is the place where my Lord sleeps. His holy mountain is hidden somewhere here. I led a pilgrimage team to try to witness the miracles and redeem myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps the inevitable test, we were caught by the demon, and died one by one...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Later, I seized the opportunity, escaped from the cell, hid here, and waited until the devil left. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought for a moment: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what the devil is? What characteristics does he have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"He?" Leo Master shook his head and said with a little confusion. "I don't know his specific name, but many pilgrims seem to know him and call him the 'Black Saint.' "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black sage? A half god? Is this Leo Master's dream, or the half-god dream? From the results of my divination, it should be the latter, otherwise it will not be too dangerous... Klein is going to ask which organization Leomarst belongs to and figure out the extraordinary ability of the "Black Saint". Yu Guang suddenly swept the full-length mirror opposite the monk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In occultism, the mirror is the channel that connects the hidden and unknown world, and it is easy to bring terrible accidents. Therefore, Klein in a dangerous dream carefully Going over, I intend to destroy this item directly with the ability of the "Light Priest." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, don't!" Leo Master seemed to notice Klein's plan and shouted in horror. "If there isn't it, I will, I Will die immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啊? Klein looked at the glasses again in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the environment here is extremely dark, there are two figures in the mirror, one is Leo Master, which is wrinkled with a lot of black hair, one is His face was thin, black-haired brown, and a spear-faced German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, when Klein had no movement, the mirrored German Sparrow slowly turned his head and revealed it to him. A gloomy smile! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirror suddenly swayed and one hand extended out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just blinked, and the same person, Michael, Sparrow, climbed out of the mirror and his face was stained with darkness. Obvious sensation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s scary...unfortunately, I don’t look like Gelman Sparo, so you didn’t scare me...if, in the mirror And I was drilling Zhou Mingrui, I am afraid I will wake up directly... Klein calmly looked at the other side, raised his left hand, and there was a layer of sunshine on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German Spalo, who was gloomy, smiled, and raised his left hand to make the gloves appear noble but evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This corresponds to the ability to "corrupt the Baron"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My copy? Klein thought about it and lifted his right hand with a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His palm is holding a milky white short stick that does not know where it came from, and the right head is inlaid with a blue-blue "gemstone". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poseidon Scepter"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the behavior in the dream must be logical to achieve the desired effect, Klein suspects that this illusory world cannot affect the fog that affects the mysterious space. Therefore, he has just tried to simplify the ritual process and tell himself that “Poseidon Scepter” is preserved in a place similar to the spiritual world. When do you want it and when you can take it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the experiment makes Klein happy, the dream world really can't distinguish the difference between the unique area of ​​the spiritual world and the fog, and the "Poseidon Scepter" does belong to Under his premise, this semi-god seal was "taken" out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really ok... or else you have to fight against the opposite side... Klein sighed in relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also believes that the mirror cannot replicate the parts associated with the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German's Gelman Sparo looked at the opposite side with a sluggish look, instinctively followed his hand, but the right palm was empty. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he saw countless silver lightnings rushing out, wrapping himself in layers, letting him consume the "paper man substitute" one by one but not The law jumps out of this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zizz, a huge thunderball illuminates the room that could not be avoided because of the narrowness, and immediately took the mirror of the German Sparrow Disappeared together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, Klein felt that he was inexplicably quiet at this moment, just like entering the time of the sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
