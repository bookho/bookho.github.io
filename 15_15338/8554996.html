			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When watching the lightning illuminate the dark sky, Dairik did not directly knock the doors of several acquaintances, but along the widest one. Avenue, all the way to the training ground on the edge of the Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After each exploration team returns, they will stay here for a period of time, which is convenient for them to communicate and report on the things and things encountered in the dark, and also to disguise isolation , to prevent some strange things attached to which member, and when the time goes to a certain degree, it will erupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the experience that Silver City has explored and summed up over the past two thousand years. It is not complicated, but it works quite well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just entering the training ground, Dairik. Berg, who had a "Hurricane Axe" behind his waist, stunned and saw the atmosphere bright, it seems only three The eldest-year-old Luo Weiya, also saw two acquaintances of the same age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Baiyin City is only that big, limited by the environment, the population has not been able to grow up, people in one age group say that there are fewer, not much Dairik did not dare to say that he knew all of them, but he also saw most of them, and some of them were several years of general education classmates plus training field companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this expedition, Dairik is most familiar with Dak Rickins, who has also worked with him as a patrol teammate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This boy named Dak is medium-sized, slightly fat, strong in strength, optimistic and cheerful, often with a close smile on his face, currently It is the sequence 8 "Corner" of the "Giant" route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the two sides are unable to make effective contact through a translucent but hard, steel-like wall. The team members who have to wait for the exploration team have all confirmed that there is no problem. The two sides can meet directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick, who became silent and lonely after his parents died, waved his hand and summoned Dak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Corner" was aware of it and looked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dak, how? Nothing is dangerous?" Dairik shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The material used in the black wall is not far from Silver City, called "黯 amber", hard as steel and has a certain transparency and good sound transmission. Sex, Dairik’s words have passed through without any hindrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dairik wants to come, Dak will definitely show a big smile, habitually waving his arms: "You see that I have not suffered any injuries, you should know We didn't encounter too dangerous things, it was a small problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing his voice, Dak took a few steps, near the wall, smiling Answer: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it has been very smooth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at him can't pick it up The smile, Dairik suddenly burst into the cold, just like sleeping in the abandoned tower top or the ruined city at night, surrounded by darkness and dark current savings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Craig Club, Dr. Klein and Allen reached the reward Consistent:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 pounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that the doctor’s money is a good earner... For me, this kind of commission, at most 10 Suller... I have this task Klein lamented in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers listening to the "collector" Fletti during the night squad, the income of famous doctors is very high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, unlike the poet’s poet Leonard Mitchell, as far as he knew, if he bought a house in the bustling area of ​​Beckland To make a shop, the fastest return option is to transform into a clinic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two parties agreed to visit Will's home after dinner, but it was only three o'clock in the afternoon, so the equestrian teacher Talim greeted them three People, made up a table, played an upgrade, the kind that Rosen the Great invented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I envisioned playing tennis, practicing shooting, flipping through books in the library, and having a healthy life... But why is it now? ... Klein thought to the interval of playing cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be frank, with his current "magic" rumors, it is entirely possible to let Allen, Mike, and Talim lose all the money they carry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am an honest person, I believe in my technique and luck... Klein picks up the shortbread while enjoying the red vest waiter Take a bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sincerely admired:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of playing cards, Klein noticed one thing, that is, the equestrian teacher Tallim is no longer in a daze, full of troubles as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to his friend who fell in love with someone who shouldn’t love? Klein drank the Marquis black tea and thought curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a detective, he knew that this matter should not be asked in front of others, so he slammed down and concentrated on playing cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At five o'clock, Mike Joseph had to repay the club, and the four-player game was stopped. Klein won 5 Sule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a good luck recently... Klein was amazed and amazed, and saw Dr. Allen leaving the table to go to the bathroom, controlling the voice, and laughing low: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talim, what happened to your friend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talim is Throw the cards in the middle of the table, sigh and sigh and laugh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added a lot of desire to exchange:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, it is not too serious, I thought too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a nutshell, a young gentleman with a prominent status falls in love with a civilian woman. You know, a man of similar status must marry a noble lady, huh. For him, even the richest daughter can't do it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way... Loss my brain to make up a lot of dog blood and bizarre stories, such as falling in love with men, falling in love with monsters, falling in love with ethical relationships Unacceptable objects... Klein was disappointed, and said funny: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I know, the upper class men don't mind raising a mistress outside. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Sherlock, you don't understand, love, understand?" love! The young gentleman only wanted to marry the civilian woman. Talim exclaimed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I don’t understand, I’m just a single dog... Klein opened his mouth and was speechless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talim said to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the future of the young gentleman, I used to I have thought about asking someone to find some magical ability, hidden, huh, huh, in short, I am a law-abiding person, I will only think about it in my head. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did things get solved later?" Klein asked with great interest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talim took a drink from the plateau coffee:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The solution is simpler than I thought. I directly found the lady and told her the dilemma. She is very sensible to say that she is willing to leave the gentleman and ask me for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to say that she is a considerate, kind, elegant, beautiful girl. If I don't consider my identity, maybe I will kneel in front of her and kiss." Her back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it seems that I can't help." Klein picked up the white glazed porcelain gold thread with black tea. cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a visitor to the earth, he is completely uninterested in the commission of a great fight against others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, when the gossip is another matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used dinner at the Craig Club and tasted a limited supply of Sue After the large lobster, Klein and Dr. Allen took the carriage of the latter and went to the Will Anthony home at 66 Doton Street, North District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the address that Dr. Allen remembered very early. He did not go back to the hospital to look at the corresponding medical records. According to Kline, most of the information about Will Ansett has been taken away by the night-timers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the former night, I know their process of doing things... Klein sighed with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorbell was ringing, and the two waited for a while and saw the door opened. The maid wearing a black and white dress asked in a puzzled way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr., who are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Allen or the usual cold look, Klein took the initiative Open channel:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are looking for Will Anthony, this is his attending physician, to make a return visit to confirm his health."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, I don't know him, I have been here for a few days... I am going to find my master, you wait." The maid replied with a blank face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two waited, Allen suddenly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just looked for For that reason, I almost believed it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the basic literacy of being a detective." Klein chuckled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a 50-year-old gentleman walked to the door and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Well. The Anthony family has moved, in..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reported a date. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan’s calculations frowned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can you be tired of moving?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He behaved as if he was returning home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein asked with a little doubt:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. how do you know so clearly? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, subsequent tenants will definitely move in after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old gentleman replied with a sigh of relief: "I have been asked before, I also specifically went to the landlord."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nights... Klein asked without any hope:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know Will. Where have you moved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." The old gentleman only spit out a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then they have anything left here?" Klein thought about it and continued to ask questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some." The old gentleman took a breath, "but all the people who gave it before!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a helpless thing to meet up with the peers... they always think of things you might think ahead of time... Klein couldn’t help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that there are no clues in the follow-up, Klein and Allen politely leave and leave the 66 Doton Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that your doubts will take a long time to unravel." Klein turned to Dr. Allen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen was silent for a few seconds and slowly vomited:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After what happened I am not so troubled. I am a doctor. It is enough to do my own thing. I should return to health, not to question the situation. What are the thoughts of others, why not be kind, not the problem that I should pay attention to. It’s okay to maintain the relationship between the doctor and the patient.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You can think so, it’s best.” Klein added a sentence from the heart, then Asked casually, "What was wrong with Will's left leg at the time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His left calf has a strange circle of tumor The body, just formed a ring, severely oppressed the blood vessels." Dr. Allen recalled, "But the child did not have any painful expression, but it seemed a little scared. We originally wanted to treat conservatively, but the situation deteriorated rapidly."
