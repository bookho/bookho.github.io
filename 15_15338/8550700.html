			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fallen creator...fallen..." "Pour the man" Alger chewed the words of the fool, as if he was lost in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in his heart, it is the relaxed, natural, and unconcerned attitude of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a kind of attitude and equality! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no previous ritual encounter, Alger may think that the fool is just bluffing, shocking himself and "justice" by raising himself, but now he is more I would rather believe that the fool is not as good as the real creator, but also close to that level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s dangerous... It’s an opportunity... Alger silently whispers, then brings a few smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool, your description is indeed more appropriate. According to our observations, the ordinary people who believe in the true Creator, no, the fallen creator, the proportion of out of control is much higher than the normal value, and the rest are mostly It’s a madman.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point, the insider’s internal information is also mentioned...and the so-called “madman” is not to say that it loses reason, but that it’s three Unusually distorted... Kline stayed in the same position, and did not pick up the words of "downside down". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still considering how to properly ask the Secret Society and the "Clown" potion, but has never been able to find a way to be identifiable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is still a fundamental difference between this and the online dating platform, otherwise I can build a small number to add it, specifically responsible for asking questions that I am not convenient to ask. ... Maybe one day, I learned magic like mirroring, you can try it, for example, let half of the members be my trumpet...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two chairs, 22 tarot cards, the corresponding perfect, but when I "think" to be a temple, I have not claimed to be a "fool", nor have I ever thought of establishing a Talo meeting. Well, this Is it a symbol of twenty-two serial pathways? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want a temple, so there is a temple, I want a "small", will there be a "small"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the fools shrouded in the thick fog, the words "justice" Audrey half sighed half and curiously said:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds terrible, oh, Mr. 'Down man', can you tell me more about the various mysterious organizations, the secret sects? I have difficulty in meeting them in daily life. These can only be understood by you, I will pay, do not know what you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good question! Miss "Justice", you have almost taken up the responsibility of my trumpet to some extent... In this way, "downside down people" will definitely mention the things of the secret society... You are the best! Klein heard the spirit, but did not let his emotions be revealed through expressions and movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger thought for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need a sum of money, £1,000, most Fortunately, the unfinished banknotes, or the newly-excavated gems, are calculated according to the monthly average price of the Beckland jewellery market."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1000 pounds? This is a huge amount of cash, and I can buy a house in the high-end neighborhood of Tingen City! Not everyone can take it out... Is the captain the annual salary? Hai Liye’s “death compensation” is only 300 pounds... Although “Justice” is a nobleman, it obviously does not inherit the family property, and can only get the corresponding annuity income... Well, it’s no wonder that “downside down” can be used. Gem to deduct... Klein is particularly sensitive to the amount of money, but fortunately his body is covered with fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a single lady or lady, £2,000 will allow her to live a decent life for the rest of her life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The stable annuity gain of £2,000 is around £100. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1000 pounds?" Audrey was distracted, then replied briskly and cheerfully. "No problem, is it still sent to the previous address?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the voice of Miss Justice, she thinks it is cheap? Klein didn't let his eyes shift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger was silent for more than twenty seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the Port of Warriors and the Sea's Bar in the White Rose District of Pritz, gave the boss Williams the name of the 'Captain'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Okay." Audrey leaned back and put on the "audience". "You can start the man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alger looked at the fool and thought about it for a moment, slowly speaking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We started from the Morse Abuse, which is the earliest secret organization, of course, Many people believe that the earliest hidden organizations should be the Goddess Church, the Mother Earth Church and the God of War Church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These people must be the main church of the storm , the eternal pilgrimage church or a member of the Church of Knowledge and Wisdom." Audrey retorted a sullen sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church of the Goddess is the earliest secret organization? For the first time, Klein heard a similar statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened in the Quaternary, or the Third Age? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The truth has long been buried in that ancient history The only thing that can be affirmed is that no one has ever said that the Church of the Lord of the Storm, the Church of the Eternal Sun, the Church of Knowledge and Wisdom was once a secret organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Okay, let us save time and return to the topic. The Morse accompaniment was first formed by several humans who watched the slate. They believed in an impersonal deity called the hidden sage." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is described as a god, but closer to a concept, a natural law, such as everything, hiding the sage is the embodiment of the spiritual number, such as knowledge Supremely, hiding the sage is the knowledge itself. Therefore, the early Moss acquaintance was a very respected organization, and the relationship with the major churches was very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The members of this organization used painstaking efforts to fight out of control, resolve the effects of the remnants of the potions, and strictly guard the secrets. Morality and precepts, thinking that people will continue to reincarnate after death..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sequence 9 they mastered is called 'the voyeur'... The term "sorcerer" is also From this organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey tastes the description of "downside down", keenly asks:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that the early Morse Penances were a very respected organization. Are they not now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Al Jie Wei is invisible and nodded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, they have fallen into evil organizations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Why? I think their philosophy is very good, very normal." Audrey expressed her doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also Klein’s doubt that the information he has access to does not record the reason for the fall of the Morse Penance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger looked at the fool who was so high-spirited, "Hmm" a voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The real reason, I don't know, this may have been completely obscured by the dust of history, but I know a terrible explanation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In that In the explanation, the main reason for the fall of the Morse Penances is that they believe in the gods, that is, the 'hidden sages', live!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He became Personalized evil spirits!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Live? How can this be alive?" Audrey asked in an unimaginable, incomprehensible tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quits the "audience" state without knowing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the same as the ghost story...and the “ghost” is still a god... Kline’s heart has also sparked a raging wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, no one knows the answer." Alger wanted to pretend to say "maybe Mr. Fool is clear", but he forcibly endured this impulse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he has tried it once on the edge of danger today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh chapter of the Book of the Storm has this sentence. Alger’s memory is still fresh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do not test God!”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey converges on emotions, no further questioning, indicating continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein maintains a seated position, keeps silence, and confirms the content of the "downside down" and the situation he knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, he found that there are four points that he needs to pay attention to:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sects were also known as the Witches family in the Quaternary. At that time, their members were scarce and maintained by blood, and they would kill their children’s fathers and abandon the boys, so all members were women. Of course, this It’s all Alger’s statement, whether it’s true or not, it’s temporarily impossible to verify.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Second, the spiritual group that believes in death, the rose school that likes bloody sacrifices, Originated in the southern continent, after the arrival of the colonial era, it was almost destroyed by the Church of the Seven Gods, but it spread to the northern continent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Three, psychological alchemy It is similar to the early Moss accompaniment, and believes in the existence of impersonality, and believes that the human spirit can be derived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The organization with the lowest frequency of activity in all hidden organizations, so it is least understood by others, every time they appear In what seems to just chase, what to look for "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; What chase? Looking for something? Klein Horan thought of the diary he had just read: Chalatu, the leader of the Secret Society, worked with Russell to get a relic of the Antigonus family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they appeared this time, the purpose is to retrieve the lost notes, the notes of the Antignus family... Klein’s eyes are slightly stunned, feeling like he’s The core elements of the Secret Service: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are chasing the legacy of the Antignus family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kleinke’s impulse to slap the table, his mind is full of thoughts:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, they Looking for traces of the remnants of the Antignus family? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to get the formula of the "Clown" potion from the Secret Service, do you need to start from this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another exchange of information, and Klein announced that this gathering ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow your will." Audrey and Alger both got up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cut off the contact and watch their figure break and disappear, Klein rubbed his eyebrows and tried to imagine a "small". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just fell, and saw a figure at the bottom of the bronze long table. The figure was wearing a black tuxedo, wearing a half-high silk hat, and his expression was sluggish. Even if there is a illusory fog, it is obvious that it is not right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No... Klein experimented many times and sighed, dispelling the idea of ​​creating a trumpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying to try something else, he continued to sit on the fog, sitting in the bronze long table, considering the words before Audrey, Curiously turned his attention to those illusory, deep red stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of silence, Klein began to respond to prayers, not to connect with the stars in a way that made connections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a piece of peace and death, he did not receive any information from the nearby ten deep red stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when you first establish a connection and pull people into the fog, can you "respond"? Klein nodded thoughtfully and was slightly disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not want to violate other people’s wishes and force the other person into this mysterious space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well... Klein began to prepare to leave, but inadvertently touched a nearby fantasy star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he suddenly felt that there was a weak and inconspicuous "prayer" in the deep red! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
