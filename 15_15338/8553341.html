Is this the true meaning of the path of God? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you take the corresponding potion, hold a good ceremony, and master the playing method to digest the extraordinary characteristics, ordinary people can become gods step by step? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really awkward...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will it be the last, the main material of the potion Is the divinity, blood and body of the "eternal sun"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last page of the diary information is too large, shocked Klein Almost impossible to think, almost have extra body movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-two ways of God correspond to twenty-two sequences 0...sequence 0, "the sun", sounds very powerful...maybe There is also a sequence of 0, "Death"? I don’t know what the name of the sequence 0 corresponding to the goddess and the master of the storm is... According to Russell’s description, this is partly the same as the main card of the tarot card, but some of them are different, and he made the The card is subject to the name of the potion... This is no longer a potion...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great regrets that he has not chosen "Divination", "Apprentice", " The thief" route is because their corresponding sequence 0 has not yet been generated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the sudden personalization of the symbolic god "hidden sage"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Russell’s final plan for? Giving people a sense of being universal, it seems that they can only rely on that mysterious and ancient organization...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original witch" is the sequence 0 of the witch route? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gradually recovered his thoughts and restrained the winds and waves in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that he can’t be immersed in this matter, he must return to normal as soon as possible, otherwise members such as “justice” and “downside down” will find problems and feel weird. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Footer" looks at that page diary for too long! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really want to get a "Big Card" made by Russell the Great, and see what is in addition to the potion formula, the corresponding ceremony, what else ... Klein suppressed the emotions of horror and doubt, and let Russell's diary disappear into the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked on the edge of the bronze long table and looked to the side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Miss, you did a good job and solved Beckerland in less than a week.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the agreement, what kind of reward would you like to get?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baker Lang is dead? So fast? "After hanging people" Alger has been away from the island in recent days, and has not received the corresponding information. He was quite surprised at the moment, which made the "justice" Audrey, who was secretly observing, comfortable for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Even if Alger is in the capital of the Rhodes Islands, the "generous city" of Baiam, may not be able to know in time, because the cable telegram can deliver limited news It is not particularly urgent and particularly important. It will always take a few days to shoot. In some cases, the colonists of the Rothde Islands will even have to know the "latest" status of the Northland in a month or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convergence of all kinds of ideas, "downside down people" looking at the "fool" in the thick fog, respectfully said in humility:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I only contacted the people and failed to help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the commission, Not helping, don't care.” Klein chuckled and turned his eyes to Miss Justice again, waiting for her to say what she wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May the goddess bless, the request of Miss Justice is not too tricky, it is best to use knowledge to pay back... I know from Russell’s diary A lot of things that are not allowed... Klein silently prayed to the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he is very clear that there is fog and isolation, and the goddess of the night must not hear his prayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey turned his eyes and thought for a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be a person to be honest, not greedy, Audrey, you must stick to your own principles! She sketched a smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it should be that I still owe you, no, owe you the rewards of the deceased."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The Hurricane Lieutenant' has a total of 30,000 gold pounds, and I should give it to you 15,000 pounds, of which 10,000 pounds was spent on assassination of Becker, I I still need to pay an extra 5,000 pounds. However, because of Baker's business, my recent financial situation is not very good. I need to wait a few months for this reward. Mr. Fool, can you?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Audrey sighed quietly, feeling that a small stone pressed in his heart was finally gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although discussing money in the face of Mr. Fool, calculating rewards is not a suitable behavior, but I can't hide the gains of His awkward... Audrey is silent Sighed a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the large plantation worth more than 8,000 pounds, because of the gratitude from the Duke of Nigan for her gratitude, it is a private thank-you, not a reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,000 pounds? Can I still take 5,000 pounds? The total reward of Zilingus is 30,000 pounds! Klein heard a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he was caught in a fierce psychological struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to common sense, I should give my remuneration to Mr. Azick, but I have been unable to contact him for a long time... It’s a wasteful act... It’s better to use this money, try to improve yourself, and then help to offset... Klein made a decision after three seconds, and gently sighed at Miss Justice:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the answer of Mr. Fool, Audrey’s elegant sitting posture has not changed. My heart was completely relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Klein, leaning against the back of the chair, no longer speaks, and secretly manipulates the trumpet with a condescending attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"World" coughs one channel:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I talk now?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Justice" Audrey looked at Mr. Fool, and he did not say that he did not say that he was slightly swearing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, she read the information again and made a judgment on the new member "World". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason that Ambassador Becker’s assassination was caused by the commission I accepted was that he did not show any surprises or surprises... he did not know this. The importance of a thing, do not understand the weight of an ambassador, or very calm, good at hiding their emotions and physical movements... his mouth and his words can not match, it should also be through the "fool" "Mr.'s translation, which made me unable to get his original message, and it is difficult to know which language he used every day... One thought flashed in Audrey's mind, accompanied by the hoarse voice of "World": <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to get the true rhizome of the foggy tree, at least 60 ml of the corresponding juice, and the medullary crystal of the Elven Spring, all the spinal cord of the evil-skinned panther Liquid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who can you provide, or have a corresponding clue?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You What do I want to exchange for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Well extraordinary material will require pharmacists to join his delegation, to avoid being Tarot Society members guess the main recipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the "justice" and "downside" reactions, the "sun" that has been silent has been opened:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know where there are foggy people, but I can also help you get the materials, but I have to wait for me to complete the promotion, have enough strength, and join the appropriate patrol team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been accumulating merits and rewards recently, working hard to get the main material from the private trading market to the "Prayer" from the Silver City official, and the gap is still relatively large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a city with a lot of monsters and a sinister environment... Klein sighs and asks the “world”:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What do you want to get?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik replied without hesitation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One suits me , a weapon that can improve my combat ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not propose the material corresponding to "Prayer" because Silver City has it, through its own efforts obtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While hearing such a request, Klein instantly thought of the rune steel sword that appeared in the extraordinary party organized by the "eye of wisdom". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sharp enough and has the effect of exorcism and purification. It can also be used for three years, worth 500 pounds, perfectly matching the description of the "sun". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How not to say earlier...has been bought away... Klein silently watched several members, and the "world" clicked on it: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will find the weapon that meets your requirements as soon as possible. Is this transaction witnessed by Mr. Fool?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slightly decapitated to show consent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "Justice" Audrey looked at the "sun" and reminded him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "In addition to the sap of the misty tree, the material requested by Mr. World is the extraordinary of sequence 7, and the approximate value is between 500 and 700 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;She thinks that the "sun" is pure, and he is worried that he will be deceived by the deep "world" with a weapon of low value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mr. Fool is fair and advocates an exchange of equivalents, if both parties agree, he is not good to stop. After all, some items are of low value but some people The type that is urgently needed, the premium is normal... Audrey thinks secretly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The recipe for Sequence 7 is around £800." "Inverted Man" Alger added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has an instinctive rejection of new members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein translated very hard, because he didn’t know what the currency unit of the pound corresponds to in Silver City, only the recipe of the sequence 9 analogy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." "The Sun" Dairik nodded slightly, then whispered a sentence, "...thank you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "world" maintains a gloomy style and does not express opinions on the matter just now. He turned to "justice" and "downside down" and waited for their answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey thought for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Psychologist''s potion formula The corresponding extraordinary material, um... this is the sequence of the 'audience' route."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can collect information first, don't rush to buy, wait for me With the clues of the evil-skinned black panther and the meditation of the Elven Fountain, the amount... If you are willing to exchange for the Golden Pound, you can buy it at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Although I have no money lately, I really have to rush to use it, but I can still raise a lot of it... Audrey comforts herself in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted Man" Alger Shen Shendao:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Sailor Route' Sequence 6' The Windy's potion recipe, which is more expensive than the extra materials you need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can find it, you can think about the extra What is the compensation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't guarantee that I will be able to collect the materials for you, even if one of them, you don't need to spend anything in advance." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咦, “The man who hangs down” and the church of the Lord of the Storm should have a very close relationship... he can get the “winder” normally. Formula? This is the fact that he wants to hide his own quick digestion of the "voyager" potion? Klein heard a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
