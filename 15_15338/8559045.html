			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the celestial sect is called Flett Ken, a man in his thirties, with a brown face on his thin face and a wicked neck. Different cyan tattoos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was brought to Klein by Lueran, the whole person was very languid, as if he had been severely tortured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Admiral, he was in the process of being arrested, using sensibility for strength, and the spirit is nearing collapse..." Blonde Secretary Rueran, regardless of Amyrius Whether the general can see the specific details, the original originally reported the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly... Klein was worried that Follett Ken would become a "madman", resist the mental oppression, refuse to answer his own questions, then he would Have to risk being suspected, step back and try to "psychic." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking coldly at the front of Follett Ken, Klein’s left hand was quietly stained with a golden color by the cover of the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crawling Hunger" switched to the "interrogator" soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "interrogator" is the sequence 7 of the "arbitrator" approach of Admiral Amyrius! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of Klein’s eyes, two lightning-like lights were immediately looming, completely overlapping with the reflected figure of Flett. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strong piercing" is ready to go! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Klein did not use this extraordinary ability directly, because it only has the level of sequence 7, once it is displayed in the face of Rueran, it will be immediately The secretary saw the identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the spiritual level of "spiritual piercing", Klein sat there, as if the real Admiral Amirus was quiet. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know Cynthia?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He speaks, he raises his right hand and makes his palm The black pendant with the narrowed rhinoceros horn is slid down and swayed in the air:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does it do?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wilting Follett. Ken trembled and felt that his spirit seemed to be being held by a sharp dagger and would be pierced at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but lower his head and stuttered and replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cynthia, Miss Cynthia wants to be with the Admiral, I want to have a child with extraordinary ability, introduced by her parents, introduced to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a 'breeding necklace' made with the breath of the gods, as long as you take it's powder and wear it for a long time, you can let the admiral You can't resist..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened silently, and half of the words of Follett Ken were skeptical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The part he believes is the purpose of Cynthia, this beautiful lady may be out of her own thoughts, perhaps urged by others, really want to and Amyrius There will be a child in the squad, which can be seen from the things she is obsessed with after her mutation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the aristocrats of the Kingdom of Lun do not like or even reject illegitimate children, this is also a case, a child who has inherited many of his father’s extraordinary characteristics and was born smoothly. It will also receive enough attention - the ancient families who know a lot of secrets are more valued in this regard, including the Levitt family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Admiral Amyrius is a serious and old-fashioned person with deep feelings, even if he is an illegitimate child, he will definitely love and value it... This may be Cynthia I really hope that there is a real reason for a child... Klein secretly sighed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His doubts about Flett Ken’s answer focused on the true role of the “breeding necklace” and whether the celestial sect deliberately misled this matter. Cynthia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of the oppression of "spiritual piercing", Klein silently looked at the eyes of Follett Ken, until the other side unbearably regained his head . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the role of this necklace?" Klein shook his ruptured pendant in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a gentle tone and seems to know all the secrets. Now the question is just to get the final confirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unspeakable pressure hits, and the spirit is close to collapse. Follett Ken can no longer bear it, plops and falls to the ground, almost madly shouting道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It, it can also pollute you!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as Cynthia takes it The powder that has come down, and sincerely mourning the name of the 'desire mother tree', can make the male who has a relationship with her and the child's success be polluted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take it, you can become a believer in the 'Desire Mother Tree'! Be His Heir!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out to be the case... Klein understood the truth of the matter and there was no doubt about the progress of the change tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the celestial sect is to use the "breeding necklace" of Cynthia's state of ordinary goods to pollute Admiral Amyrius and let the military giant of the Lun Kingdom Become a "sex tree" of the devotees, take care of the development of their sects, and even provide shelter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to the success of this approach is that it is sufficiently concealed and normal enough that it is not directly related to words such as power, attack, and horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, Cynthia, who was rejected by me three times, is difficult to get rid of because of the pollution power of the 'proliferation necklace' powder in the body, gradually surpassing the upper limit, and eventually with the 'desire mother tree' Hooking, there seems to be a sudden change...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, her mutant monster can’t really pose enough threat to the real Admiral Amyrius. Even I can use the 'ninth law' spell to solve it more easily, because this is not the result that the celestial sect wants to achieve. They only hope to conceal the pollution of Admiral Amyrius, not with the demigod. Conflict confrontation..." Klein silently glanced at the blond secretary Ruer Ann.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lurnan also roughly figured out the whole thing, immediately lowered his head and said: < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Admiral, this is our fault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We only monitor Miss Cynthia and the servants here, and did not extend to their families and their relatives and friends.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing to accept any punishment for this, even if you send me to a military court. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will the real response be? Klein once again incorporates the role of Amyrius to experience the pain, helplessness, sadness and anger he has suffered recently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept his correct posture and said with a serious expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This thing, I will talk about it later. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hidden meaning of this sentence is "see your next performance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lul'an For a second, I didn’t seem to believe that the punishment given by the Admiral was so slight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed his eyes halfway and said with a low voice:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My father, the old Earl of Levitt, who has passed away, once taught me a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said, forgive the mistakes you made for the first time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lurnan, you And those members of the Guard, thanks to his kindness. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lul'an eyes flashed, silently taking a breath, not so calm, quite sincerely said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Your mind makes me admire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will be the only object of my loyalty outside of principles, gods and kings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Your inner arrogance is very exaggerated... Klein does not believe so much, seemingly said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a second half before Sentence, 'Severely punish their second mistake.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luergan nodded, not surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein re-opened his eyes to Follett Ken, who fell to the ground, and asked his face unchanged:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is instructing you to do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he wants to come, Follett Ken’s answer should be our own plan, in contact When she went to Cynthia to understand her needs and knew who her husband was, the celestial sect had the idea of ​​polluting Admiral Amyrius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follet looks nervously left and right, timidly opening:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes, it is the 'Desire Mother Tree', He, He is instructing us to do this in my dreams. I am the only one who originally wanted to lend the 'Proliferation Necklace' to Cynthia, Miss Cynthia, and did not intend to let her take the powder." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Desire Mother Tree" means? This is equal to a certain degree of god... Klein frowned slightly. <br /><br />#################################################################################################### But it doesn't attract the direct attention of a evil spirit... But I am not a god of evil, I can't understand their thoughts, maybe there are more plans after polluting Amyrius... Well, I don't want to bless The possibility of Wright Ken lying, and so on, confirms... Klein thought about it and asked seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did you dream that day?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fallet squeezes a smile full of fear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, is February 4th On the Friday night of last week, I remember, I remember very clearly, I just liberated the spirituality for a lady."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;February 4...Klein Chewing on this date, I didn't think there was anything special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence for two seconds, he turned to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your relationship with the Rose School? ?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the relationship between 'Desire Mother Tree' and 'Bounded God'? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not worried that Admiral Amyrius actually knows about this, and the blond secretary Rueran also has some understanding, because this can be understood as a confirmation. Ask a question.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follet. Ken reveals the enthusiasm of endurance:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, we It is a branch of the Rose School, and my mentor is Zathwin, the saint of the Rose School. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Bounded God' is an embodiment of the 'Desire Mother Tree'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' Desire Mother Tree is the real, unique, god that transcends the Seven Gods and the 'real Creator'! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Admiral, you are the candidate of His singer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bragging who won't ... Is it possible to understand that the "desire mother tree" is the vest of the "bound god"? According to the evil spirit of the suspected "red angel" Medici in the underground ruins, the "prisoner" route and the "demon" route are interchangeable. Therefore, the rose school's "bound god" can magnify various kinds of creatures. The desires are normal, and they also have a distinction between “temperance” and “indulgence” factions... This is consistent with the situation at the scene... Klein thought about it, sideways to Ruhrian: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to ask about the bad things that Follett Ken has done to see if the other person can act as "squirming hunger" food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Admiral." Lueran did not ask why, hurried out of the study and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a slamming resounding, the entire study suddenly became quiet, as if it was isolated from the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary ability of the "corrupted baron"? What is the meaning of the action of distorting the "closed door" to close the study? Very caring... Klein thought for a few seconds, recalling a previous association, and suddenly asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
