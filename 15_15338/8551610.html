			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the nightingale is accompanied by insects, echoing on the road leading to the town from the abandoned castle, Azke looks ahead, silently a few seconds :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although not completely sure, there are already certain ideas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Maybe, maybe I am a person who has lived for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Azke, in fact, you can really consider whether you are still "people" In this category... Klein replied in his heart, but did not dare to say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wilderness, this night is quiet, always makes people weak...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I should have paid a certain price to get a long life, from the end of the Quaternary to the present, like a ghost wandering around the mainland..." Azick’s voice is low, as if he is suppressing Inner feelings, "I don't remember the past, I forgot those who swear to remember..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thoughtfully dials with a cane Weedy road ahead:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Azick, I have a guess about your situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What conjecture?" Azk looked at the peers sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think your forgetting is a cycle, maybe you will die every few decades, emptying the previous memory, then at a certain time After that, wake up from the darkness of sleep and start a new life. Only in this way can you explain your different dreams. It is what you have encountered in different life.” Klein described his speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick’s footsteps slowed down and seemed to be pulled by the darkness. He looked at the front with a faint look, for a while: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is consistent with some of the memories I was awakened by the stimulus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the stimulus, I woke up some memory? Klein moved in his heart and blurted out: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Azick, maybe you don't need to leave Tingen to pursue the lost past, you will slowly recall it. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Azke was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your memory has not been completely lost, stimulated today The part that wakes up is proof."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, do you remember that you woke up at Beckland and found yourself forgetting the past?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azko Zheng’s keynote: “This is a nightmare that has been bothering me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein I ordered a black cane with silver, which explained: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before today, I don’t think there is anything wrong with this thing, but combined with what you just did. The description and my own guess, it seems a bit strange, when you wake up from your dreams, but with new identification and enough money, and not to scare the way others play... it’s all like scheduling The same, let you quickly integrate into society."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is it arranged?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;& Nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only one answer, you are in the past!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past, you recovered your memory and knew that you are about to usher in a new life, so arrange it. Everything after that, try to avoid being suspected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azk stopped and looked at the sparse dim light in the distant town, Once in a long silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the ‘parents I’ve been looking for is the past me...” He sighed and admitted that Klein’s reasoning was persuasive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, you don't have to do anything, just wait patiently, you will slowly recover your memory." Klein gave a conclusion and comforted the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azke unconsciously waved his cane, and then the whole person seemed to be transformed into a statue carved into marble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, he replied profoundly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, maybe the old life entered At the end, I will completely recover my memory. I don't want to wait so long, I want to have plenty of time to figure out and get rid of this fate, so I must actively look for the past, stimulate myself a little, complete your speculation ahead of time. The awakening, and waiting will only let me repeat the previous cycle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is indeed the most anticipated choice." Klein did not persuade the other party, In turn, "Mr. Azick, besides helping each other, finding out the criminals who make my fate uncoordinated and take your child's skull, can I ask you to do a favor, insignificant?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick sighs first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you need me to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein organized the language: "I hope that you will be in the town around Tingen next week, or next week. It’s best to arrive in a carriage for more than two hours. In a town within five hours, create some magical events that don’t hurt people’s spiritual events. Well, I see that you just traced the criminals according to blood connections. Very good at certain things in the field of the dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Azk agreed without hesitation, never asked why the other side was like that. do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he also defaulted to Klein's guess about his abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, this matter is very important to me. Well, when you choose the goal of a spiritual event, you can only choose the believers of the Goddess of the Night, and, Don't leave a clue." Klein groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only then will the event be transferred to the Tingen City Nights Squad, so that he can join the mission team and propose to use the seal "3 - 0782 "Only in this way, he can steal the seal when he turns the guard, that is, the blood power in the "variant sun sacred emblem" to create the "yangyan spell"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most powerful item he can currently get. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——In the case where the behind-the-scenes black hand living in the red chimney house has not left Tingen, Klein must do his best under the premise of continuous investigation. Every effort is getting stronger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, according to the knowledge I have gained, I just steal a little bit of power and will not cause "3 - 0782" damage, at best let its purification effect be maintained. The number of years is reduced... I am here for the peace and stability of the city of Tingen! Klein defended himself in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azk doesn't care about the other's purpose, still nods:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will advance Tell you the name of the town and the approximate time so that you can be prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein sighed and felt Ramad The town is not white: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, although it only reveals the most outer veil of Mr. Azko’s mystery, there are more unknowns and no Solution, but at least he gained his friendship and found a reliable enough ally in dealing with the behind-the-scenes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 11:30 in the evening, Klein was tired and sleepy and hungry Back to No. 2, Narcissus Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Azke didn't even ask me to have a dinner... Hey, he is in a state of mood to eat..." Klein silently While pulling out the key, the door was opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house is not as dim as he expected, and an elegant gas lamp quietly blooms, making the living room warm and bright, letting the lonely sit on the sofa The position of Benson was covered with a layer of bright "outerwear". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing the door open, Benson, who was holding a book, was about to speak, and suddenly yawned and had to reach out and cover his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed the door and smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Azick faculty went to the small town of Ramd, where there is a historic abandoned castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
