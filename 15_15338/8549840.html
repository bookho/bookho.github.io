			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tingen City North District, 13 Hows Street, the divination club on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein once again saw the beautiful lady in charge of reception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She still has long brown hair and looks mature and elegant. It is difficult to judge her specific age only from the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Glacis is not here today, do you want to change a diviner?" said the beautiful lady with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Klein, who had just taken off the silk hat, was surprised:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you remember me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all five days ago! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merry Brown is grinning:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the first to find Glacis The guest of divination is also the only one so far, and it is hard for me to not be impressed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it easy to eat cheap? ? Klein spoke himself and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When was Mr. Glacis last time coming to the club?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Brown hair glanced at him as if she was thinking like this:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be honest, we can’t grasp the rules of the members. They have a free will and all sorts of things. Oh, I remember that after that day, after giving you divination, Mr. Glacis should have never been to the club again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish him good luck, may the goddess protect him... Klein prayed, no more, and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I This time I am not coming to divination. I want to join the club."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? This is our pleasure." Ms. Brown hair showed surprise at the right time. Look, "For the first time to become a member, please pay an annual fee of 5 pounds, followed by 1 pound per year. In the detailed situation, I don't need to re-introduction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;Kline took out a new 5 pound note from the inside pocket and watched Henry Augustus's head stay away from himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully checking the anti-counterfeit watermark, Ms. Brown took the banknotes seriously, took out a form and handed it to Klein:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You fill out the details and I will send you the receipt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have an invoice? Looking up is the Black Thorns Security Company... Klein is amused by his own thoughts, picking up the pen on the table, and filling in the blue and black ink, filling in the information such as name, age, street and company name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he deliberately vacated the date of birth, for a "divination", this is the number of spirits related to his own mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the receipts and register the membership. Ms. Brown has extended her right hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Welcome to join the Tingen City Divination Club, I am Angelica Barrehart, your hardworking service staff, this is your member's sleeve, with our unique inscription, can prove your membership. "Hello, Ms. Angelica." Klein gently gripped the other's palm and took the dark gold cuff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found the unique inscription above using the root of a word in the Hermes language, the word is the "Fortuneteller." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika took back her left hand and thought for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if you are good at What divination, or what divination method do you want to learn at the club? We will consider asking the corresponding well-known diviners to teach, and will also introduce you to members who are similar and good at communicating with you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every divination, I know a little, don't need to think about me." Klein replied slightly, and asked, "I can now divination for people." Am I not a rookie who just started learning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to play the role of "divination" rather than learning the methods of divination that ordinary people can access. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika keeps a polite smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can always The club is free to help people to divination, but before confirming your level, we will not help you when the customer asks, what is the divination charge you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Two pennies." Klein intends to win at a price when there is no fame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will draw a quarter of a penny based on one-eighth of the total price..." An Jielika first said the rules Once again, Klein's information was written into the "Fortuneteller" catalogue for customers to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When done all this, she smiles at the conference room at the end of the corridor:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sea Mr. Nass Vansente is explaining the astronomical divination, you can quietly find a place to listen, you can also raise your hand to ask questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. Klein went to the conference room with interest and wanted to hear what Heinz Vansente and Old Neil had said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Angelica catches up and presses down the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Morey Mr. Ti, do you need coffee or tea? We offer Xibo Black Tea, Nanwei Coffee and Dixi Coffee for free.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who has recently read the newspaper, knows these Both coffee and black tea are at the lower-middle level, but they also understand that they are definitely better than the inferior goods at home, so they thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coffee, three spoonfuls of sugar, no milk.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most famous of South Wales in the Kingdom of Lun is beer and red wine, many big people like it, and Coffee is relatively unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, wait for you to come in." Angelica stuck her finger to the meeting room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walked slowly to the half-covered door and heard the explanation with a strong Ahowa accent:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Astronomical divination is also a fairly complicated one in all divination..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only for ordinary people... ... Klein silently helped the other side to fill up and saw that the five or six long tables in the conference room were semicircular, surrounded by a middle-aged man wearing a black classical robe, Henas Vansente. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gentleman has obvious dark circles, brown hair thick and hard, and they stand steadily on one root, just like playing a hedgehog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, he has no obvious features to explain the astronomical divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Klein coming in, Heiners Vansout nodded slightly, did not interrupt the course, only slightly slowed down the speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein put his hand in his pocket, a cane, and sat down with a marginal position, leaning back comfortably, and still enjoying the bright sunshine in the afternoon. Looking around, I saw six members, four men and two women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are focused on taking notes, some whispering something, and others returning to Klein with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the cane, Klein pressed the half-height silk hat and bent his fingers to tap twice in the eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes cast on Heinus, saw the other side's gas field, saw the different colors, brightness and thickness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dark red, a little emotionally anxious...the other parts are very healthy, there is a problem there, I don't know what it is..." Klein is taking a leisurely class. , silently talking to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he punched his right hand and held his mouth, lest the laughter leak out, because he suddenly felt like an undocumented old Chinese doctor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is quite satisfied with this ability, although he can only judge the general situation and cannot distinguish the specific details, but it is enough to get a lot of useful information. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking around again, he tapped his eyebrows again, as if thinking about the words of Heiners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astronomical divination is a kind of astrology, but ordinary people can also try to interpret, such as the most basic "born astrolabe", according to the inquirer At the time of birth, the positions of the sun, the moon, the blue star, and the red star are respectively in the position of the sky, and their symbolic symbols are marked on the correct place on the chart, and the corresponding conditions of various constellations are attached, and finally the other side is interpreted. fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requires the diviner to understand the state of the planet and the constellation, which is quite complicated. Of course, some people publish books for people to inquire, and others Direct simplification, only use the constellation to do the most vague interpretation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened quietly, without interjection, without asking questions, from time to time to rub the citrine pendant in the cuffs, from time to time to pick up a South of the Angelica card Will coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Henas shouted: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may need to try Drawing your own chart, I have any questions to come to me, I am in the white crystal room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing him leave, a white shirt, black vest The young man smiled and got up and walked to Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, I am Edward Steve."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Klein Moretti." Klein got up and returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The chart is too complicated. Every time I hear it, I can't help but want to start a dream." Edward Steve said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is because Mr. Vincent always bears I can't help but teach us all the knowledge he has, just like giving us a table of Intis dinner at once, which is too bad for digestion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is me, I can finish a table of Intis dinner, they always use a big plate to put a little food." Edward smiled and sat down, curiously asked, "You are a new member. I have never seen you in these two years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just joined the club today." Klein calmly replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you good at? I am best at Tarot and poker divination." Edward asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand a little, and I only know a little." Klein used his previous description of himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not modest, because in the field of divination, there are indeed too many mysterious knowledge that has not been mastered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as other members wanted to come and exchange astronomical divination, Angelica entered the conference room:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Steve, someone is looking for your divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Edward Steve smiled and got up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks like you are a good fortuneteller." Klein looked at the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it’s just because my price is the most appropriate." Edward laughed softly. "Ordinary people come to divination, and definitely not directly pick the most expensive ones. And unless his head is kicked, he will certainly not be assured of the cheapest, and the price is the easiest to get in the center."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am The head you said was kicked by... I watched the other person leave, and Klein suddenly shook his head and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a problem with their price positioning...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up, took a cane, walked out of the conference room, and found An Jielika again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to change the divination price, um, 8 pence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika looked at him deeply:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will meet your requirements, but will also tell customers that you have just joined our club."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
