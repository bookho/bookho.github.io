			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acid Lemon Street No. 48, outside the "Azure Wind" hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "flame" Danitz, wearing a thick jacket and wide-leg pants, returned around the road and stuck it in the corner. He hadn’t moved a step for a long time, hesitating to take the opportunity to escape. No longer facing the horrible madman of Gilman Sparo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different from the encounter with Banxi, this time he hid the roof far away, can bring the entire battle area into the eye, so, in the auxiliary While Man Sparrow was fighting against the "Bloody Thorns" Huntley, he finally saw the battle process of the crazy adventurer and grasped the extraordinary ability and specificity of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paper man substitute, flame flash, mental impact, the sacred light of the "sun" field, the air bullets that sway the fingers, completely disguised as another person's ability And changing the shape several times and swallowing Scoel's magical gloves, the number is beyond my imagination, and several are still not compatible, this is not a simple sequence plus one or two magical items can explain... and The hunger from the depths of the soul also illustrates some of the problems... "The hurricane lieutenant" glove, "squirming hunger"! The captain deliberately reminded us that the glove can graze the souls of many extraordinary people and use their abilities... Daniz’s heart has flowed through the content of the previous thinking and the final judgment:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German Spalo is the current owner of "squirming hunger"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not appear to be so terrible because the other party relied on powerful magical items, and he was despised, but he became more and more awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how much of the magical items can be played depending on their level. If there is no certain strength and rich super-field battles, Experience, even if you have "squirming hunger", there is no way to solve the "steel" McVettiga calm Scoel in ten seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is his captain, "Iceberg Lieutenant" Edwina Edwards learned from secret sources that "Hurricane Lieutenant" did not die in the storm church On the hand, but on the way to escape, was quickly killed by a strong man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How strong is the "Hurricane Lieutenant" at the peak of Qilings, Daniz does not lack understanding, understand a strong who can easily solve him In which position, it is equal to the king who stands at the top of all pirates, and is also the most powerful and horrible of them, "King of the Five Seas" and "Mysterious Queen"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are factors of raids, but also up to some evaluations, not much worse than the "immortal king", stronger than "Hell Admiral" and "Blood The above will "..." creepy hunger now belongs to Galman Sparo, indicating that either he is killing the strong man of Qilingus, or he is standing behind a four-level figure. No matter what the possibility, it is more terrible than I expected. Daniz is physically tight and really doesn't want to face the adventurer with crazy blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... He vomited and felt that he was hesitating here for too long, and he must make a decision as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German Sparo will be divination, and he is quite confident in this ability, my "shadow cloak" is in his hand, escape not only It's hard to succeed, and it will irritate him... "Shadow Cloak" is a rare magical item... Daniz bites his teeth, turns out from the corner, enters the hotel door, and goes all the way to the luxury suite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully waited for a few seconds, observed the movement, and Daniz took out the key and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a darkness in the house, the gas wall lamp was not ignited, and the bright sunshine in the morning was shining through the window and sprinkled on the door facing the door. .Sparo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurer has changed back to the original dress, black coat with dark trousers, half-high silk hat in his hand, and raised his right foot , resting on the left thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned back slightly, his face was dark and fuzzy because of his back to the window, only the dark brown eyes, very clear, indifferently and calmly watching the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz unconsciously lowered his head and laughed at two channels:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told me that I had circled the offices of several newspapers and wrote the words of 'Flame' to kill 'Steel' McVetti, 'Bloody Thorns' Huntley and Skool, and threw them in.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, in this news, I have a strong helper, he is mysterious, unknown, is a top adventurer, is a seasoned and experienced bounty hunter. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gently daggers and reveals a polite smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dani I breathed a sigh of relief, looked around and looked at the "flying carpet" of the peacock blue background. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stunned for a few seconds and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Steel' and Huntley What about the head?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein calmly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not taken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't take it?" Deniz stunned. "What about our bounty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp As long as there are "steel" and "blood-colored thorns" in his head, he can get a corresponding reward through some people with relevant backgrounds, although this will lose 15 to 30 percent of the money, but as a A pirate can't get it by himself. It can only be done this way. The military and the church use the reward to encourage the pirates to kill each other. It doesn't mean they will let go of the gift from the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did Daniz didn’t expect was that he was mad at the money and he was not eager to take away "Steel" and "Blood" The head of the thorns is equal to giving up the reward automatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not answer him and pointed to the "flying carpet" on the ground:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You It is a collaborator, you have two choices.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One is 3,000 pounds of cash, and the second is this 'flying carpet'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give you 5 seconds to consider, timeout is considered abandon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3000 pounds in cash , or "flying carpet"? This flying carpet seems to have only two functions of suspension and flight, and the speed is not too fast, the use is not too big... wrong, at sea, for the extraordinary people outside the "sailer" approach, such items are very precious, at least not I was worried about what to do after the ship sank... Daniz was a bit hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he heard the German Sparrow number:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"3,2 ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! Daniz was shocked and hurriedly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flying carpet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein I nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that the other person is very reputable, Daniz finally Relaxed, half-satisfied and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come you didn't count 5 and 4?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say good is 5 seconds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein replied unchanged:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a count."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my heart...Danizi took a deep breath and showed a distorted smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slowly stood up, his wrist fluttered, threw the top hat in his palm, let it hang on the shelf, and went to the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wave Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alje, who entered the name of the morning prayer, met the bishop of the parish, Jogori, and told the original story of the last night. The only thing that was modified was that Change the blood anesthesia gas into a silent spell of the night church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jogoli appreciates nod:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For faith, dare to go deep into enemy caves and endure life threats This kind of behavior is worthy of praise, you are the real storm waiter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last night, we arrested five extraordinary people and killed two on the spot. McVeigh, Huntley and Scull are also killed. The heads of these three pirates will no longer appear, or they will be in our hands. The government's bounty will be attributed to us. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
