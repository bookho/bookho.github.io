			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Foolish?” The extraordinary people who attended Mr. A’s meeting either chewed the word or whispered with their companions to discuss whether they had met someone with similar beliefs. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did such a cult appear?" Someone whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Mr. A asked the waiter next to raise a blackboard with a few lines of words written in Lunwen:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fool who does not belong to this era;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mysterious ruler above the fog;<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king of yellow and black in charge of good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of reviewing the blackboard, Mr. A used hoarseness to make people quite Comfortable voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t read the above in Hermes, Giant, Elvish, Dragon, and Ancient Hermes are even worse. You can't even use them to write the corresponding descriptions, otherwise there will be terrible things happening with great probability.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me find those who believe in 'fool', of course, they also May follow the 'mysterious master over the fog', 'the king of yellow and black who is in charge of good luck', as soon as I get a little clue, I will tell me immediately that the reward I will give is beyond your imagination! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This description...sounds like a terrible existence, a similar name I have only seen in the seven gods' books! "A member of the party was amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companions shook their heads:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many Objects believed by cults will have similar descriptions. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What a cult? "The other party members heard their discussion and stunned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be, in general, the spiritual creatures we summon, maybe Such a three-segment description, but one of them must be 'who cares about who's or who's like 'who belongs to who, who's what's not going to be this form! A party member who is proficient in occultism gives a theoretical basis.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While they are communicating enthusiastically, Fols is almost stupid there.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn’t this the name of Mr. Fool? Although it is described in Lunwen, I can’t be sure of it! How can Mr. A think about it? The Fool's believer? This is the intention of the Aurora meeting? Fols's mind is a mess.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that Mr. A is a member of the Aurora, because of the previous In the assassination of Ambassador Bessley, a "terrorist organization" announced a high-profile responsibility.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short mistake, Fols looked down on himself and worried about being People find themselves to be members of the Tarot Society, in some sense the "fool" leader.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just follow the ancient Hermes on that piece of paper After reading the name of Mr. Fool, he was dragged into the fog. No one knew this thing at all, and he was not afraid to investigate... The paper that wrote the name of Mr. Fool was sourced, and it was hidden in the books we borrowed from the Viscount of Glylint... Foll thoughts flashed.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupids who are not in this era... Isn't this the description I saw on that piece of paper? I even dreamed of an evil spirit! At the same time, Hugh also remembered the thing that made her feel awkward, but the long-term bounty hunter experience made her not reveal any abnormalities.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She traced the trend and thought about the origin of the paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hidden in the mezzanine of the History of the Aristocrats of the Kingdom of Lun... History is borrowed from the study of the Viscount of Glylint...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, Firth and Hugh’s mind flashed at the same time. The name of a person:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory Viscount! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This name is rare.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it sounds great! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, he looked around with a puzzled look, for Firth and the rest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Why are you looking at me like this?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is nothing." Hugh and Folsch both shook their heads at high frequency.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, In an elegantly decorated house.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey took Jinmao big dog Su Shi, under the guidance of psychology teacher Islant, entered the living room This is a good "academic" gathering last week.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her maid, her bodyguard, all stayed here, and she and Su Shi Going to the spacious living room together.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the living room, I don’t know if it’s for the atmosphere, or for any other reason, the gas wall lamp is not lit, the light of the room It is all served by a candle on the coffee table and several gold-plated lamp holders on the cabinet.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey has not had time to observe the environment carefully, and she will see one A 30-year-old gentleman wearing a gray tuxedo came over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the owner here, Mr. Stephen Hampres, furniture trader. "Island, who has long hair and waist, said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is preparing to speak Audrey's identity, but Hampres laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Island, don't talk, give me a chance to guess. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has two neatly trimmed mustaches and a pair of fascinating dark brown eyes that look very gentle, unlike furniture merchants, who are like university lecturers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully looking at Audrey’s eyes, he smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Island I only said that you are her student, huh, I think you are a trained aristocratic lady, and it is not the kind of imaginary type, you no doubt do not have to worry about the decline in the quality of life...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a little excited, you are very curious, you are relatively simple, full of love...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, the most obvious point You are very beautiful, just like an angel! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally made a joke, then pressed his chest and bent over:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Welcome, beautiful lady angel. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are right, you are a member of the "Psychological Alchemy Club," but you have observed me a few months ago, all of me. Deliberately expressed himself... Audrey was surprised and stunned: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Hanpres, did you know me before? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't let the horrified expression stay too much on her face, because similar emotions themselves are a reaction in an instant, and it is impossible to last too long.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a surprise is reached for a few seconds, it means that his performance is likely to be pretending.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Audrey didn't notice this at first, but observing others' "playing" for a long time, naturally summed up a lot of rules.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I am I don't know you now, it's just a basic literacy for a psychologist. "Hampres chuckled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice has not fallen, Audrey has completed his observations and combined with the surrounding environment, made The corresponding judgment: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His dress, his house furnishings, all indicate that he is a person who cares about his own decent...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although he was very enthusiastic, his standing posture, the pointing of his feet, and the change of his mood and color all indicate that he still has a lot of concerns and is quite alert...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "He sincerely praised my looks, but it is not like men watching women. There are traces of skin care products on his face. The eyebrows must have been painted. The craftsmanship is not as good as my makeup maid, Soria, but better. I... his perfume is 'confusing', I only saw women use it... Hey, he should be a man, and he plays a relatively weak side..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Audrey skillfully showed her yearning:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr.Hampres, I really want to Have your observations like this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the conversation, she smiled with a light smile, led by Hanpres and Islant, and the remaining seven or eight people in the living room. I know each other.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two geeks and psychologists who have descended aristocrats, some are university associate professors, some are rich children, for example, there is a young The father of the person is the owner of Philip’s department store, the most famous department store in Beckland.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the exchange, Audrey basically can’t listen, It is also a question to ask questions, fully expressing their curiosity and yearning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "academic" discussion, Islant, Hampres, etc. Deliberately mentioning the etheric body and the mental body, mentioning the spiritual world and the collective subconsciousness, and giving some relatively unique views, let Audrey gradually figure out some of the difficulties that are usually accumulated.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end, when she walked out of the house, Audrey looked at Islant, who was next to her. Slightly naively asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Island teacher, me, when can I be as good as Mr. Hampres in the field of psychology? ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Islant twitched his mouth, slightly side of his head, looking at her:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "quickly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Klein, who is preparing to enter the bed, comes again Above the fog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some sleepy news that was immediately awake by the "Magician" lady.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aurora will know the 'fool'? Know my name? ‘The real creator’ locked me? Klein sat up straight, as if he was an enemy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly denied the last guess, if the "real creator" did lock him, Mr. A has long been I have already collected the copper pennies in the gas meter, and there may even be a saint.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, only know the "fool" and corresponding The name of the name, know the clue in Beckland... Who leaked the news? Klein frowned and thought about it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he found a Possible:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a recent "sun" mourning my name, and it was at the time of the intersection with the exploration team members polluted by the "real creator" ... He held a sacrifice ceremony. The scene should have the symbol of the "fool", and there is an ancient palace above the fog... So, the "real creator" perceives the existence of the "fool" and confirms that I am Hey, wrong, harassed, not right, peeping at his fellow...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the little "Sun" used "Eye of All Blacks", which contained the spiritual pollution of "Real Creator"... Through this, He made clear that my beggars or believers were born in Baekeland.德?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Eye of All Blacks" cannot be taken out in the future!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understand After the problem, Klein fell into a problem: Mr. A offered a reward for "fool" in a party that was not too private and relatively open. Believers, is the brain really not enough, or deliberately "fishing"?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
