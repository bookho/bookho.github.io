			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Foolish?” The extraordinary people who attended Mr. A’s meeting either chewed the word or whispered with their companions to discuss whether they had met someone with similar beliefs. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did such a cult appear?" Someone whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Mr. A asked the waiter next to raise a blackboard with a few lines of words written in Lunwen:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fool who does not belong to this era;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mysterious ruler above the fog;<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king of yellow and black in charge of good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of reviewing the blackboard, Mr. A used hoarseness to make people quite Comfortable voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t read the above in Hermes, Giant, Elvish, Dragon, and Ancient Hermes are even worse. You can't even use them to write the corresponding descriptions, otherwise there will be terrible things happening with great probability.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me find those who believe in 'fool', of course, they also May follow the 'mysterious master over the fog', 'the king of yellow and black who is in charge of good luck', as soon as I get a little clue, I will tell me immediately that the reward I will give is beyond your imagination! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This description...sounds like a terrible existence, a similar name I have only seen in the seven gods' books! "A member of the party was amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companions shook their heads:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many Objects believed by cults will have similar descriptions. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What a cult? "The other party members heard their discussion and stunned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be, in general, the spiritual creatures we summon, maybe Such a three-segment description, but one of them must be 'who cares about who's or who's like 'who belongs to who, who's what's not going to be this form! A party member who is proficient in occultism gives a theoretical basis.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While they are communicating enthusiastically, Fols is almost stupid there.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn’t this the name of Mr. Fool? Although it is described in Lunwen, I can’t be sure of it! How can Mr. A think about it? The Fool's believer? This is the intention of the Aurora meeting? Fols's mind is a mess.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that Mr. A is a member of the Aurora, because of the previous In the assassination of Ambassador Bessley, a "terrorist organization" announced a high-profile responsibility.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short mistake, Fols looked down on himself and worried about being People find themselves to be members of the Tarot Society, in some sense the "fool" leader.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just follow the ancient Hermes on that piece of paper After reading the name of Mr. Fool, he was dragged into the fog. No one knew this thing at all, and he was not afraid to investigate... The paper that wrote the name of Mr. Fool was sourced, and it was hidden in the books we borrowed from the Viscount of Glylint... Foll thoughts flashed.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupids who are not in this era... Isn't this the description I saw on that piece of paper? I even dreamed of an evil spirit! At the same time, Hugh also remembered the thing that made her feel awkward, but the long-term bounty hunter experience made her not reveal any abnormalities.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She traced the trend and thought about the origin of the paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hidden in the mezzanine of the History of the Aristocrats of the Kingdom of Lun... History is borrowed from the study of the Viscount of Glylint...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, Firth and Hugh’s mind flashed at the same time. The name of a person:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory Viscount! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Viscount Glenlint is looking at the blackboard and whispering with interest:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This name is rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it sounds very powerful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, he looked around in confusion, and said to Forth and the rest:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you looking at me like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is nothing." Hugh and Folsch shook their heads at high frequency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, an elegantly furnished house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey took the golden-haired big dog Su Shi, under the guidance of psychology teacher Islant, entered the living room, which was said last week. "Academic" gathering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her maid, her bodyguard, all stayed here, and she and Su Shi went to the spacious living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the living room, I don’t know if it’s for the atmosphere, or for any other reason. The gas wall lamp is not lit, and the light of the room depends on the coffee table and the cabinet. Several candles are provided by a gilded lamp holder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey had not had time to observe the environment carefully, and saw a 30-year-old gentleman wearing a gray tuxedo coming over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the owner here, Mr. Stephen Hampres, furniture trader." Islant, who has long hair and waist, said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is preparing to talk about Audrey’s identity, but Hampres laughs and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Island, don't talk, give me a chance to guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has two neatly trimmed mustaches and a pair of fascinating deep Brown eyes, very gentle, not like a furniture merchant, it is like a university lecturer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully looking at Audrey’s eyes, he smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Island I only said that you are her student, huh, I think you are a trained aristocratic lady, and it is not the kind of imaginary type, you no doubt do not have to worry about the decline in the quality of life...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a little excited, you are very curious, you are relatively simple, full of love...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, the most obvious point You are very beautiful, like an angel!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally made a joke, then pressed his chest and bent down:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome, beautiful Miss Angel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are right, it is a "psychological alchemy" Members, but what you observed was me a few months ago, all of which I deliberately expressed... Audrey was surprised and stunned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Hampley Sir, have you known me before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t let the horrified expression stay too much on her face, because similar emotions themselves belonged to the reaction in an instant. It is impossible to last too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a surprise is reached for a few seconds, it means that his performance is likely to be pretending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey did not notice this at first, but observing others to "play" for a long time, naturally summed up a lot of rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't know you until now, this is just a basic literacy for psychology enthusiasts." Hanpres chuckled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice has not fallen, Audrey has completed his observations, and combined with the surrounding environment, made the corresponding judgment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His dress, his house furnishings, all indicate that he is a person who cares very much about himself...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sapphire on his left hand ring doesn't look small, the actual quality is very general, and there is no symbol and magic logo... his economic situation is not as good as it is... he is vain...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was very enthusiastic, but the standing posture, the pointing of his feet, and the change in mood and color all indicate that he still has a lot of concerns and is quite alert...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
