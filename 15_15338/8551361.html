			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finding the reason for the maids to leave temporarily, Audrey locked the door of the house and looked back at the golden-haired big dog Su Shidao who didn’t know his pet: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you heard, amount, or what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;金毛大狗Su Shi calmly squatted there, snorted and swayed the surrounding air:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I heard the count and several members discuss things in the study. They said that the King and the Prime Minister reached a consensus and gave up the plan to retaliate against the Fossac Empire on the East Coast of the coast in a short time. Where is the East Coast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that Su Shi’s mastery of Lun’s language is amazing, Audrey’s feelings are more and more complicated. She silently said for a few seconds: “I will give you a map tomorrow...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "OK~" Su Shi replied cheerfully. "The King and the Prime Minister believe that the most important thing at the moment is to advance the reform plan before, and use public examinations to determine government affairs. Personnel, they hope to get this thing in the upper and lower houses before October."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really?" Audrey asked in a pleasant surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first thing she tries to hide with her own ability after she becomes a "viewer". If it can become a reality, it will make her full of achievements. sense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hao replied very honestly: "I can't give you a definitive answer. It's just what I heard. I can't even understand what they mean." After all, I am just a dog who just started learning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Audrey was briefly sluggish, and immediately burst into a smile, "Su Shi, you do It’s great! This is a reward for you!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a bag from a beautifully decorated cabinet, pulled the seal off and put it on Su Shi In front of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dog biscuit made from flour, vegetables, meat and water by Beckland Cares Pet Company. It is a favorite snack of Su Shi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Susie, who was sitting down, took his nose and raised one of his claws. It seemed that he was considering how to eat to meet his current status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, it gave up thinking, followed instinct, slammed forward, rushing to the door with the bag of dry food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It straightens up, opens the door with a single claw, goes out all the way, hides in the shadows, and starts to enjoy snacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday afternoon, at home, due to the value of the Chanis Gate After a lack of sleep, Klein took the trackless public carriage and once again arrived at the Dragon Bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had previously planned to use the divination method to find the "monster" Admirsol, to explore the other side of the strange reason, but the sudden change of control by the punishable Broken, I have to change to come today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the billiard room and enter the underground trading market, this time Klein didn’t have to look for it, he saw that Admiral was shrinking in the corner and shivering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired, messy, pale, ugly young man noticed Klein’s approach, suddenly squinting, against the wall, trying to move to the side door . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Klein had quickly rushed up, stuck in front of him, and quietly licked his left teeth twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his spirit, Admiral’s gas field is quite unhealthy, no matter which color, it’s a bit bleak, that is, although the other party has nothing Big disease, but the body is very weak. At the same time, Klein found that the emotional color of the "monster" revealed obvious fear and tension, and completely lacked the blue of rational thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of his astral body expands from the deepest part of the etheric body, and the color is completely transparent and colorless, just like pure light. Is this the speciality of the natural "monster"? Klein nodded invisibly, staring at Admisol's face, and spoke directly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What have you seen recently, what happened? Why? To hide in the corner and tremble, say that they are all dead, are the bodies?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Admiral lowered his head and looked at his toes. He did not seem to dare to look directly at the person in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was wearing a gray-blue trousers and a worn linen shirt, and he trembled in panic and replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, I didn't see anything, no, no, I just had a dream, my dreams were blood, the earth was dead, haha, hey, there are me in the dead, and me. I am dying, I am dying! I don't want to die, I don't want to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and cried again, and the content of the answer made Klein feel his thoughts. It has become confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lower temple, Klein whispered again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you afraid of me? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ademissol stunned for a few seconds and suddenly slammed down, fearing to be extremely screaming:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a gaze coming, and Klein was stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t do anything to you... Why do you want to shout like how you are being! He laughed twice and saw Admiral's curled up and shivering. He only begged for mercy. There was no other language. He had to distance himself from the other side and pretend to pass by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, maybe you have to ask Mr. Azick, but he went to the Northland resort of the Fossac Empire last week, and got Thursday In order to return... Before that, first report to the captain... Klein yawned and turned away from the underground trading market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving this week’s salary, his private money stopped bleeding back to 8 pounds and 10 sul, but for those extraordinary materials, he still can only take a look. Of course, if you are not afraid of too much interest, you can go to the owner Swein to do a loan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While walking out of the Dragon Bar and waiting for the public carriage, Klein’s thoughts diverged to think about the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With one week left, the first 12 pounds to be withdrawn will be paid off, and the money from home will finally reach 3 pounds per week. There is no excuse for Melissa to delay the employment of the miscellaneous maid. ... another 3 pounds for a while, then some private money..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, as soon as possible from Dust Goodlin Get the 'Reader' formula or find the corresponding clues, in order to give the funds for the reasons, exchange cash from Miss Justice... This can be done through the bank's unregistered account. In the process, I will use the divination method to do certain Interference, this is very safe and will not reveal my secret..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;On the public carriage, Klein did not go directly to the Black Thorns Security Company, intends to sit in the Divination Club for two hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to prepare for the next step in the "digestion" potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, for Klein, he is also a bit of a reputation in the "industry" of divination. The old customers in the past have "visited" again. Introducing a friend, if it happens, he may even have more than ten businesses in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, even if he only goes twice a week, he can get about half a pound of income. For the poor Mr. Fool, this is not small. Make up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, unfortunately, the words were too good to be said, the image was too perfect, and the cost of divination could not be changed at will..." Sitting in the conference room of the club Klein thought about it while drinking Xibo black tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his current fame, even if he receives 4 Soules at a time, some people come to divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as a diviner who respects fate, he can only continue to maintain the price of 8 pence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Klein has now thoroughly digested the potion, he is not willing to take the risk of violating the "Divinity Code" he summed up before, including the absence of divination. Obtaining extraordinary benefits, after all, he does not know if this will lead to out of control or other bad things happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——There is no “digestion” in the information inside the night, so Kline cannot judge whether there is still a certain risk after thoroughly digesting the potion, and cannot act against the corresponding “rules”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he considered these things, the beautiful reception lady Angelica came in and walked to his side, lowered her body and whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moretti, someone looking for your divination, 'red agate' room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good "Klein came to confirm whether it is appropriate to go to the club today, and got a positive answer from divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a half-high silk hat and walked out of the meeting room and saw the customers waiting at the door of the "Red Onyx" room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This customer is a 16-year-old girl wearing a light blue ruffled dress with a matching color hat and a natural head The brown hair of the roll, the cute face of a baby fat, the beautiful light blue eyelids of the double green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elizabeth?" Klein recognized this as a sister's good friend, studying at Elizabeth in Ivos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once helped the other side to pick the amulet, and also solved the Selena Mirror divination with the help of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth also smiles: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moretti, really you? When I saw the name, I was thinking about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After all, I am a occult enthusiast." Klein reluctantly explained. Then added, "Don't tell Melissa, um, and Selena."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of my divination are obviously suitable for the club, how come What about Elizabeth? He shook his head and turned to open the door of the "Red Onyx" room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he scorned the left teeth twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After slowly entering the room and sitting in the position of the diviner, he looked up at Elizabeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a glance, his brow wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s gas field color was dyed with a layer of dark black shade! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Signed by ghosts and grievances... Klein calmly judges and asks directly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Do you have a nightmare often, and some things in the dream are repeated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth, who just locked the door, still has time to sit down and be surprised I got there and replied for a long time: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...this is what I am looking for."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned back and said: "What dream did you do? When did you start?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From me In the last two days of the holiday in Ramd town, hey, my family has a small manor there.” Elizabeth is also a half-occult lover, and I have already thought about it more clearly. “I am dreaming. He always meets a knight in black full-body armor. He carries a huge broad sword and his face is completely covered by the helmet's visor. He can only see a pair of twinkling red eyes. He Straight trying to get close to me, I was afraid to run away, closer than once..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it: "Doing a similar dream Two or three days ago, have you ever been exposed to antiques, ancient ruins, or funerary objects and mausoleums?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth recalled a dozen seconds: “I, I am In those few days I went to the hill near the town of Ramd, where there was an abandoned castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the beginning of the standard fantasy novel...Klein Silently spit a word, ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, do you have any items left in the castle? Or what items have you taken away from the castle?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth wrinkled a good eyebrow, and after a while he asked indefinitely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
