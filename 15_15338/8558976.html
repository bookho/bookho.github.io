			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cynthia faintly can feel the introverted and deep pain and helplessness of Admiral Amyrius, no more to say, just hug him Use your companionship and dependence to give you the power to calm your mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple dinner, Klein took a hot bath and went into the quietest room, lying on the bed and staring at the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that he is now immersed in Admiral Amyrius’s "role" because of the helplessness of destiny and the hiding of pain, with himself The life experience is similar, which produces a strong resonance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not already clear and inseparable, I might be a little lost now... Oh, it’s like some actors in my life, acting in the role Too deep to be able to come out, so that there are spiritual problems... And for the extraordinary, the mental problem may be magnified... While Klein is low, he clearly knows who he is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, a high-ranking admiral, a demigod, still has such a great helplessness, such a painful experience...power Can bring a lot, but not a panacea... Thousands of thousands of people, this is the most real side of a demigod... Klein saw the blushing moonlight gradually become obvious, dyed every piece of furniture in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, by resonating with Admiral Amyrius, through the contrast between the two sides, through the experience played before, Klein established in his heart At the same time, it is a more stereoscopic and more realistic image of Amyrius, and it also makes the relatively vague “self” more and more clear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a person with a strong feeling; Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who came from the earth but was recreated to some extent by the memory of Klein Moretti’s fragments;<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who has not had a long-term career, but who has profoundly influenced the choice of behavior in that experience;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person who is afraid of danger and who can overcome himself at a critical moment;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One wants to be lazy, wants food, wants to travel, wants to enjoy life, but People who have to work hard for more important things;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One likes beautiful ladies, but Those who can uphold the principle and not indulge themselves;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who loves money but is willing to spend a lot of money for his brother and sister;<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who always buryes his pain in his heart and shows his smile outside;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A habit is voicing in the heart, and the face is polite Person;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who can overcome psychological barriers but does not break through the bottom line;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who are guilty of performances;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is also a guardian, a moment to face Dangerous and crazy poor insects! Klein's mouth was slightly upturned and silently added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a thought flashed through his heart, and he seemed to touch "self" as if. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, Klein slept and his mind and body were peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the master bedroom, Cynthia is already asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was wearing a nightgown, her legs bare, and a stack of quilts stacked on it, gently rubbing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hands unconsciously scratched the skin, grabbing a red mark, a small bump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was in the dream, and saw the illusory and unreal beautiful starry sky, and saw the star that bloomed brightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her vision is getting closer and closer, and she clearly sees the star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling... Klein suddenly woke up from his dreams, and there seemed to be an indescribable embarrassment in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I make this dream? He frowned slightly, and some turned his head in disbelief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, he not only dreamed of Cynthia wearing only a silk robe, but also had a super friendship with the other party, and he also dreamed that he had seen naked body. Mrs. Shelen, the "funny witch", dreamed of Miss Sharon, who is like a doll, dreaming of Miss "Justice" who is still vague in her face, dreaming of Trischik, dreaming of Teresa, dreaming of herself. A beautiful woman I have seen, and then intertwined with them in various ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many extraordinary people and ordinary people, this may only be recently seduce, and it suppresses its normal reaction, but as a divination Home", dreams have special meaning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein quickly looked at himself and found that he was still standing tall, and the unsettled lust was like a flood, flowing everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the divination dream of the "Divination", but the external influence...there are enemies! Klein was shocked and soon had a judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he cautiously rolled out of bed and quickly put on the general dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, he has the "ninth law" spell and "squirming hunger" on his body, with a strong self-protection ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he was not sure about the current situation, Klein did not try to go above the fog, still see himself as Amyrius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm face, Klein carefully walked to the door and explored the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, he seems to have finally recovered his interaction with the real world, and heard many loud and chaotic sounds coming from outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clear chewing sound, an indulgent snoring, an angry snoring, and a sharp urging sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? Everything was normal before! Klein swallowed his mouth and used meditation to keep himself calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——He used the “Lingshi” to check the condition of the villa every day, but he never found any problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Guard? Secretary Rueran? The more Klein thinks about the current situation, the more he feels that things are different and terrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched the "ninth law" spell with one hand, letting the deep majesty exude, suppressing the uneasiness flowing in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left palm is forced, Klein twists the handle and opens the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not stepped out, he saw the waiter sitting in the red vest opposite the aisle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter has a lot of cooked or raw food in front of it, including steak, lamb, keel and Olavic lobster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the waiter picked up the big fish that seemed to have just finished struggling, looked up at Klein on the opposite side, and smiled dumbly:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General, I have always envied your food..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His belly is different from before, already high The high bulge is like the state of a woman who is seven or eight months pregnant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, the waiter raised his hands, biting the raw keel fish, forcibly tearing a very thick piece of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a red blood flowing through his mouth, and his chewing sound was so cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squirmed his throat and swallowed the food in his mouth. His high belly trembled as if it would burst at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the instinctive appetite control... Klein looked at the waiter in a dignified manner, wondering why he was associated with the wandering death due to overeating. Han steadily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t have time to think about it, and he didn’t try to save the waiter who was eating crazy because he knew that if the root cause of the problem was not solved, then There will be no obvious effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein moved his footsteps and proceeded cautiously toward the position of the master bedroom, according to the guidance of spiritual intuition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorway there, there are two maids, one sitting on the other, bending over and holding the other's throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and shook the maid underneath, hurriedly urging:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry, Praise me!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick, praise me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desire to identify with... Klein frowned, approached a few steps, and snatched the collar of the maid above.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, he slammed the other side onto the other side of the wall and stunned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Did not affect the maid and fumbled and climbed over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid underneath has been yawning, unable to open his eyes, even when he was caught in his neck The same is true, it seems that I have not slept enough.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene... Klein had the urge to flee here and ask the church and the military for help. Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the most powerful of the current Olawi Island is Admiral Amyrius!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now I am Amyrius... But if the situation is not right, the withdrawal still has to be withdrawn, and it cannot be played with life... Klein’s scalp is faintly smothered and pushed away from the hooded master bedroom door. Br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that came out behind the door was the indulgent, happy, and then the heartbeat accelerated, the bloody smell of the blood into the nose of Klein.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, there is a mixture of various body fluids, and there is a scene of indulgence in the mind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Then, Klein saw the blond secretary Ruer Ann.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood by the door and looked at it with a look down, the feeling of arrogance The essence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When someone came in, he looked back and found that he was Admiral Amyrius.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp His expression has not changed, his gaze has not changed, just like watching an ordinary person, a small person.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This secretary is very respectful, In fact, it was such an arrogant person. Klein originally asked if there seemed to be a rational sense of Rueran, but he saw that the other person had moved his eyes again. Master bedroom look like Central. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just looks normal... Klein follows Luer’s gaze and finds a white body up to three meters in the middle of the master bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a tree-like brown-green tumor on its surface, some of which have split and become flower-like organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members of the General Guard and male waiters in the house gather around, or stand or squat, or float or climb the ground to meet with those organs, and issue Heavy breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the General Guards and maids, grouped in groups, scattered on the bedroom carpet, indulging in each other's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the tall white pheasant with the "tree tumor" and "flower", and a brown "tree branch" stick out and participate Every group of carnivals on the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this monster... Klein has once again refreshed his occult knowledge, and his left palm is naturally drooping and ready to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the top of the terrible body of up to three meters, a head turned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a woman who has long blonde hair and blue eyes, a tall nose and rich lips, which is soft and remnant. Cynthia of the girly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twigs" waving "flowers" opening and closing room, Cynthia cheeks blushing down at Klein, with a bit shyly said:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
