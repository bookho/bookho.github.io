			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......God's general reason... I heard the pharmacist's answer, and Klein, who is a "clown", could not control his expression changes, fortunately. Yes, there is an iron mask on his face. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ "So, I really like Beckland. There are a lot of street girls here. They are outside the concert hall, the theater, waiting for the streets, they are professional, some are part-time. Originally a maid of women workers, it has different flavors. It is said that in some places in the West End, there are occasionally bankrupt aristocratic ladies, which is really desirable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "..." Klein pushed the iron mask that covered the upper half of the face and quickly shifted the subject. "Do you have any advice from your teacher about your choice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The pharmacist slightly shakes his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, he just kicked me out of the door after teaching the field of herbal medicine, let me Traveling to the mainland, experiencing life, damn, he did not tell me where to go after the potion material!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the pharmacist looks to Klein and adds one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you know where the medullary crystal of the 'Spring of the Elf' is, please be sure to tell me, I Will pay you, of course, you can also buy it first, then sell it to me, you are a lucky guy, maybe it will help me to fulfill my wish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein readily agreed, and thoughtfully asked, "When can I use it to exchange the 'pharmacist' potion formula?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, "pharmacist" is a very useful auxiliary occupation, which can be used to train helpers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not too fat, but the sleek pharmacist is flying fast:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can only teach my students."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the rule of the life school? Maybe even witnessed by a hidden existence, made an oath... Klein did not accidentally think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the pharmacist snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I can tell you Where to get the pharmacist's formula, it's in Beckland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good." Klein was pleasantly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discovering the "eye of wisdom" Mr. Lao has to open the guest again, he is busy asking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mr. Pharmacist, do you have the medicine to deal with problems such as mental disorder?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein This is a performance for the bodyguard, so she is more determined Affected by the "real creator", it became a potential madman and is trying to seek treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sedative, 10 Sule, I will bring you 4 at the next party. Believe me, this is definitely more useful than the hospital. I added some spiritual materials.” The pharmacist answered without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really expensive... In the underground trading market in Tingen, the sedatives from the hospital are 1 to 2 Sule, from the night squad, punishable The squad and the heart of the mechanical heart squad are 4 to 5 Sule's... The flashing room, Klein's acting is full of look to the "eye of wisdom":<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear sir, can I attend the next party?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, your performance twice proved you The kindness, young man, pay attention to the daily "Beckland Morning Post", when the fifth edition of the advertisement for the acquisition of goods by Ernst Commercial Bank, it indicates that there is a party here at 8:00 the next day, the weight and interval of the knocking on the door. According to the quotation, the first number is the number of times, the second one is light, the third is the long interval, and the fourth is the short interval, after which there is no meaning. "The Eye of Wisdom" Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The extraordinary people who are not official and have no organization, do not live as beautiful as you think. On the one hand, they must hide secrets, avoid the official, and be cautious and careful at all times. On the other hand, they must fight against control and fight against madness. We have too many similar deaths on these two things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if we avoided the official attention, we escaped control and madness. We are also at any time trapped in the lack of materials, can not find the desired items, can not get enough knowledge, I organized this gathering, so that everyone can help each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Unfortunately, now in the era of mysterious scarcity, many extraordinary materials have rarely appeared again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but I know some original Mr. "Inverted Man" of the island coordinates, there is a silver city "Sun" classmate who is always against the monsters in the dark. Some extraordinary materials can rely on them... Klein politely half-faced, facing the "eye of wisdom" The old gentleman gave a gift:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your character is admirable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sitting down again, Klein suddenly remembered something and asked道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., do you have magical items? Just like the kind of black snake sold to me, but don't be too serious too. Negative problems, I want to have a little self-protection ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intends to find the things of interest first, and figure out the price, and then determine the target accordingly . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t have money now, I don’t mean that I won’t be able to ask for the price without money... Klein silently added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pharmacist spread his hand and indicated that he did not have it or would not sell it. The old man of "The Eye of Wisdom" laughed happily:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have some, don't know what you want to buy? Give me a rough range."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes Some...he is mostly relying on the “generalist” approach of foreigners. Klein said without concealing the envy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Be better than myself Strong, not to improve the level of fighting, it is best to have magical ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say too detailed to maintain the image of his first-time winner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eye of Wisdom" laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have an item that is perfect for your request It used to be codenamed '2-081'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2—081?" Klein asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His doubts are only superficial disguise, and the heart is more horrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the seal from the goddess church, from the door of Chanis? Klein didn't expect to meet familiar digital codenames here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eye of Wisdom explains a few words at random:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many magical items have comparisons Obvious hidden dangers can cause certain harm. Therefore, the churches of the seven orthodox gods are collecting and sealing them, calling them 'seals' and distinguishing them with digital codes."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After lengthy disputes and exchanges, the Church of the Seven Gods formed a unified nomenclature, with '0', '1', '2', '3' to identify different hazard levels, among them, The '0' level is the most dangerous. It is said to be some terrible items that can destroy the country and even the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The seven orthodox gods at the '0' level and ' The 1' seal will inform each other and tell the other party what they own. Therefore, the codes of '0' and '1' will not be repeated, and the '2' and '3' will be sorted separately. There may be the same code."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has long known about the situation inside the night But one of the problems is very puzzled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you inform each other of the '0' and '1' street seal codes?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
