			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Tulip"... "Hell Admiral" Ludwell... This is a tiger before the wolf... Is this too unlucky? A little? Klein, who floated in the air, first discovered the ship that was getting closer and closer, and couldn’t help but look down on Anderson, who was carefully examining the monster with a dark dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson was quick to look back with a puzzled look, while waiting for a gray piece of black meat that could be ejected at any time, he said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your eyes are very strange, what happened..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice has not fallen, it has been conditioned Shut up, immediately noticed, one side jumped and rolled, avoiding the monster splitting body that made his nails grow fast, and flew to the side of the ship on the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the waist, Anderson suddenly snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell Admiral..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a good guy. As a pirate general who is known for his indiscriminate killing, he will certainly have no psychological burden to seek his own interests through the crisis of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he weighed, he found that he could use the attack of powerful monsters, kill the "stars above the enemy", kill everyone on the "future", and harvest extremely rich loot After that, it will definitely start! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My bad luck has not diminished, just changed the form, zero deposit and withdrawal? Anderson’s expression was distorted and he didn’t know whether he was crying or laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Klein’s mind also showed corresponding information:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell Admiral Ludwell, only Lun’s bounty reached 55,000 pounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is an extremely powerful psychic, the highest bounty among the seven pirate generals! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many pirates living on his flagship "Black Tulip", most of which are responsible for the undead and spiritual creatures he drives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is indiscriminate, but there is no abnormal preference for killing, just to seriously complete the work of putting the soul into hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has an inextricable relationship with the spiritual group, and is said to have a ring left by the ancient death god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein and Anderson stared at the "Black Tulip", the gold brooch on the garland of "The Stars" began to bloom in pure, bright but not dazzling Sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the captain's room, a figure is blurred and stretches quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is full of the ghostly atmosphere of death and tranquility, but it radiates the sunshine and the temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the existence of an abnormal violation, like the resentment made up of "sun holy water"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is both sacred and evil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "sun resentment" spreads his arms and flies out at an extremely exaggerated speed, embracing a gray-black piece of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the oil was burned and the sound of the "sun resentment" and the gray meat pieces canceled each other, and at the same time annihilated, no trace left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The star above the eyes", the eyes are deep and purple, the brooch is golden and bright, and the sun is flying out of the window of the captain's room to create one after another "sun resentment". They rushed to the gray-black meat that invaded the "future." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "bloodless" Heath Doyle protects Frank, Nina and other sailors, and uses the method of engulfing and digesting to resist strong vitality. Monster meat pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Black Tulip" is faster than Klein expected, but within a few seconds, it has entered the "Future" warning range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-skinned black sailboat slows down and stops at the edge, and it seems that it is not clear what is going on here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Klein saw a near-transparent eye in the mid-air corresponding to the "Future". It had a pale pupil and looked down on it. Not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...Psychic version of the telescope? After a second, Klein pulled out the revolver with his right hand and aimed at the eyes of the spiritual creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he hesitated, as the crazy adventurer, German Sparrow, the direct shot is the most suitable choice for people, but At this time, "Hell Admiral" Ludwig has not shown hostility, he may be scrupulously "the star above the" power behind Jia Delia, to maintain restraint, if rushing to kill his "telescope", will make the situation impossible Avoid moving towards more chaotic and dangerous development! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Klein’s brief hesitation, the almost transparent illusory eyes disappeared. The "Black Tulip" in the distance continues to move forward and becomes more and more clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s above, a white cockroach with or without clothing or leather armor is busy manipulating the sails, the pale corpse of the long sword Patrol back and forth, using the eyes of the gray-green flame to look around, shadows, grievances, all kinds of weird spiritual creatures sometimes circling, sometimes burrowing into the hull, highlighting the transparent face with a small eyebrow on the side of the side . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Kline’s vision, there is only one living person on the “Black Tulip”, that is, standing on the front deck and looking at the captain’s dress man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears an exaggerated triangular hat with embroidered white feathers, wearing a white shirt with lace and a gorgeous brown short coat to hold the white tights. A fine thorn sword is hung on the leather belt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s face is covered with a silver-white mask, and the features and contours are hidden inside, the holes that symbolize the eyes, nose, and mouth. The icy lines are daunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly the same as the image of Ludver, the "Hell Admiral" in the rumor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His chief, second, third, sailor? Klein was first surprised that there was only one living person on the "Black Tulip" and then quickly relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the "Future", the three officers, the gunners and the numerous sailors were sent to the ships of their own pirate group, leaving only the minimum personnel to enter. Like this sea area, "Hell Admiral" Ludwell did not let the "fragile" subordinates follow, anyway, he could drive undead and spiritual creatures to manipulate the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the "Black Tulip" turned significantly, and dozens of cannons on the starboard side were aimed at this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With "Hell Admiral" Ludwig touched the silver mask, the sound of the bang came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannonball flies, or is not near, falls into the sea, explodes a wave, or jumps directly to the farther place . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a calibrated shot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the "Black Tulip" began a second round of shelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is about to start "squirming hunger", using the "distorted" ability of the "corrupted baron" to allow the shells to change their targets and bombing further afield. But saw Anderson Hood raise his right hand and push forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An orange-colored firecracker instantly condenses, circling and flies out, accurately intercepting each shell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! Bang! Bang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mid-air flares, the fragments splash, like dozens of fireworks in a row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have to say that the "arsonist" ability is really useful at sea, the mysterious version of the ballistic missile defense system ... but this is also because Anderson is "the most "Strong Hunter" has reached the level of Sequence 5, and changed to Daniz, there is no way to intercept it one by one. Even if he can detonate half, even if he is powerful... Hey, when I use the ability to "manipulate the flame", I can only deal with one at a time. Klein sighed, "Black Tulip" stopped the shelling, the speed became faster again, shortening the distance from the "Future". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as it approaches, the seas with golden sunlight in the two huge sailboats are flying black and black, not as dark as ink, as deepest and deepest. A starless night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dark and deep ocean, a translucent and semi-unreal creature crawled out, a pale body sticking out their rot The palm of the meat strip, the blossoming or the deep red or the cold flame emerges to form a pair of eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
