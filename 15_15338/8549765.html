			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Klein, Leonard’s smiles nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do they need to provide?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has worked with Lao Neil and others many times, and naturally understands that divination requires media, especially if the "protagonist" is not present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it and looked to the butler: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need Elliot I recently passed through the clothes that have not been washed, and it would be better if I could have the accessories that he had worn with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to pick the normal medium, and Not the kind of thing that would cause ordinary people to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, the old butler is also a confused question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to carry the young Master Elliot Photo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Because we are going to find his whereabouts through divination... Klein didn’t know what to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is true, not to mention whether it will violate the confidentiality provisions, the old butler will also turn around and tear away the contract directly, and in the heart of the big Ruan said: "This swindler! If this can be useful, I might as well go to the most famous psychics in Ahowa!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nad Mitchell chuckled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Kelly, my companion, um, colleague, raised a strange pet, it The sense of smell is more sensitive than the hound, so we need the clothes that Elliott passed through and the items he used to help find people. You know, the clues are often locked in a rough range."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the photo, we also need it, and I must know what Elliott looks like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old butler accepted this explanation and slowly nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are waiting here, or go with me to Wickrol Mr.'s residence in the city?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Together, save time.” Klein replied succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to try his own extraordinary skills, but also has the simple feelings of saving others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, the carriage is downstairs." The old butler said that he took a black and white photo from his pocket and handed it to Leonard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a single photo of Elliot Wickrol. He is about ten years old, his hair is slightly longer, almost covering his eyes, his face is obviously The freckles are not too distinctive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard glanced at it and handed it to Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked carefully, took the photo into his pocket, then took his cane, put on his hat, and left the black thorn security company with the two in front, and stopped at The carriage downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior of this carriage is quite spacious, with thick carpets and small tables with items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the existence of the old butler, Klein and Leonard did not speak, quietly feel the carriage in the gradual raindrops, on the paved road Go straight ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good coachman." I don't know how long it took, Leonard broke the silence, and laughed and praised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Klein was perfunctory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler is squeaky and smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your compliments are his honor We are almost here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the fear of being kidnapped, the carriage is not close to the residence of the tobacco merchant Vickroll, but is parked in a nearby By the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old housekeeper carved an umbrella and returned alone. When he waited, Leonard said to himself from Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guessed the reason, There is no other purpose, just to tell you that the note will definitely appear again, maybe soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really not a pleasant inference "Klein pointed his chin to the position of the driver outside, indicating that there are others in the situation, do not discuss sensitive topics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard whispered and turned his head to look out the window, only to see a drop of rain sliding over the glass, leaving a mark of ambiguity, letting the outside world Completely blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Carrie returned with a bag of things, because he was too anxious, his feet were full of muddy water, and there were many wet marks in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the clothing that Master Elliot passed yesterday, this is the storm talisman he had worn before."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a look and found that it was a miniature version of a gentleman dress, a small shirt, a small vest, a small bow tie, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the storm talisman is based on bronze, engraved with symbols that symbolize the wind and the waves, but did not touch Klein's inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will now tell you the details of the abduction of Master Elliot, so that you can lock in the target..." The old butler sat down and repeated Morning nightmare experience, hope that the helper can not find it can play a role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and Leonard have no interest in the specific process, only concerned with the number of kidnappers, whether they show unusual places, whether they carry weapons . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three", "Normal", "With guns"... After getting the information they wanted, they bid farewell to the old butler and hired a nearby Take a two-wheeled carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the public carriage, this kind of employment has four rounds and two rounds, which can be calculated in kilometers or charges according to time. The former is 1 kilometer and 4 pence in the city. , 1 pence 8 pence in the suburbs, the latter is 1 hour 2 Sule, less than 1 hour, according to 1 hour, more than 1 hour, plus 6 pence per 15 minutes, less than 15 minutes, charged for 15 minutes, encountered In bad weather, or in an emergency where speed is needed, prices will rise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened to the Azick faculty member, in the capital of Beckland, the taxi driver was known for the random price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, this is quite a luxury, but he doesn’t have to worry about it now, because Leonard directly lost to the coachman two 1 Sule's banknotes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to time." Leonard ordered the door and closed the compartment door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you going?" The coachman with two banknotes asked with delight and awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute." Leonard turned his eyes to Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded slightly, took out Elliott’s clothing, laid them on the carriage floor, and wrapped the storm charm on his cane . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held the silver-plated black cane and placed it straight on Elliot’s clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "light ball" in the mind condenses, Klein feels so fast, and the brown of the eye turns deeper and enters the state of semi-meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only feels that the "spirit" of the body has signs of becoming light and floating, vaguely seeing the ubiquitous "world of the spirit", and meditation in the heart Llight's location." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven times, his hand left the black cane, and the cane did not fall down, standing there vertically, even if the carriage was slightly sloshing ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the fine and invisible movements, Klein seemed to feel a pair of indifferent eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this period of time, he will occasionally experience similar feelings in the state of vision in meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these tiny creeps, he stared at the cane with his dark black eyes and meditated again in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elliot's position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just finished meditating, the silver-plated, wooden, black cane fell and fell to the right In front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go straight." Klein held his cane and lowered his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is a bit ethereal and seems to penetrate into the unknown world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the divination abilities he has mastered, called "the scepter", the props must be wood, metal or a mixture of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, this must be done with two real wands - shaped like a non-curved wire, at right angles, then hold the shorter one On the side, to determine the direction by turning, but as a "divination family", Klein has practiced and found that he can directly use this method of searching for people, or he can use a cane instead of a rod. The direction of the things you are looking for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the notes of the Antigonus family, because Klein couldn’t remember it, he couldn’t find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go straight." Leonard yelled at the driver, "I will tell you when I turn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coachman did not understand why he had to do this, but the banknotes in the inner pocket and the other party did not hesitate to give the image of money, so that he did not open his mouth and chose to accept it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage slowly traveled and passed through one street after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, Klein used the "buddle to find things" several times to correct the direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the carriage circled around a building, he finally confirmed that Eliot was inside, at this time farewell to the old butler, just past three ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the coachman was sent, Klein did not use Elliott’s clothing to directly smash the cane wrapped around the storm charm to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyelids deepen again, and the raindrops around him suddenly swirled in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cane fell to the front, and Klein pointed to a stairway:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sometimes, I am very envious of the old Neil, the same, and now I envy you." Looking at this scene, Leonard smiles and sighs Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at him and replied plainly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not difficult, You can learn as long as you like... Your inspiration should be very high?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard nodded and chuckled:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a good thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped up and walked into the rain in the end of the rain staircase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is afraid of smashing his formal attire, almost trotting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This building has only three floors, similar to the unit building on the earth. There are only two houses on each floor of each entrance, and Klein is on the first floor. And on the second floor, they used a "buddle to find things", and the cane was steady and pointed to the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two took a light footstep and arrived on the third floor, and Klein again lighted the silver-plated black cane to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A breeze blew through the stairs, his eyes changed color, and the darkness seemed to suck the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be an invisible crying around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s palms are loose, and the cane that wraps around the storm talisman stands proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And silently read "Elliott's position", he looked at his black cane and fell down, landing silently pointing to the room on the right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
