			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call! Lotus! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge breathing gas was slowly and regularly introduced into Klein’s ear, and he heard his spine chilling, feeling fearless in his heart, but not dangerous. Premonition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not just him, "Star above" Jia Delia, "toxin expert" Frank Lee and all other pirates have heard this gasping, they or Looking around the head, or looking out, or picking up a weapon, or being on high alert, shows the richness of its own experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly distinguishing, Klein found that the violent gasping came from the ruins on the side of the side, from the stones stacked on top of the sea and Between the stone pillars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "bloodless" Heath Doyle emerged from the shadows, his hands covered his head, and he snorted in pain: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a body...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a body there! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body? A huge gasping body? Klein thoughts turned around, subconsciously took off the heavy glasses and looked at the ruin of the garde. The face suddenly became dignified. Head to the pirates in the restaurant:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Accelerate to get around, don't get close!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is a little magnetic, Awakened everyone, the sailors immediately rushed out of the restaurant and went to the places where they needed help. Under the command of the voyage chief Ottolov and the sailor Nina, they adjusted the sails, changed the route, and crossed the ruin from a farther place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the peaks stacked on the stone pillars disappeared from the Haiping line, the "bloodless" Heath Doyle put his hands down and his expression was no longer so painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Klein blinked his eyes and felt that the "Royal Bishop" and the "Future" second officer may be the voyage. A big hidden danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not his discrimination against the extraordinary people of the "secret people" approach, but rather the description of "the star above" and the performance of Heath Doyle. Judgment: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just now, everyone heard a huge gasp, but only Heath Doyle became painful and intuitively believed in the ruins The body was buried, and the performance of the review after Jia Delia indirectly proved his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, even if Heath Doyle does not actively listen to the voice of the "real creator", he will have the extraordinary ability to "listen" In the normal environment, I hear more than the average person and most of the middle and low sequence. When you meet the breathing, just when the sound source is close enough, he will be more affected and get more dangerous information<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here, It is not to avoid similar ruins and relics, but to solve the corresponding problem, because according to the "Star above" Jia Delia, this sea is full of sounds that should be heard that the gods are out of control, if not One day, Heath Doyle is in a bad state or too good, and maybe he will hear the "fatal whisper." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the "Royal Bishop" of Sequence 6 is not too different from the half-god who is not good at listening, and it is not too big. The explanation is that you only need to cast 2 points instead of 1 point. Heath Doyle will go crazy or get out of control in the voice that shouldn't be heard... I have to remind Ms. "The Hidden", although she should be able to I thought that there was a corresponding preparation... Klein took back the line of sight and heard that his stomach made a less obvious snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not had time to use breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the ale was sprinkled on the ground, the cream was trampled everywhere, the fried fish, toast, white bread and other foods were lying down. Either hanging, it has become quite dirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside layer should be removed and you should be able to eat... Klein looked at a loaf of bread leaning against the table and hesitated to take action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has some contradictions with the people of German Sparrow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Re-prepare breakfast for the rest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These give Frank, maybe, maybe he is useful. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultivate "monsters"? Klein spoke in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while He finally ate a breakfast that was not as rich as it was: a smoked pork sausage with two slices of crispy toast, and a glass of ale without added sedatives as water.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of driving in a very dangerous sea area, there may be a change at any time. Klein played the style of eating a canteen in college, and it took only a minute or two to sweep the breakfast out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the pirate restaurant, he came to the deck, half a walk after a meal is to observe the environment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At this time, the sea is still illuminated by the midday sun, faintly stained with gold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stopped for a while and saw a light spot on the side It is getting bigger and bigger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is reflected in the sunlight, reflecting the fascinating hidden multi-colored glow, such as A huge, transparent gem.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "Future" continuing to sail forward, the spotlight gradually showed its own appearance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It splits first, and then clear, it turns out to be four huge pillars carved from pure diamonds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they Like the towers of the sea in the myths and legends, it extends downwards and stands firmly, holding up a small floating island.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the floating island, the soil The burnt black, not a little green. In its depths, the light is very bright, better than the midday sky.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a long scorpion came out from there. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is bright and pleasant, but there is no danger that makes people feel like hair.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing How long did it mean that Klein heard the sound of the horse running and saw two horses as if they were made of gold rushed out of the floating island, and they were carrying a gorgeous golden chariot behind them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, "Star above" Jia Delia's voice has been amplified to some extent, and rushed back to every corner of the "Future":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Below! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't look!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is never a stubborn person, subconsciously follows this Discourse buried your head and looked at your own boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed that the sun shining on the deck was getting brighter and brighter, and then it turned from decay to fast, and it quickly recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem." Jia Delia's voice echoed on the ship again, with no obvious mood swings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked up and found that the two gold-cast horses and the gorgeous chariots they were pulling were gone, the diamond giant pillars quietly supported With the floating island, the flow of the luxuriant mans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big diamond... A strange floating island, what would happen if you didn’t bow your head and watched the golden chariot rush out? Klein looked around, his brows were wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pirate who was only seven or eight meters away from him, has disappeared at this time, and there are two dark oily footprints in the original standing place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the ashes scattered in the air, Klein vaguely knew the ending that did not bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, "Star Over" has been there several times before, knowing which ones should avoid which ones to bow, if I hired "Down Man", Even if he is driving a ghost ship, it should have been destroyed now... No, if it is not the "future" to arrive at the destination in advance, without buffering time, I have already asked "The Snake of Destiny" Will. Related issues, the magician does not do unprepared performances... And, if you hired Mr. "Inverted Man", I will definitely buy the corresponding information from Ms. "Hidden" at the Tarot Conference... Klein first Sigh, and immediately restored calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next period of time, this ocean is like the outside world, leaving only the undulating water surface, empty, silent, boundless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein occasionally saw the fire floating on the surface of the sea, but did not find any traces of marine life, including the mermaid group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, and lunch is ready soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is about to leave the deck and go to the restaurant, and Huo Ran feels darkened around! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky that was always at noon has disappeared from the sun and is completely shrouded in rich darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change is so fast, so awkward that Klein’s first reaction was to turn off the lights! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent, the "Future" has cast a layer of awkward stars, illuminating the road to everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "hidden" 嘉德丽雅 slightly magnetic voice is once again magnified, echoing in the ears:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Return to the room, or just find a corner and let yourself fall asleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then wait for nature to wake up. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Toxin Expert" Frank Lee asked in a questioning voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If What if I don't sleep? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, his voice is booming, as if a giant bear is talking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia Deli Yali said behind the window of the captain's room:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When we wake up, we will find that you are missing and can't find it anymore." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night here is so horrible? Kline is curious and curious, but there is no idea of ​​not trying to sleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the room, through the "Future", the starlight that was not extinguished, spread out the paper crane, took out the pencil, and quickly wrote:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What are the things to be aware of in the dangerous waters to the easternmost part of the Sea of ​​Sonia? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where can I find the mermaid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the pencil and fold the paper crane Klein didn't take off his coat and lay down on the bed. With the help of meditation, he quickly entered the sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the gray world, he is sober and clearly aware that he is dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one was invaded... Klein looked around and found himself on the top of the mountain, behind and around the monastery’s black piece of architecture, in front A yellowed tree and a raised boulder,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top of the boulder, "above the star" Jia Delia sits alone, hands clasped, body Leaning forward, staring at the opposite mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is still wearing a classical black robes with a mysterious taste, and there is an inexplicable confusion in her expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, she did not have any movements, as if she had become a stone statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is she in my dreams? Klein took a few steps and jumped onto the boulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still in the future to ask, suddenly shocked by the scene of the open-minded, there is a feeling of physical and mental agitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of the boulder is the cliff where the bottom is not visible, and the cliff is a mountain covered by countless palaces, numerous towers and majestic walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buildings are magnificent and cascading, and the singles are extremely large. Unlike the places where humans live, they are combined with an indescribable sense of epic and miracle. And mythology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
