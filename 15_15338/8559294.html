			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call! Lotus! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge breathing gas was slowly and regularly introduced into Klein’s ear, and he heard his spine chilling, feeling fearless in his heart, but not dangerous. Premonition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not just him, "Star above" Jia Delia, "toxin expert" Frank Lee and all other pirates have heard this gasping, they or Looking around the head, or looking out, or picking up a weapon, or being on high alert, shows the richness of its own experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly distinguishing, Klein found that the violent gasping came from the ruins on the side of the side, from the stones stacked on top of the sea and Between the stone pillars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "bloodless" Heath Doyle emerged from the shadows, his hands covered his head, and he snorted in pain: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a body...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a body there! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body? A huge gasping body? Klein thoughts turned around, subconsciously took off the heavy glasses and looked at the ruin of the garde. The face suddenly became dignified. Head to the pirates in the restaurant:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Accelerate to get around, don't get close!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is a little magnetic, Awakened everyone, the sailors immediately rushed out of the restaurant and went to the places where they needed help. Under the command of the voyage chief Ottolov and the sailor Nina, they adjusted the sails, changed the route, and crossed the ruin from a farther place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the peaks stacked on the stone pillars disappeared from the Haiping line, the "bloodless" Heath Doyle put his hands down and his expression was no longer so painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Klein blinked his eyes and felt that the "Royal Bishop" and the "Future" second officer may be the voyage. A big hidden danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not his discrimination against the extraordinary people of the "secret people" approach, but rather the description of "the star above" and the performance of Heath Doyle. Judgment: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just now, everyone heard a huge gasp, but only Heath Doyle became painful and intuitively believed in the ruins The body was buried, and the performance of the review after Jia Delia indirectly proved his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, even if Heath Doyle does not actively listen to the voice of the "real creator", he will have the extraordinary ability to "listen" In the normal environment, I hear more than the average person and most of the middle and low sequence. When you meet the breathing, just when the sound source is close enough, he will be more affected and get more dangerous information<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here, It is not to avoid similar ruins and relics, but to solve the corresponding problem, because according to the "Star above" Jia Delia, this sea is full of sounds that should be heard that the gods are out of control, if not One day, Heath Doyle is in a bad state or too good, and maybe he will hear the "fatal whisper." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the "Royal Bishop" of Sequence 6 is not too different from the half-god who is not good at listening, and it is not too big. The explanation is that you only need to cast 2 points instead of 1 point. Heath Doyle will go crazy or get out of control in the voice that shouldn't be heard... I have to remind Ms. "The Hidden", although she should be able to I thought that there was a corresponding preparation... Klein took back the line of sight and heard that his stomach made a less obvious snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not had time to use breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the ale was sprinkled on the ground, the cream was trampled everywhere, the fried fish, toast, white bread and other foods were lying down. Either hanging, it has become quite dirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside layer should be removed and you should be able to eat... Klein looked at a loaf of bread leaning against the table and hesitated to take action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has some contradictions with the people of German Sparrow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he decided to wait for lunch, "Star above" Jia De Li Ya told the chef: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Re-prepare breakfast for the rest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These give Frank, maybe, maybe he is useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultivate "monsters"? Klein spoke in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he finally ate a breakfast that was not as rich as it was: a smoked pork sausage with two slices of crispy toast And a light beer that is not used as a sedative as a clear water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because driving in a very dangerous sea area, there may be a change at any time. Klein played the style of eating a canteen in college, only took a minute or two to put it Breakfast was swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the pirate restaurant, he came to the deck, half a walk after a meal is to observe the environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sea is still illuminated by the midday sun, faintly dyed with layers of gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stopped for a while and saw a light spot on the side of the side getting bigger and bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is reflected in the sunlight, reflecting the fascinating hidden multi-colored glamour, like a huge, transparent gem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the "Future" continues to sail forward, the light point gradually shows itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It splits first, and then clear, it turns out to be four huge pillars carved from pure diamonds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are like the towers of the sea in the myths and legends, they extend downwards, stand steadily, and hold up a small floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the floating island, the soil is black and not a little green. In its depths, the light is extremely bright, better than the midday sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a long scorpion came out from there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is bright and pleasant, but there is no sense of danger that makes people feel like hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, Klein heard the sound of the horse running and saw two horses that seemed to be made of gold rushed out of the floating island, pulling behind them. The same golden ornate chariot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "the star above" Jia Delia's voice got some kind of enlargement, and rushed back to every corner of the "Future": Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Below!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't look! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has never been a reluctant person, subconsciously following such words to bury his head and look at his boots.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed that the sun shining on the deck was getting brighter and brighter, and then it turned from decay to fast, and it quickly recovered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No problem. "The voice of Jia Delia resounded on the boat again, with no obvious emotional fluctuations.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked up and found the two gold-cast horses and The gorgeous chariots they have pulled are gone, and the diamond giant pillars quietly support the floating islands and flow out of the luxuriant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great diamonds... A strange floating island, if you don’t bow your head and watch the golden chariot rush out, what will happen? Klein looked around and his brows were wrinkled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pirate who was only seven or eight meters away from him, disappeared at this time, and there were two black and oily footprints in the original standing place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Looking at the ashes floating in the air, Klein vaguely knew the ending that he had not bowed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, "Star Over" has been there several times before. Know which ones should avoid this bow, if I hired Mr. "swing man", even if he is driving a ghost ship, it should now The group is gone... No, if it is not the "Future" to arrive at the destination in advance, there is no buffer time, I have already asked the "Destiny Snake" Will Anthony related questions, the magician does not do unprepared performances ...and, if you hired Mr. "Hanging Man", I will definitely buy the corresponding information from Ms. "Hidden" at the Tarot Conference... Klein first sighed and immediately restored calm.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not propose to take a look at the floating island, explore, let the "Future" pass from the side, sail forward.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
