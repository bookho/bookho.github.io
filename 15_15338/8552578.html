			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s first morning in Beckland was from pale fog, low visibility sky, cold and humid environment and 1 penny 1 liter cheap Tea, two pieces of toast sandwiched with inferior butter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was busy all morning, first went to the Beckland Post headquarters in Jowood, spent 30 pounds, booked for a month Small ads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Tuesday, the loyal readers of the Beckland Post will see a crease in the 7th and 8th editions. Small notice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock. Moriarty, a private detective who specializes in various matters, reasonable fees, strict adherence to confidentiality principles, living in Joe 15 Minsk Street, Wood District."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Klein did not choose the "Taxok", "Beckland Daily" and other covering the entire Kingdom of Lun The big newspaper is because his business is only limited to the city of Beckland for the time being, and he does not want to become very popular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the "Beckland Post", which is popular locally and has an inexpensive advertising price, became his first choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the headquarters of the Beckland Post, Klein took the map and purchased it from various herbal shops, flower shops, jewelry stores, and jewelry stores. Different plant powders and silver flakes are ready for the ceremony - most occult materials can be bought in ordinary shops without involving spiritual items, but they are not so concentrated and need to run a lot. The family can get together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, Klein used a full five pounds, and the huge fortune of 200 pounds that fell out fell below the 100 mark, leaving only 92 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It costs the same as the water..." Klein found a small restaurant nearby and ordered a bark of 8 pence with black pepper sauce, 2.5 Penny's mashed potatoes with pork sausage, 1 pence of coffee, 1 pence of vegetables, because the total amount exceeds 1 sul, plus 1 pence, get 1 serving of butter-rich bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 1 pm, he returned to No. 15 Minsk Street, taking care of not taking a break, spending time first, using deep sleep flowers, dragon blood grass, deep red sandalwood Herbal powders such as fragrant and mint are used to make "sunny powder", which is the material used to make spiritual walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Before buying a real ritual silver plaque, he can only do it in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein guessed that he had to advance to Sequence 7, in order to get rid of this limitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call, Miss 'Justice', 'Inverted Man', "Sun" classmates have not yet taken leave, today's party will be called on time...I don't know What kind of surprises will Mr. 'slow people bring to me? How many pages of Russell's diary can be provided...” Klein leaned on the bed in the bedroom and thought about everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private detective is a career that takes into account both money and action, which allows him to reach out to people in various industries and slowly discover Baekeland. The circle of extraordinary people in Germany gradually found clues to the secret society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if luck is good enough, he can even figure out what the "clown" corresponds to in the circle of some extraordinary people, and buy the corresponding Potions recipes and main materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the whereabouts of Ings Zangweier, Klein will not take the initiative to look for it, and may even want to avoid the other side, but if you can accidentally find this The enemy did not expose himself. He did not mind doing a good deed and anonymously sent a letter to the Church of the Dark Goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The private detective's income can be maintained at the most, and if you want to have enough money, enough to buy the potion formula and extraordinary materials, one is to see Miss 'Justice' there, the second is to make a certain investment, using the remaining 100 pounds in the unregistered account... Well, the 92 pounds on the body can't move for a while, maybe I have no money for a long time... "Thinking of this, Klein suddenly turned over and sat down to the first floor, and began to read the various newspapers that he had bought before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These newspapers often post news, such as what invented something, seek investment, such as a joint venture between a certain person and a person, what career? . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 2:45 pm, he returned to the bedroom, locked the door of the house, pulled up the curtains, and created a spiritual wall with "Sunday Powder." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverse four steps, come to the fog, Klein sits on the high back chair of the fool, extends the spirituality, touches in a way that responds to the prayer To the deep red star that symbolizes the "sun." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the few things that have changed in my life. I suddenly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain area outside the city of Silver, a semi-collapsed black Gray high tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine patrol members were chatting in front of the burning fire and chatting about this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, several players are on the periphery, guarding for attacks that may suddenly erupt in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how many people in Silver City tell them with blood lessons:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relax and be alert, the monster in the dark is probably behind your back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On nights with very low lightning frequency, it is necessary to keep the flame burning and keep the light shining. Once it is completely dark, it is not impossible to disappear. It is unclear what horrible things will happen in pure darkness, because the facts break through the limits of their imagination again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick Berg maintains a restrained silence, quietly listening to the companions who remember the monster they had encountered before, the humanoid monster with eyes full of eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to solve this monster, their patrol paid five people for injury, and the two had a serious price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Dairik’s eyes were in front of him, feeling that he was surrounded by thick fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance that cannot be described, in the depths of the fog, a vague figure sits on the old high back chair and looks at it in a overlooking posture. he. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare for the party."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrek echoed the voice of the fool, but None of the teammates around him noticed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting the line of sight and observing the environment for a dozen seconds, Dairik moved to the edge of the fire, backed by the broken wall, side to everyone, pretending to sleep . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the discovery of the members of the "six-member parliamentary group", the elder Lloydya could not find the existence of "fool", he gradually believed that as long as he did not carelessly Exposing some problems, it can be counted under the gaze of a gaze, he can quietly go to the top of the fog to participate in the Tarot party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Queens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey returned to his bedroom with excuses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She restrained her excitement, did not walk back and forth, sat quietly on the bed, waiting for the call of Mr. "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dad is busy communicating with other members of the bills that will be submitted, the extraordinary guards will no longer follow me, thank the goddess, my life has finally returned to normal ! Two weeks have passed, and Mr. "Inverted Man" is definitely ready for the pituitary of the adult colorful lizard... I am going to promote the sequence 8! Audrey’s eyes were bright and bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her, this is more exciting and hopeful than a big plantation with a reward of 30,000 pounds and a value of at least 8,000 pounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, she saw the familiar illusory crimson glow flooding and drowning herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old-fashioned sailboat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
