			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior of the Thunder Church, the dome is wide, the voucher is connected, the surrounding murals are connected, there is no blank, mainly gold and blue, let the people walking inside subconscious I feel sacred and solemn, and I can't help but lower my head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger Wilson often meets with hidden secrets and has long been in a palace like a god-like residence. This has no previous feelings, no longer so awesome, but He didn't show this. Like the sailors around him, he always looked down at the ground, put on a soft footstep, and didn't even dare to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a quiet atmosphere, they led by the pastor and went all the way to the clergy residence behind the church, each got a room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the door, Alger sees the moonlight shining through the window, making the environment cold and sinister, and countless ghosts seem to be separated A thin curtain looks at the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the "Blood Moon" appears, the spirituality will always rise, the power from the spiritual world and the hell will be greatly enhanced, and the negative emotions of the living beings will also be presented. The state of the explosion, the higher the sequence, the more obvious the feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the faint ambiguity, Alger heard the crying, low shouts, and whispers, which is quite different from his solemn feeling in the Thunder Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have an imaginary arm in front of his eyes, they extend from the wall, from the floor, from the ceiling, like a three-dimensional pale forest . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger knew the anomaly of "Blood Moon", took off the captain's cap without panic, entered the bathroom, and washed his face with tap water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, he suddenly heard a long and beautiful song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This song is ambiguous, it seems to come from the center of the island, and it is surrounded by it, as if it is right next to Alger, it does not make people feel fear, Just like a woman who is far away from her family and away from her lover, she is on the edge of the cliff, watching the rushing tide, sing and sing, and grieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger pulled a towel and wiped his face, then listened for a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gradually frowned, taking a small iron box from the dark pocket of the priest’s robes and bringing it closer to his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the extraordinary character of the "marine singer" he bought from the "world". He suspects that the spirit of the remains in the article is in the bloody month. Under the influence, there is temporary growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the iron box approaching, the songs of Alger’s ear suddenly became clear, and the emotions such as melancholy, sadness, thoughts, and pains were as substantial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in addition to this, there are still old and beautiful songs coming from the clear part of the clear distinction, it seems to sing one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is this song? Like an elf... an object from the elf inside the church? The extraordinary character of this "marine singer" in me From a fairy?” Alger had a guess at the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the same "sailor" approach, the Storm Church has been collecting the relics of the elves, some of them have been blended into potions, some as seals, Being isolated from the ground, some of the negative effects are small, and they are rewarded to the clergy. Therefore, it is not strange that similar things are excited by each other in the "Silver Moon Night". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s a magical item, there’s nothing wrong with it. If it’s a seal, the song’s ability to penetrate the isolation means it’s not easy... Alger regains his thoughts, brushing I got a tooth and lay down on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly fell asleep and entered a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Alger suddenly got a little awake, vaguely knowing that he was dreaming, but he had an active sense to look around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that the top is the deep blue water, which overlaps layer by layer, and the sky is invisible. In front, there is a magnificent palace made up of corals. , tall, magnificent, dark, and sullen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside, a giant coral pillar stood up, propped up an exaggerated dome, and the walls and tops were painted with murals depicting storm horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the hundred meters away, a seat inlaid with sapphires, emeralds, and round pearls is on top of the nine-story steps, which is particularly eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger looked at the past and saw that there was a woman wearing a vintage long dress, her hair was black and bright, and she was turned into a sorghum. The lines are soft, the facial features are exquisite, and there is a beauty that is not subject to prejudice due to changes in the times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman’s expression is indifferent, her ears are slightly pointed, and her palms are deep and deep, so she looks at Alger like that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hands are playing with a complex gold wine glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger is about to talk, the woman’s eyes are silver and strong, as if lightning is shining, rushing out, piercing the dream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Alger turned up and sat down, panting out, only feeling that the dream was just blurred and clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, the blur is the woman’s looks, the details of the murals and the specific appearance of the Coral Palace, clearly the lightning-like eyes and the slightly pointed ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A superior elf? Under the influence of the bloody moon, the items left by her have resonated with the extraordinary characteristics of the "sea singer" in my body, which has affected my dreams. Alger was speculating while thinking about what it would be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of his low status, limited knowledge of seals and magical items, and knowledge of other people’s unclear knowledge, he soon had a goal:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'The Scourge's High-Henham?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Book of God's Remains He Left "It should have been sent to Paso Island...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you finish your job, leave here and ask Mr. Fool’s to see if the matter will be What is left with bad influence..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Alger can't mourn the name of the "fool" at the headquarters of the Storm Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dawn, he did not show any abnormality. Under the guidance of the servant, he entered a room with a long table and accepted three "penalties." Deacon's inquiry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only one of the three deacons who have dark blue hair, because this is not a change that will occur after taking the "sailor" route potion. But this feature will be inherited tenaciously, like the elves, the original black hair more than the blue hair, but to the modern, mixed-race children of the elves, most of them are blue hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger sat down at the bar table and answered the deacon’s inquiries in a reasonable way, doing what he had done at sea during this time, intending to do What, what did it succeed, and what failed one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be compared with the descriptions of other crew members to prevent people from lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the debrief, the dark blue hair deacon looked at Alger, and the voice asked thickly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know the star above will be 'Jia Deliya?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not only know...Argel is almost scared, thinking about it before answering :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen it at the pirate conference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deacon did not entangle the previous The problem, straightforwardly said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Try to know her, investigate the situation of German Sparrow from her."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out to be the case...because German has hunt "the blood above"? Alger asked inexplicably: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did Gelman Spalo do again?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
