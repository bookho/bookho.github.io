			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After roughly guessing, Klein was not in a hurry to confirm that nothing was done with the equipment, turned the paper toward it, facing himself . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information he wrote about Ian Wright is absolutely true, even if it is confirmed by divination skills, it will get a positive answer, so he believes The ambassador's people will follow this line and get some gains. There is no motivation in a short time to spare time to retaliate against themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, he will continue to spread the paper on the desk, let the monitoring personnel of the special department of the military see and guide them to relax their attention to themselves, The focus shifted to Ian Wright in this direction, and the ambassador raced against time to find someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, Klein will be safer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I feel like walking the wire rope, is this the special physique of the 'clown'?" He smiled and shook his head, opened the belly window, and wanted to breathe two fresh air in the morning. But the thick, hot smog outside made him silently close the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using an ink bottle to hold the paper with Ian intelligence, Klein quickly cleaned himself up in the bathroom next door, and then removed the black hanging from the coat rack. Double-breasted long dress and half-height silk hat, all the way to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had an appointment with Mr. Jurgen to have breakfast today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a black and silver cane drawn from the umbrella stand, Klein came to Minsk along the edge of the street in a fog of no more than ten meters in visibility At 58th Street, the doorbell of the dark house was rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the resounding voice, a black black cat with a high tail was suddenly appearing in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black cat Brody walked a line of words, came to the door, saved for two seconds, suddenly leaped, and grabbed the doorknob. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, it inevitably falls, twisting the handle by weight and opening the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops, the morning wind blew, the door slowly receded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black cat Brody glanced at Klein with pride and walked to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a smart cat." Klein praised the old lady with a white apron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doris smiles wrinkles one by one:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It depends on its mood, Most of the time it will be stupid, I don't seem to understand what you are saying, hey, I have prepared for you the best bean curd soup, and eat it with bread."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beans Turnip Soup... Listen to the name like dark dishes... Kline smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking forward to it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, lawyer Jürgen walked out of the washroom, even in his own home, even if he had just got up, he still wore a meticulous, white shirt. Straight, the brown-yellow vest is tight, and the lines of the trouser legs seem to have just been ironed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The contract you want is well managed. Look at the missing areas." Jurgen Blue Sweeped, did not chill, went straight to the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brown hair is neatly combed back and can clearly see the luster of the head oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein leaned on his cane, took off his hat, took off his coat, followed Jurgen into the study room on the first floor and took it. A thick contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood there, flipping through it, the more he looked at it, the more he was in a hurry, and he only rushed through the key terms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that there is something, and the neglected clauses have been added. For example, instead of paying Reppard 100 pounds in one lump sum, set up three times. Point, according to his progress, the first period is 50 pounds... Yes, so I don’t have to go to Beckland Bank for the time being, I will take out the remaining 100 pounds in my unregistered account, and the money on my body will be enough. ... Klein folded the document and smiled at Ergen: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very satisfied, your professionalism is better than I thought."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he took out two prepared 1 pound notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgen took over the banknotes and gave the remaining contracts to Klein, rigorously saying:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is an error in the signature, there are two extras here, and the rest of the contract will be remembered to be processed with a shredder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current shredder is a hand-operated mechanical shredder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is on the head, and the old lady Doris in the restaurant shouts loudly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Two great guys, it’s time to have breakfast!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My grandma’s hearing has dropped somewhat." Jurgen explained, made a request Gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein followed him into the restaurant and saw the old lady Doris took a spoonful of yellow thick green liquid from the black stockpot and poured it into it. Corresponding plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on, taste, bean cumin soup, this is your bread." Mrs. Doris smiled and pointed at the pile of suspicious food. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at Ergen, only to see his expression more serious than just now, and his heart suddenly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly sitting, Klein took a piece of white bread and dipped the yellow-green soup to the entrance of the adventurer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." He was surprised to find that the taste was quite good, the savory salty taste of the appetite, just brought out the soft and fragrant bread. The level is obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My grandmother used to be an excellent chef." Jurgen took a soothing breakfast and spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Then why are you having a face...I don’t know how to eat when you eat... Klein’s belly swears and puts in food. Relax and have fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the Jürgen family, he first transferred to the transfer and went to the Saatchi Street in St. George's District, and reached a formal agreement with Reppard. The agreement pays the first £50, and the second £30 will be given in two weeks, depending on the progress of the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Klein had only 21 pounds and 8 solers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he returned to the Jowood area, where he went to the public library to look through the Tasok newspapers of the past year, looking for Intes in the Kingdom of Lun Ambassador related news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near noon, he finally saw the black and white photo of the other party, confirming that he was the one he saw in his dream divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beckron. Jean Mardin." Silently reading the name of the Ambassador of the Republic of Intis, Klein stepped out of the library and found a small restaurant to solve the lunch. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 2:50 pm, Klein took a break and pulled the curtains Going back four steps and entering the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He preemptively divined the military’s special department to monitor his own relaxation, got a positive answer, and then wrote a divination statement that he thought of in the morning: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sneak stalker last night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rescuing the back of the chair, meditating on the statement, Klein's eyes hang down and he entered the sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the illusory, fragmented, gray world, his bedroom emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Klein saw a black shadow creep in the gap at the bottom of the door! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slender, iron-black nematode drilled in, the central position was arched and leveled, and it circulated continuously toward the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very rigid, it seems to be split into a slow motion, a strange smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This iron-black nematode squirmed to the front of the desk and climbed to the top, leaving a fast-evaporating mucus road along the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stopped in front of the paper with Ian Wright's intelligence, and the head suddenly raised, and the central part was high and vertical, leaving only the tail to support the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, it is like a human! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the iron-black nematode pushed the paper to turn, then returned and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out to be like this...that is, the sneaker last night didn’t want to retaliate against me, it’s purely not that ability...unless this black-black nematode has a drama Poison... Klein nodded and used divination to confirm that the extraordinary man who manipulated the black nematode was from the appointment of Ambassador Intis, Becker Jean Jean Madan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he completely covered the corner of the paper bag with fog, and then passed the message to the "Sun" Dairik. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pointer to the pocket watch is in place, Klein pulls "justice", "downside down" and "sun" at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week’s “Talo Club” is on schedule! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Familiar fog and sly eyes come into view, Ao Lili, who was promoted to be in the success of the sequence, got up halfway, and put on a skirt, and happily greeted: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon, 'Mr. Fool'~ Good afternoon Mr. 'Inverted Man', in the afternoon, Mr. 'Sun'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelgen, who opened the mind early, with the special attention above the fog, noticed Miss Justice, the depth of the etheric body of the etheric body has changed, and the uniform color is purely a lot, so I chuckle: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to you , our 'Reader' Miss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ao Lili held a smile, modestly, and turned to look opposite:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Lower man", you should submit a six-page diary this week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe "fool" After the gentleman saw it, he would think of something again and tell us one. "Common sense" ...... looking forward to her mouth slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger nodded and began to present a six-page Russell diary with the help of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he thought about whether he would ask for "fool" and submit the remaining diary directly by means of sacrifice, but he did not seem to have much interest in seeing the other party. And gave up this plan again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in line with his knowledge that Russell’s diary has a role in the god-like “fool”, but not too much, He will collect, But never eager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six-page diary was completed very quickly, and Alger was about to present to the "fool" at the top of the bronze long table. He suddenly remembered something and was very respectful and open:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Mr. Fool's, I have heard about a secret seminar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ocean Above, the news is not blocked, just not timely enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big pirates also attach importance to intelligence, and often send people to the colonial islands to exchange the information they have collected. Alger knows one from this channel. The matter of the secret meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good." Klein gently decapitated and gestured to "downside down" to tell, there was no avoidance of the existence of Miss "Justice" and "Sun" classmates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This helps the former to collect other news from the Secret Society, which does not understand at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he let the six-page diary flash into his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"""" """" There is a certain connection in the Republic of Intis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republic of Intis... Also, Russell is the Intis, and Charato is in the cause Thiel, the capital of Tis, finds him... The follow-up meeting also participated in the famous event of Intis... Well, the secret society still has a certain connection with the Republic of Intis today. Too unexpected... Klein confirmed before and after, that the news provided by the "upside down man" is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
