			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, although "downside down" Alger has expected that "Justice" will not bargain, and the value of that magical item is indeed 5500 The pound level is offline, but it still has a strong sense of discomfort for such behavior. There is a kind of hard work and hard work, and it is hard to make a fortune. As a result, there is no disillusionment that others have more pocket money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"World" can be divided into 675 pounds, "craftsman" production fee is only 600 pounds, I can earn 400 pounds purely... In this transaction, I have invested a total of 1,075 pounds. Unfortunately, the "world" is not a simple character. He has many extraordinary characteristics and potions. He has participated in many incidents and can hear quite important news. It is not worth a few hundred pounds and him. There is a contradiction, otherwise I can push the price of his extraordinary characteristics below 4,000 pounds... "Put the man down" with a little regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the "fool" is delighted that there will be 3,825 pounds to be credited, "Sun" Dairik looks at the opposite lady and sincerely says:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss 'Magician', your foodie's stomach bag is ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good!" Fols was completely relieved. "I will pay 300 pounds of cash to Mr. 'swing man'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“倒吊人”阿杰闻The words, but also the spirit of a surge, busy to the top of the bronze long table, "fool" Mr. proposed an application for a potion formula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, he "written" the recipe for "Sun God Official" on the yellow-brown parchment in front of him:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 7, 'Sun God Official', main material: the red crown of the dawn rooster, the fruit of the shining Qiling tree, auxiliary material: the blood of the dawn rooster 100 ml, 'the sun '10 drops of essential oil, 8 grams of golden citrus powder, 5 grams of solidified melt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not deliberately spy on the potion formula, but Relying on him to present the content, still reflected in his mind, as long as he is willing to use the "dream divination" to recall, immediately get the corresponding knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him have to sigh silently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the platform is the most profitable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik looked forward to picking up the parchment, half relaxing and half experiencing it. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he has a list of monsters around the area of ​​Silver City, allowing "upside down people" to pick the extraordinary material for the difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""""" """" A material that clearly knows the buyer and the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting it, you should be able to get rid of it in two days, probably take 1000 pounds, count the 300 pounds of Miss Magic, and the previous 1075 Pound, the money of the longan sea eagle eyeballs has finally been enough... Alger is exhausted and flies to the side: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. 'Magician', You can prepare a deal for the longan sea eagle eyeball."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "downside down man" is now only a dozen pounds, even the cost of the advance payment to the craftsman is Borrowed by a wide range of contacts, but after completing this series of transactions, his cash assets will reach 2,375 pounds, enough to pay the 2,000 pounds required for the main material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Magic" Foer thought to the loss of the "downside down" last week, slightly grievously responded: <br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her, the final profit of the deal depends only on her teacher Dorian Gray is willing to divide her, and there is no additional income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the transaction, Klein manipulated the "world" and once again sought the remnant spirituality of the ancient grievances and the eyes of the six-winged gargoyles. For the sake of making or making magical items, he does not intend to pass the Tarot Conference for the time being, hoping to use this as an introduction to expand his network and channels at sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Free communication."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Justice" Audrey had to habitually speak, but after thinking about it, I felt that there was no news to share this week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to attending a banquet, I took two psychological lessons. Only back to East Cheshire can talk about it, but it is not necessary... She licked her lips and kept silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Fols is in the lazy state of the New Year holiday, his head is still blank, and he feels a little guilty:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beckland is still in the high-pressure state of the past, if not an official extraordinary, don't take risks recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes? During this time, the "moon" with good habits, Emlin, frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire in the three-point line can't understand the pain of all the extraordinary gatherings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Upside down man” nodded, thinking a little, thinking about the “sun”:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Don't care.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Before the sacrifice ceremony, it is best to confirm that the chief who led the exploration team is not in Silver City, or is busy with something else. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Down man", what do you mean, is the chief aware of the cycle of fate? "The Sun" Dairik stunned and asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted Man" solemnly responded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do not rule out this possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am not sure, after all, I don’t know enough about your Silver City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, he hides his smile and shows a dignified expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik said with some annoyance:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot of things I don't Clearly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"""" """" "" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your reminder." "The Sun" sincerely opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&#;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sea is relatively calm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this is just what you think... Klein silently refutes the manipulation of the "world" hoarseness:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just happened to hear about a thing at sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for the "downside down" question, he first Look at the two ladies, "Justice" and "Magician": <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ladies, can you buy a radio ticker for me?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...can give it a try." "Magic" Firth agreed not to care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are leaving Beckland, "Justice" Audrey can only say "sorry" about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about this transaction, "World" cleared its throat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Things are related to the Storm Church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to the church? Why didn’t I receive the notification? Don’t need to give it to us at this level? Wait patiently for the "world" to tell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"World" wanted to use the playful eyes to sweep the "upside down man", but because the action is too difficult, only Regret to give up, dumb and laugh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that things have been solved, but a lot of people have died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banxi Port... "Inverted" Alger recalled the situation there, taking the initiative Explained to the ignorant Miss Justice and others: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a tradition of living sacrifices, the goal is an evil spirit called 'the god of the weather' <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Overseas, in the South China, there are still many similar evil spirits. The surface seems to have been cleared, and actually survives in a strange state. Many people are violent in those places, huh, not necessarily because of illness, if you have a similar travel or adventure plan, don't care. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger is trying to describe the things in Bansin as an accident that happens by chance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he heard a slightly low laugh.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This laugh comes from the top of the mottled long table!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool"... "The hanging man" suddenly turned his head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Footer" Mr.! Not as simple as the surface! "Justice" Audrey immediately looked at the "fool" who sat on the high back chair.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See a road or doubt or Curious or excited eyes cast, Klein smiled casually, with a bit of memories: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This reminds me of a 'king of angels' . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The King of Angels"! The thing in Banxi Port actually involved a "king of angels"! Audrey’s eyes widened and he was "fool" The follow-up words of Mr. have produced strong expectations.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The King of Angels..." "Magician" Foers is inhaling and his face is bitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are we talking about why the "real creator" is coming, the "original witch" reviving, and the "king of angels" reappearing this kind of thing? I only have sequence 9! She just wanted to look up at the sky and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moon" Emlin is inexplicably excited and finds another reason why the first ancestor made himself pray to the "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, this is a savior gathering for the last days, we are all selected, will gradually face the "king of angels", "original witch" "Evil Creator" and other evils exist! Emlin suddenly had an impulse to immediately agree to the "upside down" deal, but the fact that he had no money ruthlessly shattered the illusion in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is the "king of angels"? "Sun" Dairik rarely participated in the topic of "Justice" and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The King of Angels"... What secret is hidden in Banxi? "Inverted man" Alger is eagerly awaiting the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Mr. "The Fool" did not continue to say, "Justice" Audrey couldn't stand it, and asked: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, which is the 'King of Angels'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned against the back of the chair, A chuckle: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Medic, who founded the 'Redemption Rose', whose blood descendants live in Binsi."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Redemption Rose! "King of Angels" related to "Real Creator"? Audrey did not expect that the first floor was more serious than the first floor. The subconscious doubts: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bingxi?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the ancient name of Banxi." "Inverted people" Alger hands with a virtual grip, low response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t imagine what is hidden behind this thing, only that the change of Banxi may not really end, and the danger of stalking is still hidden in the dark. At! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the "redemption of roses", he did not know much, just knowing that the term is related to the "real creator" temple, "destination angel" Uluos, can not Confirm what is specifically represented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
