			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a moment when Klein thought that "the disease lieutenant" Trey would do it directly because the other person’s face had already turned red due to anger, the blue eyes It’s a lot darker, as if the storm came to the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end, Trey was still impulsive and reckless, leaning his head and looking at Katrina Pelle, waiting for the "not old witch" to make Decide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very clear that although Sequence 5 and Sequence 4 are only one level difference, they have essential differences, and they cannot be compensated for by tactics. One belongs to a normal human being with specificity, one has entered the field of demigod, is a divine creature, a mythological creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the two players on the scene are obviously more than the sequence 4, and Trey is in front of them, feeling that he is a low sequencer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old witch" Catherine Pelle did not see the anger, looking at the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Kiringus face Klein, eye wave Circulation, chuckle out: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a funny young man, if not the 'Death Archon' here, I might not reveal my heart The vicissitudes of life, have a sigh with you, talk about a pure love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you don't want to... This sounds terrible... Kline doesn't dare Looking directly at each other, I can only look at the "disease girl" Trey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cartrina sees Azick Aegis without any expression, withdrawing his gaze and screaming at Trey with a beautiful voice like singing:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tear it in pain, this may be a good thing for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is now holy and dignified Looking to Azick: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember the batch of documents, which are all attempts to resurrect the god of death, but unfortunately they all seem to fail. At the end, they seem to be thinking about artificial death.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you still interested? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man-made death? How is the god of death? In addition to the "uniqueness" and extraordinary characteristics, how can there be other ways, this is not a Chinese cabbage... the past The Bailang Empire, the current spiritual group, will not be all crazy? Klein secretly swears a few words, without inserting a dialogue between the demigods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Azick sinks for two seconds and asks again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What cost do I have to pay? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catalina laughs very young:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought about it carefully, helping you to recover your memory a little bit, to get back to the past, to be the 'death consul' again, it should be very interesting The things that can bring more changes to the world are more fun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a rebellious girl... "No old witch "Not old is not only the flesh, but also the mentality? Klein felt that there was some way to grasp the other's ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the sequence 6, sequence 5, or sequence 4 of the "audience" pathway? He subconsciously speculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azk nodded, his right hand stretched out, and the paper and pen in the room flew on his own, as if there was an invisible spirit serving him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote the brush and lost the paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can summon me Courier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original copper whistle has only one...can maintain the effect for more than a thousand years, the copper whistle is not a simple thing...Klein instinct I just wanted to reach out and touch the Aziz copper whistle in my pocket, but forcibly held back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old witch" Catalina caught the paper, glanced at it, grinning:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I thought you would tell me directly where the underworld is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lifted her head, blue eyes with indescribable gentleness, smile Said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still remember how strong and cold the man was when the original 'Death Archon' was, which left a deep impression on me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Very curious, why are you now, your heart will become so soft? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick clenched his fist to his lower mouth and smiled and shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not dead It is not unfamiliar. Once people are old, they will always become gentle. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. Catalina was deep and said without a cover. "I look forward to the day when you completely retrieve your memory. I want to see how you evaluate yourself now." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, she squinted at her mouth and blinked at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe we are releasing a more horrible and terrible existence than the devil. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......This is a provocation... Klein whispered inside, but he couldn’t help but remember the record in the history books and the major churches. The "palm disaster" in the classics, which led to the death of a large number of creatures, turned the northern continent into a living hell, and the leader of this disaster is "death" and "original witch", which is the death of the southern continent. The witch sect, in which Mr. Azke, known as the "Death Archon", must also play a very important role...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azk is silent A few seconds, grabbing Klein’s shoulders, taking him into the spiritual world, walking through the house, the captain of the Black Death, and now there are only “not old witches” Catherine Pelle and “Disease Lieutenant” Trey茜.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter looked at the place where the two disappeared, and eased for a while before they clenched their teeth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I will not forget this! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catalina regained her holy gesture and smiled slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pain, The more painful you are, the more you can feel your weakness. The pain is at its best, and the desire to change oneself will be strong enough to help you withstand the potion, gain divinity in the ritual, become a demigod..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Disease in the disease" Trey hears this sentence, suddenly thinks of something, the expression is condensed, and asks: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ilian can escape The black death is because..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catalina is a light smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You are my youngest child, but the one who is most likely to become a demigod. As a mother, I certainly want to help you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trey's face muscles twitch, twisted and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I Have your mother, and a mother...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why didn't you tell me the truth, you know the medium and low sequence of several ways!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catalina turned her body, the white robe whirls, and the tone is whimsical:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be close to the 'original'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are all children of Him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her speech, a tens of meters long huge sailboats whipped up a turbulent but quiet black flame, covering every corner, burning silently, But they did not hurt the pirates on the Black Death, just like sorting out the ash.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cascading color blocks flew back, and the transparent figure that was difficult to describe went away. Klein’s spirituality suddenly touched, and all the items left in the black death number disappeared.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a “not old witch”... Klein sighed and was about to talk, but once again, he fell away and left the spirit world with Azick.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are in a valley, spread out along the river, have fertile fields, and have a Lun-like manor and town.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked around and found that the current standing position was a long abandoned black cemetery.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Azick..." he shouted in confusion. <br /><br />############# "After seeing Katerina Pellet, I remembered something again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I told you, one of my dreams, I In a certain life, there is a daughter, she has soft black hair, likes to sit on the swing I built, and ask me for candy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I walked through the spirit world, I suddenly felt the call from the blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Klein was infected by the other party's emotions and asked quietly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is her..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Azke nodded and squatted down, stroking the half of the tombstone. The bronzed side was gentle, sad, and confused:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is her grave.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I remember correctly, she has died 920 years..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;926 years... Klein wanted to say something, but was cut off by that long time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not the major churches Forced the dead to be buried in the cemetery, and have a certain care, and since the Fifth Age, there is no comprehensive war, this tomb and tombstone has long been nowhere to find.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human It’s been a few decades in a lifetime, and it’s 920 years.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abandoned cemetery was quiet for a while, Azick got up again and grabbed Klein’s shoulder:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I will send you back first. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few minutes of spiritual travel, Klein revisited the white sheets and the brownish floor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick pressed his own hat and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I continue my journey and you continue your adventure. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded and was about to speak, but saw Mr. Azick twitching his mouth and smiled and laughed:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it really worried that I will become a witch-like evil person when I completely recover my memory? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Klein replied, Azick sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also very worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, I want to find myself more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he was surrounded by the void The waves rippled and the figure disappeared into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stands in place and has no language for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and smiled silently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I have already It is the strongman of the angel rank, you can establish an anti-social personality treatment hospital, and the 'Justice' is the attending physician..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convergence thoughts, Klein sitting Had, habitually recollected and reviewed the action:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought I could graze a 'painful witch' and get death literature and missing persons cases Further clues, who knows that development and results are not expected, can only complete the most preliminary goals.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I can't blame Az Mr. Ke started, after all, he did not fully recover, and the opposite is a 'undead witch'... It is more important to be stronger and stronger. Asking people is better than asking for yourself. Oh, think about it, I often ask myself...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The disappearance of the population can start with the buyer, the 'crazy captain' Nas Victor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein changed his sitting position, nodded himself, and whispered in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
