The pocket watch, when you open it, you can understand where you should first go and listen to the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 11:00, the brothels and bars have not yet opened. Only casinos have already gathered a group of people who want to get rich and become rich. Guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger’s familiarity with the port city of Bayam is better than his hometown, and there is almost no pause in identifying the direction, and it’s smooth and winding. A casino outside the secluded alley with no signboards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as he knows, the owner of this "Golden Casino" is a gang of gangsters with a deep background, and the big man of the Governor’s House has an unclear but vague existence. Contact is the first choice for many pirates to get rid of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, there are often pirates here, they may change the looted items into thick gold pounds in the morning, and they have lost a mess at night. , was driven out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Algera pulled a thick brown coat, pressed the cap that was passed down the continent, pushed open the half-covered door, and watched in a bodyguard Next, enter the casino. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——In the interior of the Kingdom of Lun, the casino is not allowed, it can only be attached to the bar in the form of a room, but in the vast overseas colony of the kingdom In fact, it is not only legal, but also a pillar industry. Among them, Baiyam of the Rothde Islands and Allerse of East Byland are the most famous in this respect. Beckland and many rich people along the coast will go there and gamble one. Put it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking around, Alger saw a variety of card games, as well as carousel gambling derived from the scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the time is still early, there are not many gamblers, and Alger quickly "browsed" them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his eyes lit up and he was keenly aware of who the guy was after a make-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off his hat, went to a table playing Texas Hold'em, took the shoulder of the target, lowered his back, and leaned into the other's ear. , pressing the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"flame."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz is opening the hole with his right hand The corner of the scream was scared by this scream and almost jumped to the flames of the guy behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being attacked by "Steel" Maviti, he understood that he should not come out to hear the news in a real face, that would be stared by a greedy pirate Up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although most of the pirates are not strong enough to be looked at by Daniz, he is also reluctant to expose the line to the hunting "steel" Maiwei The proposed plan has a twist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What he didn’t expect was that his own meticulously changed and was exposed after an hour of going out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi’s spirit is highly tight, and he is quick to sway, and who is aiming to “greet” with the corner of his eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw the iconic seaweed-like dark blue hair, Daniz was relieved and turned to see if the players heard the other’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gambler is seriously studying the cards, or throwing or covering them, completely failing to pay attention to what happened here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come you?" Daniz asked like a random. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Alger met at the previous pirate conference, knowing that the other side has a ghost ship and a dozen sailors, is a good but not famous guy . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And according to the "Iceberg Lieutenant" judge, such a small and not too strong pirate group, can retain an ancient ghost ship, indicating that there is a big force behind Support, they may be the people of the storm church, or perhaps which pirate king, which secret organization, usually pretend to be ordinary pirates, collect the target information for the true loyalists, to facilitate the fixed point removal, and sometimes, instead The forces behind the scenes do things that they are not convenient to do, such as smashing out, for example, robbing a particular item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger pulled the chair next to him, sat down, and whispered his head. He whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that your captain got the key to 'Death' '?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz snorted with a grin:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you were still I have my own brain and I am disappointed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can such a thing be so easy to get? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want and have enough price, we will definitely sell it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" how about it? Do you want to consider this deal? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger said casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it has other secrets, maybe someone wants to deal with it Your captain. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows? Shit! "Danizi was stunned by a new round of cards. He shouted aloud.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he pressed the voice again:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The thing is not like a human creation, it may belong to a giant, or a demon. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Creation? Are your captains still insisting on teaching you words? "Alger asked a little funny.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumor "Lieutenant General Iceberg" is a woman who has a strict attitude towards knowledge. She can’t stand being a bunch of men. Illiterate, therefore, on the "Golden Dreams", there are general and reading courses every day, and the crew is forced to take turns.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz reveals a group that does not want to look back Expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is much more difficult than fighting people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of this, we always recruit enough crew members, and every time we call the port to resupply, someone will resign..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't continue this topic, looking at the dealer, he said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me pay attention to the 'steel 'The whereabouts.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steel" Maviti? The second pair of "above the blood"? Alger looked down at the "flame" Daniz's left arm, which was slightly propped up by the splint. He asked in a blank way: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it attacked by him?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For that key? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His brain has been eaten by his living corpse!" "Daniz emphasizes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to retaliate against him? "Alger guessed from the other person's tone and request.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘿嘿. "Daniz laughs and doesn't speak, looking like a new look at the cards.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger recalled the following:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your captain made his last appearance, seven days ago, near the island of Sunia. This is confirmed by a telegram. The 'Golden Dream' did not arrive in Bayam so soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a new helper? If you rely on yourself, even if there is only one person in 'Steel', you are not his opponent, and you know, He has always been surrounded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Alger’s question, Daniz’s response was to throw a chip:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it?" Alger first assumed that Daniz’s attitude was the default, holding a question There is no loss of any mentality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz stared at the board and simply replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not recognize? Those who have the strength to deal with the "steel" Maviti, whether it is a pirate or an adventurer, should have some fame on the ocean... unless it belongs to a secret organization, or is the first time to go to the sea, of course, it may be Daniz. I don't want to answer, I am afraid of revealing secrets. This is the biggest probability... I belong to an organization, I went to the sea for the first time, and I have the strength to deal with the "steel" Maviti... Alger's eyelids are slightly lifted, and there is a bold guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tapped on the edge of the table and asked in a chat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Playing in Banxi Are you happy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made an accent on the word "play". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz squinted and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that in the style of the storm church, it is impossible to blew the scandal, and the passengers of the White Onyx arrived only last night, and the people who witnessed the process actually signed The confidentiality agreement, how can the news spread so quickly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger smiled and didn't answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he deeply understood the value of the words of Russell the Great:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bold Assume, be careful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz put away the winning chips and muttered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the big deal, there are some old customs that are recovering, which led to the fall of a storm bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough...Alger laughed: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will help you pay attention to the 'Steel' whereabouts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But how can I contact you? ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm... No. 15 Xiangshu Avenue is an uninhabited house. You write the message on paper and throw it in. "Daniz hesitated to answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger nodded and stood up and patted the shoulder of "flame" Daniz:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not forget to pay. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his body and walked to the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the captain of the ghost ship Go, Daniz couldn't help but say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I have to leave here too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dare not fully believe in Alger I was afraid that after a few minutes, the other party would lead the "steel" Maviati group to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the gold coin casino, Alger wearing local wide-leg pants slowly walked down the street, entered a department store, found the corresponding counter, smiled and took a yellow Copper-colored penny road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me a tarot card."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting In the process, he dreamed of a problem:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, what is the leader of Mr. Fool? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old John Restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein watched the waiter put the plate of the grilled fish in front of him, wrapped in straw-like things, covered with what he knew, not knowing Kind of spice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong taste penetrated Klein's nose, greatly enriching the amount of his saliva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the Spice Islands... Kline is about to pick up the knife and fork, but sees the waiter put two dendrites on the plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
