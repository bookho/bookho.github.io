The link of my own thoughts and conflicts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the sudden change of "Poseidon" made him very happy, and seemed to see the original totem in the mouth of an outsider evolved toward the god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are blessed, and the rebels are blessed, the true believers are blessed... Karat blurs his head slightly, sincerely spread his hands and sticks to Mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must follow your path, like praise your name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He The blurred figure in front of the disappearance disappeared, the grand sound of the ear disappeared, and the scene inside the cave restored its original appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Karat knows that everything is no longer the same as in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved his elbows and quickly climbed back to the wheelchair, re-sitting up and going to the other side of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karate soon met Edmonton, a rebellious army with a blue-blue sea snake tattoo standing in front of a strangely bleed idol, with red and black foreheads Mixed, dirty, and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Edmonton’s expression was joyful, inspiring, and satisfying. He looked at Karat and asked: <br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you getting a god?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it is the breath of God, as before." Kara Excited nodded, "God has not only recreated the earth, but also recasted his covenant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edmonton breathed a sigh of relief:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just suspected that I had an illusion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that only outsiders are required to touch the Holy Sword, God can reproduce the earth without having to lift it up completely. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karate Affiliation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true, the current statue is broken and bleeding, Because God has changed the image, we must build new! Just follow the picture you just saw! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God also showed His sacred emblem, with a scepter shaped like a lightning bolt on the surf symbol, surrounded by the wind. Edmonton said as he recalled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karate immediately took the handrail of the wheelchair:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "We are going to the high priest now, and he should have also obtained the god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will usher in a new world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;above Klein put down the "Poseidon Scepter" and tiredly smashed his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just noticed a problem, "Poseidon Scepter" can respond to ritual magic, which is to provide a certain power to help the prayers complete the ceremony and achieve the goal. But this can only be concentrated in its own field, and can not exceed the upper limit, and the things that can be done are quite limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the goddess of the night can let the believer naturally obtain the money needed to repay the bill by affecting the fate, and the "Poseidon Scepter" is at most It is to fake the white paper on the altar to cash, and it will not be long before it will be invalidated and restored to its true appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the difference between a false god and a true God...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, in the fog In addition, as long as the process and rituals are met, 'Poseidon Scepter' is able to respond to ritual magic by itself, unless more than half of the force must be mobilized at once... This may be the very important reason for the ritual magic step...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the fog, prayers are masked and restored to light spots. "Poseidon Scepter" can no longer respond spontaneously. I have to deal with it manually, which is quite troublesome. I can't stay here all the time. Of course, this is also good. That is, as long as the prayer is correct, it accurately points to the 'Poseidon Scepter'. No matter how perfunctory the ritual steps are, you may get a response. There is only one precondition, I feel Ok...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you have time to think about it, let the 'Poseidon Scepter' become an automatic answering machine even if it is above the fog... pinch Paper angels? It’s useless, it’s not infused with the soul... to be a dull machine, to deal with repeated cumbersome ritual magic response problems? Um... I don’t know if the 'Master of Secrets' has this ability, at least Rosago only shows the characteristics of manipulating like a puppet..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Klein's thoughts gradually settled, and his eyes moved to the iron cigarette box.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After research, he found that the cigarette case with serious corrosion was really certain. Variability, stronger, stronger and more resistant to corrosion, but still within the range that normal humans can understand and accept.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no specific nature...but If you put it here for a few years, decades, or long-term special features, magical items, maybe one day, it can really evolve into a "sealing box" that will gradually fade out... Klein’s mouth is slightly moving, looking sideways To the debris in the corner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are covered by fog and are almost integrated into the surrounding.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh... Klein laughed twice and took back his sight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I played the next gold cup that was crushed and confirmed that there was no problem.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he entered the real world and summoned himself again, " Items such as the sun brooch are brought back into the hotel room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sky is cloudless, the blush is peaceful, the whole "generous city" Baia M is still sleeping in a dream.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 am, Church of the Waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger was summoned and once again in the name of the confession, he met the bishop of the parish, Jogori.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Looking for this person. "Jogori handed the portrait in his hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are tasks... What's wrong with it recently... Alger sighed in his heart, Unfolded the paper.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw the contents of the portrait, he almost couldn’t control his mouth and laughed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This painting can hardly see that it is a man or a woman. What do you look like? How do you find it? In a moment, he turned his mind and did not cover up the changes in emotions. He deliberately blurted out and debuted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is this? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portrait is an ambiguous mysterious person who does not have any features that can help find it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
