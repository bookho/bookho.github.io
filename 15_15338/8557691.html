The link of my own thoughts and conflicts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the sudden change of "Poseidon" made him very happy, and seemed to see the original totem in the mouth of an outsider evolved toward the god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are blessed, and the rebels are blessed, the true believers are blessed... Karat blurs his head slightly, sincerely spread his hands and sticks to Mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must follow your path, like praise your name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He The blurred figure in front of the disappearance disappeared, the grand sound of the ear disappeared, and the scene inside the cave restored its original appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Karat knows that everything is no longer the same as in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved his elbows and quickly climbed back to the wheelchair, re-sitting up and going to the other side of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karate soon met Edmonton, a rebellious army with a blue-blue sea snake tattoo standing in front of a strangely bleed idol, with red and black foreheads Mixed, dirty, and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Edmonton’s expression was joyful, inspiring, and satisfying. He looked at Karat and asked: <br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you getting a god?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it is the breath of God, as before." Kara Excited nodded, "God has not only recreated the earth, but also recasted his covenant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edmonton breathed a sigh of relief:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just suspected that I had an illusion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that only outsiders are required to touch the Holy Sword, God can reproduce the earth without having to lift it up completely. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karate Affiliation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true, the current statue is broken and bleeding, Because God has changed the image, we must build new! Just follow the picture you just saw! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God also showed His sacred emblem, with a scepter shaped like a lightning bolt on the surf symbol, surrounded by the wind. Edmonton said as he recalled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are going to the high priest now, and he should have also obtained the oracle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will usher in a new world! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, Klein puts down the "Poseidon Scepter" He tiredly licked his forehead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just noticed a problem, "Poseidon Scepter" can respond to ritual magic, that is, provide some strength, help The prayers complete the ceremony and achieve the goal, but this can only be concentrated in its own field, and cannot exceed the upper limit. The things that can be done are quite limited.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, The goddess of the night can let the believer naturally obtain the money needed to repay the bill by influencing the fate, and the "Poseidon Scepter" at most is to fake the white paper on the altar to cash, and it will not expire after a long time. It's a real look.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the difference between a false god and a true god...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Moreover, in addition to the fog, as long as the process and the ritual are met, the 'Poseidon Scepter' can respond to the ritual magic by itself unless it is necessary Sexually mobilize more than half of the power... This may be the very important reason for the steps of ritual magic...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the fog, prayer is masked and restored Light spot, "Poseidon Scepter" can no longer respond spontaneously, I have to deal with it manually, this is quite troublesome, I can't stay here all the time, of course, this is also good, that is, as long as the prayer is correct, it points to the ' The Poseidon Scepter's, regardless of how perfunctory the ritual steps are, may be responded to. There is only one precondition, I am in a good mood...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you have time to think about it The way, let the 'Poseidon Scepter' become an automatic answering machine even if it is above the fog... pinching a paper angel? Useless, no injecting soul... doing a rigid mechanical shackle, dealing with repeated tedious martial arts Responding to the problem? Um... I don’t know if the 'Master of Secrets' has this ability, at least Rosago only shows the characteristics of manipulating like a puppet..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s thoughts gradually sink , The iron gaze moved on cigarette packs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After research, he found that the cigarette case with serious corrosion was really different, more firm and stronger, and more resistant to corrosion, but still normal. Humans can understand and accept within the scope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no specific nature...but if you put it here for a few years, decades, or long-term special features, magical items, maybe one day, It can really evolve into a "sealing box" where the effect will gradually disappear... Kline's mouth is slightly moving, looking sideways at the debris piled up in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are covered by fog and are almost integrated into the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh... Klein laughed twice and took back his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He played the next crushed gold goblet and confirmed that there was no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he entered the real world, summoned himself again, and brought items such as "sun brooch" back into the hotel room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the high-altitude cloud disappears, the blush is peaceful, and the whole "generous city" Baiyam is still sleeping in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 am, Wave Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger was summoned and once again in the name of the confession, met the parish bishop Jogori. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for this person." Jogori handed the portrait in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are tasks... What's wrong with this recently... Alger sighed in his heart and unfolded the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he looked at the contents of the portrait, he almost couldn’t control his mouth and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This painting can hardly see that it is a man or a woman. What do you look like? In an instant, he thought about a turn, did not cover up the changes in mood, deliberately blurted out and debut:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
