			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, Klein, who was full of food, sat leisurely on the sofa in the living room and cut the letter sent by the instructor with a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Melissa sat at the table, with the light of the gas lamp, painstakingly calculating the exercises in the book, Benson was on the single sofa. Holding the "Primary Accounting Course" to read. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a three-page letter, Klein looked forward and looked at the past with some fear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"...I am very happy to hear from you, which makes me miss the life of the past few years. Unfortunately, Welch and Naya have left us forever..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I participated in their funeral and felt the great sorrow of their parents. These are two young people who should have a brilliant future..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fate is always unpredictable. No one knows what the next moment is on us. The older I have, the more things I have seen, the more I can feel as human beings. Fragile and helpless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...For the historical information about the main peak of Hornachs you mentioned, I remember the archaeologist John Joseph Mr. has published a monograph detailing his knowledge of the main peak of the Hornacs Mountains. He discovered several ancient buildings, more than one today. More than a thousand years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let every historian and archaeologist feel ashamed that we lack the means to pinpoint the age, only according to the architecture Style, the characteristics of murals, and a small amount of recognizable text to make a rough judgment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's hard to believe that on such a high mountain, there will be Human settlements. Mr. Joseph has sufficient evidence to show that those human beings have developed their own civilizations and unique civilizations. The specific situation is difficult to describe clearly in the letter. I suggest that you try to go to the Devil Library. I can't borrow that monograph. Believe me, the library donated by Sir Deville has more books than the one set up by the city government."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The name of this monograph is "The Study of the Ancient Relics of the Main Peak of Hornachus", published by the Lun People Publishing House."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, there are some papers mentioned Relevant information, they are separately published in the "New Archaeological" "Archaeology Review" On, the specific name and issue number are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein one word After the words were read, the monographs and the names of the papers mentioned by the instructors were repeated and meditation several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he flipped out the stationery, found the pen, and expressed his gratitude in written language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melissa, you will send me this letter tomorrow, this is the postage." Klein put the installed letter and the excess postage on the sister's book. Next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa glanced at it and snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein, postage You don't need that much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, postage doesn't need so much, but girls need a certain amount of pocket money." Kline smiled and replied, "I I think Selena should have told you this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that Melissa had some resistance, and he added:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can help you buy the materials you want, the tools you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tools..." Melissa Repeated it in a low voice, his eyes moved to the book, and he nodded invisibly. "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s mouth was suddenly upturned, and his pace was brisk. Walked back to the sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Awesome persuasion, accurately found the weakness of Melissa." Benson erected his thumb and lowered his voice and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein cleared his throat and answered it in a serious way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I should convince you What? The focus of your self-study should be on grammar and classical literature. Of course, basic mathematics and logic are equally important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the curriculum of the public school and grammar school, according to the content of the university entrance examination, Klein can almost grasp the general direction of the "civil service examination" that has not yet been born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson touched his hairline and laughed at himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In those In front of the books, I feel like a curler."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But they are really useful enough." Klein smiled firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Melissa put down the pen, stood up and went to the sofa position:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Banson, Klein, this Sunday is the birthday of Selena. She and her parents want to invite our family to the dinner. Are you free?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should have no problem." Klein thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can also meet my sister’s friends, so that I don’t know what to do in the future! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me too." Benson combed his hair with his fingers. "It seems that we have to consider giving Miss Selena a birthday present." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This matter was handed over to Melissa, she was We know more about Miss Selina, and what we need to do is what a gentleman should do and pay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first time I heard someone The lazy description is so beautiful." Banson shook his head and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein returns with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the role of grammar and classical literature." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Banson didn't expect the topic to come back again, and he couldn't find a language response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Klein wore the original cheap suit. Carrying a black silver-plated cane, step by step up the stairs to the door of the Black Thorns Security Company - his tuxedo has been sent to the lock shop to mend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is planning to say hello to Roshan, and suddenly saw Captain Dunn coming out of the partition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Klein, did you sleep well last night?" Dunn asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein replied truthfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before I imagined, there was no nightmare, It’s just a little heavy, some disgusting when I remember.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Very good, I can rest assured.” Dunn smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chatted again, he took the initiative to mention:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church has replied to me The telegram, let Ayr and Lorotta immediately sent the seal '2-049' to the Beckland with the notes of the Antigonus family, and sent another night man to take the steam train yesterday afternoon. Help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, they should have already set off now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has already set off ? Does that mean that I completely get rid of the shadow of the Antignus family notes? Klein groaned, and there was something that was not real enough to seem to be dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a lot easier than I thought...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be no follow-up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the goddess bless them, and let them go all the way." After a few seconds, Klein painted a red moon on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den wears a hat and points out the door:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to go to the patrol Phil's cemetery, oh, forget one thing. Leonard and the police department have made some achievements in the tracing of the members of the secret society. They found the coachmen who carried them and confirmed their temporary residence in Tingen. Point, but they are quite cautious and leave no particularly valuable clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s an old secret organization.” Kline’s feelings echoed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn nodded and turned to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three seconds, he stopped and went back: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, you To become a full-time member application, the church may take two to three days to respond. Oh, this and the Antignus family notes belong to different departments, and the efficiency is not the same."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Klein replied in good faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he helped the captain silently add one thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember today Submit a reimbursement request! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Dunn was gone, Klein heard the surprised voice of the brown-haired girl Roshan:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Goddess, Klein, are you going to be a full member? I remember you have been in us for less than a month!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After I took the 'Divination' potion, this is definitely going to happen."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It makes sense..." Luo Shan stayed for a few seconds and suddenly lamented, "I still pray that you will complete the occult course as soon as possible and join the list of the arsenal of the arbitrage. As a result... Goddess, every I will be worth a night in two days, I am not a sleepless person! My skin, my state, goddess, save me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not Should I be used to this kind of life? Before I joined, it was always you and Bright and the old Neil took turns?” Klein asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosanne shook his head in grief:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it was four before, earlier It is five, but unfortunately, Cohenli chose to become a 'sleepless person'. Viola did not renew the contract last month and joined the Hoynoor Machinery Company. She is a very talented girl, just lacking opportunities and Money, and the five-year civil service life gave her enough accumulation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Luo Shan suddenly saw Klein, covering his mouth and laughing. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think of a good idea, Klein, get married as soon as possible, and then accidentally expose the secrets of the extraordinary to her, which is very slight There is no particularly serious punishment for leaking secrets. After all, no one can hide the person who sleeps with a bed for a long time. At that time, you can introduce her to join us and become a civilian staff! The perfect plan!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's mouth micro-motion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Luoshan, It is also easier to find a husband as soon as possible. I believe that you have enough means to reveal the secret to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roshan heard the words, eyes rounded Half-mouthed, said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can this be? Marriage is a very serious matter that must be carefully observed, carefully selected, and used for a certain period of time. To verify."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You just didn't say that... Klein didn't reason with Miss Rosanne, smiled and sighed a few words, and left the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came to the arsenal, he saw that Neil was tossing the coffee, so he sat down and waited patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should be a full member soon?" Old Neil side filtered and asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The captain said it will take two to three days, and I don't know if the church will approve." Kline answered calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." Old Neil laughed. "This kind of thing, the church will not be vetoed, especially if you have become extraordinary."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he turned his head and smiled at Klein Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to do Well prepared, every official member of the night must pass a ceremony, that is, to complete a task independently. Of course, Dunn will definitely choose a very easy and very simple kind for the newcomer, and you are still an auxiliary diviner. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
