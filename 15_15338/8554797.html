			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identified! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was shocked and almost directly entered the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he did not open the vision, he could confirm from the voice and words of Emlin White that he did not lie, he is very confident, he is very determined! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of tightness just started, and Klein suddenly thought of a question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I why Want to worry about this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he answered his question in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recognized it, and the situation is different now than it was two months ago! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to be in front of the official monitor, because of the horror of Ambassador Becker, running around, trying to grasp every straw, in the process, I was exposed Extraordinary circles, even those who become extraordinary, are indispensable, so even if the extraordinary person is exposed, they will not think too deeply and dig out my past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the high probability of Essinger Stanton’s detective is extraordinary, and maintains a good relationship with the police and official organizations. He had vague speculation before. I am the same kind, and gently draw me up. From this point of view, I am barely an official peripheral member. If something really happens, it will not necessarily be caught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, I have already made the current image deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. I am not afraid of the order on the photo. Once the situation is wrong, I can directly abandon Minsk Street 15 and Sherlock Moriatti this identity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what do I have to worry about? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, before I came, I also had divination, and the revelation was almost non-existent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, Klein’s shrinking pupil, slightly changed face, and ready-to-go state are all relaxed, just as the other is talking about today’s weather. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing him as usual, Emlin White raised his eyebrows and walked a few steps, squeezing from his front and slowly sitting next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vampire looks at the Utravsky bishop who leads the believer in the communion, and sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Detective, are you not afraid that I will go to the police station and yell that you are extraordinary?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein also looked ahead, No turning: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will follow you and yell that this is a vampire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Come on, hurt each other! Who is afraid of who! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White’s expression stiffened and erected his right index finger:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blood family, noble blood family! Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for Klein to open, see that Uttrasky is focusing on the Eucharist, Emlin. White laughed a little: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, I am finally free.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I pretend to give in, telling the old man that I am willing to convert to the Mother Earth, and deeply regret the actions of the past. Although I don't know what I need to regret, I still have no problem." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old man turned out to believe this, and he was very happy. Let me out on the spot, let me be a priest here, tell me if I can finish it. The Holy Scriptures of the Mother Earth Church let me go home.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, this old guy who is full of muscles and believes in silly, really Good deception! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheat? Klein looked at the smug vampire and looked forward:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Seeing Emlin White, looking unbelief, wanting to refute, he rubbed the top of his cane and made a casual addition:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The priest has a strong hand The seal, called the 'heart candle', allows the holder to enter the deepest part of the target's mind, where no one can lie.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is just one of its functions, it has no other ability, I don't know. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin gradually stopped, his eyes slowly lost focus.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty In a few seconds, he whispered palely: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I said that I was willing to change the letter, the old man came up with a lantern and there was a lantern inside. I cut the candle, I didn't look at what the candle looked like..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned over his head and looked at Emlin White with pity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Uttraski may use it to plant a hint for you to gradually and thoroughly believe in the Mother Earth. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin twitched his mouth to reveal a smile comparable to a living corpse:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I have no feeling at all, it should not be what you said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, my parents are not coming soon? They can blame the priest through ordinary people, saying that he forcibly detained me and made him in the Mother Earth Church. The choice between the reputation and letting me go <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this method great? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein maintains a sympathetic look, clasps his hands, and reaches the front of his mouth, making a serious remorse:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I am Father Uttraski, I will choose the police and let the police clarify the facts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said that the last loss would be a bishop with legal missionary qualifications, or a vampire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"...Blood, blood!" Emlin White's facial muscles seem to appear paralyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabs his fist and rubs the back of the chair:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can wait, When I am carrying the Holy Scriptures, I ask the old man to let me go back! He is a truly sincere person and will not fail to keep his promise!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not turn around, I laughed a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been to River Bay Avenue 48, your parents have moved."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inevitably, they will not only move, but will also move to places I don't know." Emlin White did not hesitate to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's tone is quite easy to add:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They moved too fast, a lot Nothing is taken away, for example, those in your room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White's expression suddenly became very exciting, his mouth was open, Suddenly stood up and squeezed out from Klein, rushing to the Utravsky bishop in front of the life emblem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, bishop, I want to go home, I want to go home, I want to go home!" Emlin shouted loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See also the believer did not complete the communion ceremony, Father Uttraski did not respond, just calmly looked at the poor vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin Hoor closed his mouth and became quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squats back and forth, looking anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and got up, took a cane and hat, and walked along the aisle to the front row of the church prayer hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop, I don't know why you let Emlin stay here, I don't want to know, I only know one thing, his parents entrusted me to take him back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this giant-like priest easily agrees to my request, it can only wax for the vampire Emlin, no, from today, he must hate the candle, or silently... Ryan thought to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr. Uttraski looked down at them and replied softly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Emlin can go home at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein looked at Emlin White. He raised his right hand and clicked on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to clock four times into a red moon, but in the end he forcibly painted the triangle emblem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin was quite uneasy by him, and did not say anything, rushed directly to the church door and left here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not slow to follow his side, no hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a trot, Emlin suddenly slowed down and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I feel that I am beginning to miss the harvest church, I miss the feeling of reciting the Holy Scriptures, I miss the life emblem, I want to do the cleaning and cleaning up, just do it for an hour, an hour..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suggests that it is more "virulent" than I thought. No matter where the vampire went, every day I have to go back to the harvest church report and force labor for an hour? In fact, okay, at least not forcibly changing the faith of Emlin with implied methods, but still respect him. Why should I use the word "respect"... The candle is called "heart" and is said to come from a dragon. The "audience" approach is a bit scary... Kline points to the cane: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need me to remind me?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no," Emmlin said with a distorted expression, and said with an angry tone, "I will fight this feeling! I have to move to the sea and move to Fossac. I don't believe it." Beckland, I will still want to come back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bit his teeth and suddenly vomited:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"We took the carriage back to the River Bay Avenue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Klein did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few steps away, Emlin stopped a rental carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was about to log in, his back was stiff for two seconds, and then he was very whispered, almost letting Klein hear it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no money on my body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have." Klein smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin stopped talking and entered the carriage. Klein sat across from him, and after the carriage began to drive, he asked as if thinking: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your father is a physician? Has an excellent level of pharmacy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin though Not slouched, but still habitually raised the chin:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the talent of our blood family. The best of the potions masters are blood!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way..." Klein whispered, wondering what he was thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin was silent for a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember to write to your friends, Tell him that I have returned to River Bay Avenue and my parents will come to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Klein replied succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
