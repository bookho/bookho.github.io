			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz, who couldn’t stand this scene, decided to do something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coughed twice, to "The Iceberg Lieutenant" Edwina Edwards: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Captain, Mr. Gilman Spallo wants to ask you some questions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein quietly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you continue to fight, he will be set up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edvina’s action was very slight, and looked at Klein Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Sparo, have you received any education?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the problem? Klein's expression is unchanged, and the indifference responds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Graduate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? Daniz looked at German Sparrow and couldn't believe that this crazy adventurer, bounty hunter actually went to college, and graduated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no way to connect the university of knowledge with Galman Sparo! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless "Hunter University", "killer college"... or a university that only exists in the mad, mental patient delusion...Daniz can't help but belly Two sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina is not unusual, continue to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What languages ​​are you in control?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein resists the frowning impulse:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Giant, Elvish, Dragon, Ancient Hermes, Hermes, Gussack, Lun..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aide Wenna "Hmm" :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know anything about other areas of occultism?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;恍恍惚惚,克Ryan seems to have returned to the primary school primary school, because the age is almost, the teacher has tested a series of questions, how many Chinese characters have been mastered, what has been learned four arithmetic, what do you know English letters, what can count the number of Tang poems... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm... You are now Gelman Sparrow... Klein once again expressionlessly:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Proficient."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina thought for two seconds, and the speed of speech was not slow to explain: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must consider your level of knowledge to consider How to answer questions so that you can understand them more easily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...Kline is shocked to see that the beautiful lady in front of me is totally unlike the adventure of part-time pirates. The home is simply a teacher with a cold expression but a good attitude and a good attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about the vampire who ran the Mother Church every day, he calmed down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first pirate general I have officially known, and it has its own characteristics... Klein secretly sighed and said:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first question, where the extraordinary creatures on the sea are infested? See you very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not directly ask the mermaid The news, so as not to be ridiculed by the "Iceberg Lieutenant" to see their true purpose, thus bringing unnecessary surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina thought about it and wiped off the "departure ceremony" on the blackboard, even the tape wrote:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the island of Sunia, sailing 1200 nautical miles here will go deep into the seas that humans have not officially explored.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edwina talked about it, partly because she found it on her own treasure, partly because of the exchange of knowledge and rumors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a while for her to finish, but what made Klein frustrated was that there was no mermaid in the rest of the waters of the eastern side of the Gargas Islands. legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly adjusted his mood and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second question, do you know What is the way to remove mental pollution from extraordinary characteristics?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hide what he knew about extraordinary characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina’s first flash of twilight seemed to re-recognize German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I have had an idea to use the power of the outside to completely smash the extraordinary characteristics of pollution and restore it to the tiniest spot, so that regardless of pollution or curse, All will be dissipated because of the loss of the carrier, or disappear quickly or slowly, and the extraordinary characteristics of being crushed will be based on a certain trait of its own, a little bit of polymerization, and re-formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, only the gods can do this kind of thing. If you get the care of a god, you can try to please Him and give enough The sacrifices, pray for a response."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law of extraordinary characteristic aggregation... Klein filled in the heart of things that Edwina deliberately did not mention. At the same time, he had to feel that the captain of the "Iceberg Lieutenant" and "Golden Dream" had a profound knowledge of occultism and was no better than seeing it. Many Russell diaries have experienced many things and learned a lot about their own secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumored "Iceberger" can replicate or simulate the extraordinary ability that opponents have used in front of her... this and Mr. Essinger Stanton's "2 The -081" ring is very similar... Klein's thoughts just got out of the way, he was forcibly pulled back by himself, as if he was thinking about something and nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I agree with this hypothesis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, without practice, it can only be imagined." Edwina rarely used emotions. word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniel, who has been listening for a while, has been sluggish and can’t keep up with the rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are they talking about? What are they discussing? Why do I know each word, I don’t understand what it means when I combine it... What is the extraordinary feature? What is the situation of smashing? What does aggregation mean? Daniz looked left and right, his eyes filled with stunned eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein threw out the third question that he had thought about:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where Is there an ancient grievance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only mentions this kind of monster, because the corresponding material can obviously be used in the field of the dead, without revealing its own sequence secrets. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina looked at Daniz and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will help you pay attention <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to attend the extraordinary party of Bayam, he knows something and can take you there. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, talking to smart people is easy... Klein added: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Do you know where there are people who can make amazing things with extraordinary materials or features? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I met in the party, but he did not appear again. Edwina replied calmly. "I have the knowledge to simulate the attempt, but I don't guarantee the success rate." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh... then I will wait for the first time... Klein no longer struggles with this topic, and instead asks:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand." Edwina suddenly showed a black and black key in her hand. It was as big as a lyre, old in shape and dull in color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pirate general holds the shipwreck relics half-half:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are Say this key, I can tell you with certainty that it belongs to the giant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at Daniz:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your sailor tells me that it may also belong to a dragon or a demon wolf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the earliest guess, I recently found some historical documents, combined with other items on board, and initially had a definitive answer.” Edwina was not at all annoyed, full of patience, but her expression was still cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz finally recovered the presence of the dream owner, curiously asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Captain, is it really a giant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Edwina gave a positive answer, "The batch of documents showed that during the Quaternary, There are still many giants active, some have converted to God of War, and some have been scattered around the country, becoming the target of human hunting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of the tribes, building ships, trying to go out to sea The lost giant Wang Ting has never returned. The shipwrecks and some of the items we found are very similar to the antiquities they left in the original settlements. Therefore, we have enough reason to believe that the key belongs to the giant and is likely Pointing to the family they lost before the Cataclysm. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant Wang Ting? The little "Sun" said that it was not far from their Silver City... Klein did not speak, quietly listened to "Iceberg Lieutenant "The description." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had to say that "the city of silver" and "the land of God" is something that my knowledge field has overcome other extraordinary people... well, Even the seven true gods can't find it there at the moment, and it's hard to figure out the specific situation. On this point, I am stronger than them... Klein is half-satisfied and thinks about it. He speaks quietly:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I pay a price, are you willing to sell this key? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, unless I have another clue to the giant Wang Ting." "A De Wenna is still a fast and unhurried speed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very good, if one day Tarot will organize the Giants Wang Ting Exploration Mission, I will buy This key... Klein wanted to say the last question, and suddenly remembered the four adventurers he had encountered before.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used the "dream charm" "The power of a woman with blue-gray eyes, a male shirt, and her three companions:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know them? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina glanced at it and said nothing about the process:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ticia Dorilla, an archaeologist and adventurer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is rumored that she is a member of the 'Moss Hardship Society' or 'Elements of Dawn'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Moss accompaniment society" ... the ancient organization that believes in "hiding the sage"... It is not for money, the purpose is definitely to abandon something in the temple... Klein asked casually: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you know about 'Element Dawn'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mysterious organization and "mental alchemy society" Similarly, birth is one or two hundred years, combining the elements of various occult genres. There is a set of his own theories. Members are good at casting spells and mastering many ancient witchcraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina licked her lips:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have been fighting against Moss The Assassination Society'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rumor is that the eldest daughter of Russell the Great, Bernard Gustav. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
