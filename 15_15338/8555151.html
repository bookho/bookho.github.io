			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the real world, Firth sat at his desk and thought for a moment about the Abraham family, referring to those esoteric notes. There is a new understanding of the words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out to be like this... No wonder Mrs. Anlisa is unwilling to tell Mr. Lawrence about her husband and her own death... Think about it, the Abraham family is really pitiful. And sad... Fols said a few words, and turned out the "Spirit of the World" from a pile of ordinary miscellaneous books, ready to transcribe the first and second chapters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, she meditates and adjusts her breathing so that she can be in the best state. Otherwise, she will only copy the contents of "Spiritual World". Bringing her to mania and chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words clearly have no spirituality, but once combined to describe those ridiculous scenes, it seems to have the ability to influence people's emotions... every five minutes of transcription After five minutes of rest, I don't want to get out of control... Fols took out a small and exquisite pocket watch and placed it on the desk in front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BMW City, Berg Home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick woke up, his eyes lit up with lightning reflections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and didn't feel like he was being monitored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the "inverted" accurate reasoning and calm attitude towards the previous event, let Dairik believe that his guess is certainly not wrong, I believe this moment There must be someone or some extraordinary person with special ability to peep into the secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, Mr. ‘fool’ did not deny...” Dairik rolled out of bed and habitually moved his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, some analysis and suggestions for "downside down" appeared in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Until now, no one has been looking for you, not to put you in the dungeon, which means that your 'chief' and the rest of the 'six-members' elders are more inclined to observe, hoping from more than two thousand The first living person I met in the past, Amon, found a way to get the entire Silver City out of the abandoned land.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, you didn't do anything too bad Under the premise, they will certainly not rashly alarm you, lest Amon find abnormalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this way, their monitoring will not be too close, at least not too close when you are awake.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of this, they have no chance to find out that you have coughed out the 'bugs', and their subsequent reactions have indirectly proved this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The same, they should only observe what ritual you are holding, but you can't figure out who you are praying for, change to be me, definitely I suspect that this is related to Amon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the above reasons, you can complete the ritual of the request and give it to Amon afterwards. Of course, you must Be cautious enough and be careful, and be prepared to accept the extraordinary examinations of different sequences such as 'mental analysts' after the end. In this case, you can pray for 'Mr. Fool' to help...”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the suggestion of "downside down", after taking two laps around the table, Dairik carefully closed the window, lit the candle, and arranged the ritual requested. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, in the old palace.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is watching the pillars supporting the dome, and feels this according to their own ideas. The building is quite like the Temple of Athens.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because of my own subconscious mind? His thoughts are divergent thoughts.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the dark red stars corresponding to the "sun" shine brightly, and they quickly sway open, condensing an illusory mysterious door, and a little power is shaken above the entire fog. As the water lingers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the layers of prayers, Klein lowered his head and looked at the "black eye" that was placed in front of him. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that the little 'sun' will not lose it, otherwise the 'world' can only sacrifice with the heroic..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Because there is a “black eye”, it is not a “secret master” Klein can secretly manipulate the dummy “world” and let him behave in a flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you lose this item, in order to avoid "magic" wear, he can only let the "world" die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the emotion, Klein spread spirituality, driving the raging fogging force to the illusory door, pushing a gap and stabilizing The channel of the transmission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he put the "Eye of All Black" into a tin box and threw it into the gap of the mysterious gate, which was like a casual saying. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not touch the items inside directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing all this, he didn't Too much to stop because he knows that the little "Sun" is not so quick to find an action, because he does not know when the "Magician" will be able to transcribe two chapters of "Spiritual Insights". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spiritual stretch, Klein's figure disappeared on the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BMW City, Berg Home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric just saw an iron black box on the altar and heard the familiar voice of Mr. Fool:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not touch the items inside directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not touch directly...Dairick honestly wrote this reminder , decided not to perform a little discount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for the "fool" and "world", ending the request for the ceremony, he opened the iron box with great care and examined the contents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a dark eye without a pupil, just seeing it, let Dairik have a mental confusion, a slow feeling of thinking, his The ear is even more faint, not real enough, it seems a little crazy slang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; violently shuddered, Dairik closed the iron box lid, picked up the sterling silver dagger, and made the "spiritual wall" way to iron The box is completely closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he put the iron box in the pocket on the inside of the clothing, don't go to the "Hurricane Axe", go out and go straight to the training ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The isolation of the squad members has not yet disguised. However, Dairik did not think about acting today. He would follow the instructions of Mr. Of course, if you have a good opportunity, you must take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the training ground, Dairik circled around the area where the exploration team was located, and saw that they were gathering together in twos and threes, whispering something, but Once someone is seen, they stop immediately, standing there silently, and sometimes taking a few steps, as if they had just climbed out of the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I lift the "wall of spirituality" now, let the feelings of Mr. "World" spread out, what will they react to? At the same time, turn your head and look at me together? Dairik imagined that someone in the place brushed his head and looked at his scene indifferently, and he had some inexplicable fears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a breath and told himself to be patient, to wait, not to panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver City, at the top of the round tower, belonging to the "chief" room . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Demon Hunter" who closed his eyes and regained his spirits, Colin Iliat slammed his eyes and looked at the dark corners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure twisted from where it stood up, swaying slightly, rubbing the same singer with metal:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Chief', De Rick Berg has held another ceremony. According to my observation, it should be the ritual requested, which is similar to the usual sacrifice ceremony, but different Yes, he got a response and was given an iron black box.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is nothing inside, I can't see it, but it is very evil. A very dangerous feeling. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
