			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slight tremor on the surface, a figure nearly three meters high appeared on the edge of the island's primeval forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is grayish white and seems to consist of a block of boulder, with a pitted face and no obvious eyes, nose, mouth and ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stone Giant..." "Star above" Jia Delia whispered the type of monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And regardless of Klein, or Anderson, there is no understanding of this monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, they did not cast a look at the eyes of Jia Delia, staring at the monsters intently, a look of my professionalism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia De Li Ya turned his body and faced the "Future No." on the side stop, half-lifting his right hand and amplifying the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aiming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirates on duty on the ship immediately adjusted the orientation of dozens of artillery on the port side, letting them all aim heavy The stone giant who came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! Bang! Bang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One piece of artillery shell flew out and landed around the stone giant, and the dust instantly swelled, covering a large area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the obvious tremors of the earth, the fire lingers and the fragments splatter, as if to destroy everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray-and-white figure passed through the smoke and was not seriously hurt, but the surface cracked a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The star above will" said Gardelia: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a giant One is a stone monster.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The core of it is the main material of the 'God of War' route sequence 5 'Guardian', so the defense is very high. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the reverberating cannon, Klein almost suspected that his hearing had a problem.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since you understand the strengths of the Stone Giant, why do you want to fire a gun? Isn't this a waste of shells? He is half-confident and half-thinking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps he heard his voice, and Jia Delia looked at the stone giant who was approaching step by step:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never encountered such extraordinary creatures before, so I want to do the test. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced for this reason... Klein can't speak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Anderson Hood, who has been watching the Stone Giant, raised his hand: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who do you have the extraordinary ability in the field of frost? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I. "The star above will" Jia Delia calmly replied.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See the "hidden" lady has a way, Klein will come to the mouth to swallow the words <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, it is not necessary, I really don’t want to open the “squirming hunger”, although the “live corpse” does have the ability to control the frost.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- On this island, he estimates that he can't find the right food!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia Delia from the wizard In the pocket of the robe, a gray-black scroll was taken out, and a Guhemian word was whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ice! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the scroll was swallowed up by the ice blue flame, and the crystal clear stream of light was in the air.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the squeaky sound, the ice layer broke down one after another, and the stone giant slowly walked out of the area. However, its appearance was darker and darker, and the movement was the earliest and stiffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Anderson lifted his hands up as if the conductor was applauding the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone giant's sole instantly ignited the flame of orange near white, just as it stepped on a trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of the surface quickly ignited a burst of water vapor, then cracked and cracked, and there was another deep gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson’s right arm was pulled back and the palm of his hand condensed a flaming rifle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame of the gun tip is shrunk to a point, and the brilliance of the glare is shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rifle flew out, accurately hit the crack in the stone giant's abdomen, where it directly burned a big hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson Hood, who was originally on the beach, seems to have merged with the blazing rifle as soon as possible. When the fire is shining, he appears strangely behind the stone giant. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a fist in his left hand, his arm bulged, and a hook on the hook from the big hole into the heart of the stone giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seemingly simple attack creates an exaggerated effect, and the stone giant immediately stiffens in place, and the interior is constantly bursting, causing a few seconds. It collapsed into a pile of gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely fatal attack... Kline’s gaze narrowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The star above the" Caldera calmly stood in the same place, without any surprise: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The sequence of the 'hunter' route is called 'Reaper'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And they are good at discovering the weaknesses of prey. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reaper"...harvesting life? No wonder... Kline’s position is very small.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Anderson squatted and squatted in the wreckage of the Stone Giant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he turned his head and smiled bitterly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a real monster. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, no gain!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson describes the situation, the pile of gravel also It disappeared at a speed visible to the naked eye.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......You don’t want to open the box to touch the body... Klein couldn’t help but vomit in his heart. One sentence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson returned and couldn’t stop talking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sea area The biggest problem is this, not every monster can provide you with wealth! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this emerging monster is part of a higher and more powerful monster, of course, it may also be the residual remnant of the residual power... Klein I have long been judged.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this time of sailing, he discovered that there are extraordinary ways of "sun", "night", "storm" and "audience" Traces, there are more specific guesses about some of the previous ideas.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally suspected that this sea area is the battlefield left by the ancient gods of the Second Age: "Storm "Belongs to the Elf King Sonia Sorem, "The Spectator" belongs to the Dragon King Angel Weide, "The Dark Night" belongs to the Destroyed Wolf Wolf Fregra - along with the small "Sun" to provide the mythical record of the Silver City Klein has preliminarily grasped the respective powers of the eight ancient gods of the Second Age.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is always in the noon day and the gold cast The Sun Chariot" made Klein’s judgment on his own, because of the eight There is no God, grasp a "sun" approach <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;After the creator regained consciousness, after repeated fierce battles, the authority of the ancient gods was taken back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving such a ruin of war? Klein’s mind revealed the incomplete murals seen in the remains of the ancient elves:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf King Sonia Sorem is working with the Silver City Creator, too It is the ancient sun god confrontation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a lot of thoughts, and Anderson has recovered his laughing state and looked at him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What is the name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German Sparo." Klein simply gave a name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German Sparo?" Anderson first glimpsed, immediately normal, "I heard you, almost hunted the 'disease lieutenant' adventure Home, the title of the craziest hunter! When I took the boat through the Rothde Islands and Olavy Island last month, I was going to find you a glass of wine and get to know each other. As a result, you didn't know where to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month? I volunteered at the hospital... Klein nodded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"now I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "And, try not to talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Anderson forcibly smiled, "I know, my bad luck will make me bad. The words are fulfilled, well, don't look at me, I won't say it, you can put down your spells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is a monster like Stone Giant, The relaxation time of the pirates was shortened, and the “Future” quickly re-launched and made its way into the depths of the ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, Klein stood on the deck and leaned against the ship's side to observe the situation around him, while Anderson strolled around the boat, very good at communication and pirates. They communicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, it’s easy to figure out what’s going on on the boat... Klein’s eye-catching Anderson, who is drinking with a few pirates in the shadow of the cabin, sincerely Sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the "strongest hunter" probably didn't know that there was something sedative in his drink that didn't know what it was... Klein held back his smile. Think narrowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of Anderson, the "Future" successfully bypassed two hidden vortexes and a palace remnant floating on the sea, continuing to follow the safe channel . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three hours, the night is coming again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quickly recovered his sobriety and reason in his dreams and stared at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His vision is dark and nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......I won’t be jealous... Klein’s conditional reflections came out like this, then, the right palm was swallowed into the pocket and taken out. A box of matches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a must-have for the Magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After picking up a match and brushing it, Klein immediately showed a faint flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames struggled to expand and blur the surrounding scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a cell, the cell of the iron fence gate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I be here? It’s not the “star above”, nor the wall painting hall where Anderson is located... a random range within a certain range? As the thoughts turned, Klein took a hand and extinguished the match that almost burned his finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His left palm was quickly dyed with a layer of pure and bright sunshine, and there seemed to be two more rounds of "sun" in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the soul of the "Light Priest", he acquired the ability of night vision belonging to the "Sacred Light". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
