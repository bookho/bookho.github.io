			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missing "Justice" is always able to maintain a happy mood, it is really enviable, I hope I can do the same... I heard the brisk greeting, the end Klein, who was sitting on the bronze long table, couldn’t help but feel a silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he immediately thought that the other person would simply take out 1,000 pounds of cash, and suddenly felt that he would always like to be happy as a "just" lady. It is very difficult...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik Berg is a teenager who cares a lot about his reputation and immediately replies:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have obtained the recipe for 'Readers'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he organized his parents to stay Under the house, in addition to the house, furniture and a few items used to miss, the rest of the valuable things were taken to the "black market" of the Silver City, in exchange for the "reader" formula and "singer" "The potion material is currently only based on a fixed amount of food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he believes that this situation will not last long, and when he passes the battle assessment, he will join the team to clean up the surrounding "dark things" and get a lot of money. Remuneration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When really strong, I applied to become a member of the elite team, explore the depths of the dark, find ways to lift the curse... Dairik is implicitly hopeful Thinking, looking sideways at the "fool" in the thick fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He last noticed that Miss "Justice" was able to strangely let the unknown Russell Diary appear directly after asking Mr. "The Fool"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Dairik does not understand what is going on, he feels it is better to take a look at Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You first recall the recipe in your head, then pick up the pen at hand and give a strong desire to express." Klein looks like a leisurely backrest on the back of the chair. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the "sun" comes from the silver city suspected of "the land of God's abandonment," he is not a pen but a feather pen in front of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is still no ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick did not dare to doubt the words of the fool, and immediately grasped the feather pen that suddenly appeared at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, according to the instructions, he did not accidentally see the "Reader" potion on the yellow-brown parchment in front of him. formula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examined twice, Dairik kept silent and pushed the promised thing to Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey was excited, excited, and looking forward to it, but he took it with great restraint and looked at the words that Klein translated into his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Main material: the complete pituitary of the Phantom Yalong, 10 ml of the spinal fluid of the semi-phantom rabbit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Auxiliary materials..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main material that I have never heard of... Well, I don’t know enough... I’ve been from Foss and Audrey, who is there to supplement the common types and names of common materials, is slightly annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, she has forgotten what is called "the audience." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Audrey heard a slight percussion and was busy looking down at the top of the bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was pleasantly surprised to see Mr. "The Fool" tapping the edge of the table with his right index finger and lightly beheading himself and making a gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? Audrey was puzzled for a while and her eyes were blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is waiting to ask questions, and the eyes of the "reader" in front of her eyes have changed, and a lot of notes have been added:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Main material: Phantom Yalong's complete pituitary gland (also known as the colorful lizard), the semi-phantom rabbit's spinal fluid 10 ml (also known as the Farsman rabbit)."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Auxiliary materials..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know all of these! Audrey was a glimpse, and immediately there was a strong joy from the bottom of her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Mr. Fool, you are really very knowledgeable." She looked up again, sincerely thank and praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Upside down" Alger is not sure what happened, but the discourse on "justice" is very disdainful:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can a great person like a god describe it with erudition? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This existence is, in a way, itself equal to knowledge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein accepted the praise of Miss Justice, because it was not something that happened to be the "reader" formula of the psychological alchemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——After pulling the "Sun" into the Tarot Club, he has been preventing similar problems based on the special nature of the other side of the Silver City, constantly looking for The corresponding information to learn, even if Dust Goodlin did not get the formula in time, he can easily complete the comment, and after the previous divination and the previous comparison, he is convinced that the two "readers" formula are correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is prepared, no evil... Cranillo thought with a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey repeatedly read the "Reading the Heart" formula several times, reluctantly regained his eyes, familiarly "expressed" the diary of Russell the Great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what you deserve." She put down the pen and looked at the fool in the fog. "In addition, I will give you the best 300. How about 300 pounds?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said that there is a bit of a dim, because the three-page Russell Diary only spent 20 pounds, but also in the sequence of 8" The Sheriff's formula requires 450 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, starting with simple mathematics, she should pay another £430 in addition to the three-page note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Audrey feels that this also has its own lucky factors, the seller is not aware of the value of Russell’s diary, which allows her to be at a fairly low price. Bought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diary of Russell the Great, at least 50 pounds per page! Audrey quietly clenched her fist and silently drummed herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300 pounds? As of today, I have seen so much money in Sir Deville... Kline is screaming for a while, pretending to be indifferent to money without any interest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Rational transaction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the information of our readers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Efforts have been made to avoid the words "Beckland Bank" and "unregistered account" from the "fool" mouth, and directly present them on the sheepskin in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-When last week, when troubleshooting the red chimney house, Klein took time to go to the Tingen branch of Beckland Bank, and dressed up An unregistered account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This account only needs to remember the account number and give the corresponding ciphertext to take out the balance at all branches of Beckland Bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the account holder feels that this method is not enough insurance, it is also more troublesome to attach a signature and fingerprint comparison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein for confidentiality, in order to hide his identity, was not set up at the time, leaving only a set of ciphertext. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of ciphertexts is written in ancient Hermes. "The fools who do not belong to this era, the mysterious masters above the fog, the yellow and black for good luck." s King". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the ancient Hermes language itself can be used for sacrifice and prayer without protection, no matter who you are, if you dare to copy this ciphertext, you are mourning My name, as a result, I can immediately receive the corresponding prompts, to distinguish the normal situation on the fog, or who wants to steal my wealth! Klein was very happy with the way he came up with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only downside is that it will slightly leak the existence of "fool", but it is an acceptable category. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey pushed Russell’s diary to Mr. Fool, and took the parchment with the information of the other person, marked with Baker Rand Bank and the corresponding unregistered account consisting of a series of numbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
