			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Picking up the slender blood crystals and smelling the faint sulphur, Klein vaguely felt the corrosive power in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legendary abyss is the most polluting place, even angels will fall out of control, and those who guard the abyss will eventually be assimilated by the abyss... The characteristic of the 'model' is quite consistent with this point. Well, the deepening of the 'desire apostle'?" Klein let his thoughts spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, he noticed a detail, that is, Gilhies swears allegiance to the "death", not the "immortal king" Agari Figure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does this mean that the real 'immortal king' is actually a 'death', and Agari is just its spokesperson, or the management of pollution objects? Hey, rumored that Agarito is not a god, not to the sequence 4, relying on the 'death' to become one of the four kings, if this is the case, then his actual situation may be worse than I expected, fundamentally No autonomy...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, it is not excluded that he is a sequence 4, and the relationship with the 'death' is a possibility, 'devil', total It’s blackmail, like to mislead others...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has been indulging for a few seconds, once again trying divination to see if he can get the inspiration for the use of the slender blood crystal <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not worried that this will cause big trouble, or that he is ready for big troubles, even if he connects the demon in the Abyss Wang, at most, is equivalent to a "real creator" and "eternal yang" type of anti-phasic, Klein asks for fog It is able to block and suppress.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time, it won’t be locked in position, the problem is not big... and it’s just divination, there’s nothing Dangerous, so the "death" is definitely not the demon of the sequence 0 level... Hey, isn't this obvious? If it is really the demon of the sequence 0, or the seal of the king of angels, the level of the seal, not at all Need to avoid me and the "mysterious queen", "star above", Anderson's joint hand ... Klein suddenly found out that he was scared himself, and began to seriously "dream divination."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray world, he saw a world filled with thick black fog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Composed of dark giant meat The monster squirmed close, and the body screamed with anger:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Proverbs! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture turned, and there was an old-fashioned, bloody altar with the words and symbols full of filth. What is shouting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray world ruptured, and Klein slowly opened his eyes and sat up straight.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tapped the mottled long table edge and silently said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" '呓语者' means 'death' Before becoming a seal, was a 'slanger' from the abyss, or was it a huge monster composed of dark meat, killed by the slang, and became a seal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, no matter what, there will definitely be a boat involved, otherwise it will not solidify into what it is now.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm... From the big laughter that is close to being out of control, the 'death number' may be larger than the 'slanger', and it can be judged initially that it is not a seal of '0' level. Otherwise, the 'immortal king' should be the first of the four kings... probably sequence 3? Moreover, Agarito and its combination are obviously not ideal, and the degree of play is not too high. At the top of the sequence 4...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The one is filthy and shouting The altar symbolizes that the blood crystal can be used to summon the high demons? For example, a 'slanger'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how to summon the high demons, nor this The intended Klein immediately threw the slender blood crystals together with the shiny spar left by the "Light Priest" - the extraordinary characteristics were thrown into the heap of debris, and the name of the former was very perfunctory:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The slang" breath! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing this, Klein carefully tried another divination, and that is to confirm whether he is in danger tonight, from "The King of Undead "The danger of Agarito." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, his answer to divination has been expected, that is, "the king of immortality" Agaritu will not go to the island! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because Toskat has a hidden half-god, ordinary people are not clear, but the "four kings" have a certain understanding, and Agari The map hardly confronts other demigods, and forcing them into the "territory" of the other party is not his style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is based on Klein’s previous speculation to draw a conclusion: Agaritu simply did not dare to leave the "death", and "death" did not The law is coming ashore! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Klein got a very safe revelation tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that he does not need to change his appearance and move to another hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning at 9 am, Klein just came to one The restaurant, looking for a place to sit down, saw Anderson Hood did not know where to drill out, butt welded to the opposite side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strongest hunter uses his fingers to comb the golden short hair, let it turn into a three-seven, and look at German Sparrow, 啧啧Laughter: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great, in the case of a pair of three, you can also kill Gilthias!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The way you dragged the demon's body downstairs, it has spread throughout the port of Toscat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it is said that all the pirates carrying the bounty have decided to stay away from your sight and not appear within 5 kilometers of you!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since knowing Frank Lee, Klein, who almost quit milk, raised a cup of coffee, added a white bread, two slices of toast, a roast pork sausage and a dish. Butter, then responded very flatly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your intelligence is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson I laughed a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a must-have quality for hunters. Hey, Toskat's adventurers are discussing a serious issue. Who is the strongest hunter!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Greman. Sparo looked up at himself, his eyes were cold, his meaning was unknown, Anderson’s smile was a card. Live, he said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They all chose you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, here is after all Sunia Sea, not the foggy sea"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you want to make up the following sentence? It's very easy to behave... Klein seems to casually ask casually:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Anderson suddenly felt that his understanding ability had obstacles.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What other information?" Klein repeated it in more detail.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And..." Anderson suddenly squinted, "Morson of the 'New Lun Party' mysterious last night." Missing, in the protection of countless bodyguards, in my own room, mysteriously disappeared! The official rhetoric is that Mosona has died. The reason may be to worship the evil spirits or summon the devil. Hey, no one believes this because the Storm Church received an anonymous letter detailing the crime facts of Mosona and providing evidence. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at German Sparrow and looked forward to the crazy adventurer giving more information.<br /><br />&nbsp He clearly remembers that Gelman Sparrow had asked who should kill yesterday afternoon, and his answer was Mosona, the "New Lun Party."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein "hmm", did not say the extra words.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a figure rushed into the hotel, I glanced around and walked over to Klein with joy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the owner of the previous bar.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Spallo. The boss took off the soft hat in the middle of the depression and walked a courtesy. "There has been confirmed, but it still takes two days. After all, the number is too large. Oh, I know that you will definitely leave today, so, Without delaying your trip, I decided to pay the rewards to you. Well, this part is the liquidity of the bar, and part of it is the arrears that I borrowed from several friends. You can count it. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
