			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Golden Dream" is out of the storm, and the blushing moonlight shines through the thin layer of clouds, spilling into the dark room without candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi stood by the bed, motionless, as if he had met the extraordinary ability of Medusa's gaze or petrochemical type. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teeth of his teeth can’t stop, the legs are invisible but they are hard to contain, and the echoes in his mind are the boundless gray. The foggy, sorghum-like blurry figure and the low and majestic voice of "my name should be in my heart." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, this really will respond...I will really respond!" Daniz’s lips twitched, silently, and felt his calf It has become noticeably soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the first time he met a prayer to get a response! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scares him almost to the soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has long known that "fool" is an unknown existence, is the object of the hidden organization behind Gelman Spalo, and because of himself I have already had a connection with the name of the other person. Once there is no reverence or betrayal, I will be inexplicably violent, but these understandings are all derived from the knowledge taught by Edwina, "Iceberger" I have never encountered a similar thing, and I never thought that an unknown existence would respond to myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fog, figure and sound suddenly appeared in the front of his eyes, he first knew that there would be a great existence directly responding to believers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Daniz has unwittingly changed the unknown existence into a great existence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of shock suddenly feels a little calm, he quickly took a deep breath, and then tried to pace back and forth, to resolve the fear of his inner remnants, but he just took the right Feet, I found that I really had a soft leg, and I could only turn to the bedside and barely turned and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really great, it’s true...” Daniz whispered, clearly realizing that he really had a big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was in the world of books, he only mourned his name and found no other abnormalities, so he only feared because of the consequences. Now, what he is facing is the hidden danger of finally presenting outlines, and more unknowns that are more invisible, which makes him unable to extricate himself from extreme fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Daniz breathed a sigh of relief and comforted himself in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not necessarily a bad thing, at least Gilman Spalo is not only alive, but also lives very well!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of this, he forcibly smiled, Silently said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am also a member of the secret organization in the future, who is a blessed person with great existence..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking between the moments, Daniz decided to wake up in the morning and also to pray. He believes that no one exists and does not like the believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he will remember the gods, and usually pray in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the consumption of Klein fell asleep wake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly woke up, saw the sky outside the window, the ground was wet, the house was left with water stains, the whole world seemed to be washed again, unusually fresh, but messy leaves The broken branches, all kinds of rubbish also showed that it was not calm last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wash is finished, Klein is facing the ordinary Lun face of Zhang Pu, and asks for a cup of "eucalyptus sap" from Ximim Island. And a relatively strong "Tyatiwa" relative to breakfast to make up for last night's consumption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking a drink with the same flavor and sugar and milk lemonade, eating the delicious meat and the sweet and sour taste of the mixed fish, Klein I picked up several newspapers provided by the hotel and started from the "Sinian Morning Post" and "News". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bloody guilt in the storm:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" According to a valid source, late last night, 'Crazy Captain' Connor Victor's 'single-eye nickname', The pirates had a fierce guilt, and they executed the 'Crazy Captain' and killed each other. No one seemed to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sins of all this are covered by the storm of terror, no one knows the truth, even until the 'single-eyed nickname' floats near the Westam Pier, things are Found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a photo below the report that is not clear, which seems to stem from the sneak shot at the dock location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the photo, the "single-eye nickname" is clearly characterized and can be recognized at a glance. It is seriously damaged, and it is black and black. Only one mast is still intact. But in the middle position there is a figure wearing a triangular hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s Connors Victor...he died like this?” Klein’s pupils shrank and thought calmly. “Now it’s almost certain, last night on board. There is a demigod... He saw that the 'Crazy Captain' has been stared at, or was chased by the 'Sea King' and can only take care of himself, not taking Connors, so decisively destroying and destroying all the evidence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Kline, who was also planning to continue to track the "Crazy Captain", was low and found that although the clues have not been completely interrupted, there is not much left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing he knows at the moment is that the half-god probability belongs to the "black emperor" approach! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With the intensity of the storm last night, 'single-eyed nickname' should be the 'Nepte King' Yann Courtman sent to the dock for follow-up investigation I don't know if they have any extra gains... Well, let Mr. 'Inverted Man' in the storm church to inquire about it... This doesn't need to be conveyed, the afternoon is the Tarot Club, and the 'world' directly submits the commission..." Klein quickly got the idea and drank the last bit of "eucalyptus sap". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he returned to the room, ready to take out the radio ticker that had been placed on the fog for a long time to contact the "mirror" Arrods. See if it knows other clues about the "Mage Master" potion recipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- After leaving the sea east of Olavi, the place that was previously stared at by the Aurora, Klein has dared to use a foggy atmosphere. Something, however, he knows that it can't be too frequent, and it can't last too long, otherwise it may be captured by the "real creator." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason and the alertness of "Magic Mirror" Arrods, he intends to do it himself, can ask others to ask Others, there is really no way to play a quiz game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebel Private Port, "The Blue Avenger" docked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger intends to make a final supply before returning to Paso Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructed the crew to buy what items, he put on the indigenous style of clothing, all the way into Baiam, around a few laps, to the "Cave Church" Prepare to report to the parish bishop Jogori what he has done recently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he returned to Paso Island this time to report to the top of the church, he knows very well who his current boss is, knowing what to do The gesture must be done enough to prevent the other party from having to circumvent him and establish a direct connection with the above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of Jogori is still very embarrassing, very satisfied with Alger’s initiative, after listening, the speed is quite fast:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a normal job, you don't have to worry about anything, I have already told Lord Kotman that you are devout to the Lord and loyal to the church, one of the most trusted 'captains', and Lord Kotman will tell the cardinal meeting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused, did not give space for Alger to speak, continue to preach:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, there is a task to investigate those who have close ties with the 'Crazy Captain' Connors Victor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is the task that Lord Kotman directly confessed, you must pay attention. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
