			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was not long after Klein and others had used lunch, and the detective who had taken leave returned to Green Park Street, which meant that the commission he accepted ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the obvious improvement in the situation of Atru, Logor Caroman was quite generous in the settlement of his remuneration, and a premium on the basis of 10 pounds. Fifty percent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a jeweler, it’s really generous, but compared to other people in the West End and Queens, he’s not so rich, Green Park. The street is close to the suburbs, not far from the cemetery. I can run for ten minutes. The number of bodyguards, no, Miss Sharon, the big probability is the strongest of the sequence 5. The charge is three days and one thousand pounds. And as the extraordinary person of Sequence 7, only 15 pounds a day, the gap is still a little big..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, if you have this every day Mission, my annual income will exceed 5,400 pounds, which is the top level of the middle class. The first manager of Beckland Bank is only 5,000 pounds a year... Oh, this is just a fantasy, for most detectives, it is really I don’t open it in a week, I open it for a week... And the extraordinary materials I need to promote the sequence 6 add up to more than 3,000 pounds. It’s a headache for me to think about it. For ordinary people, this is a huge fortune and can last a good life. Huge wealth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The good news is that even if you master the method, the potion that digests sequence 7 will take six months to three years, even if I can quickly summarize the rules of the 'magician'. At least one or two months in advance, I still have enough time to save money and gather clues about the materials..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, Miss Justice just seems to return I owe me, my amount is 5,000 pounds..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But her recent financial situation is not very good, it is difficult to come up again in a few months Such a large sum of money..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the three five-pound denominations, and the thoughts left the West End very divergently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning to Minsk Street, he quickly burned the used paper people and added two extras. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the evening, he took the steam subway to the Beckland Bridge area and, according to the numbers provided in the newspaper, knocked on the door of the party house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As before, he wears an iron mask that covers only the upper half of the face, and puts on a black robes with a hood, at the waiter's Under the guidance, I entered the living room where only one candle was quietly burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first glance, Klein found that the extraordinary of this gathering was nearly half less than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am taking the time to come, others are late? Klein didn't change his walking posture and habits this time, picked the corner and sat down slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, the "eye of wisdom" old man cleared his throat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Start the party, other people should not come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said this, he explained a few words:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because that serial killing has never been able to find the murderer, most of the extraordinary people who are the night occupants, the punitives, the mechanical heart and the military squad are sent out and are doing large-scale "Troubleshooting and searching."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this situation, those friends who are unwilling to go out and not willing to participate in the party are very normal and understandable things." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frankly speaking, people coming today are much more than I imagined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, extraordinary The circle is not isolated, it will also be affected by current events... Klein looked around and saw that the chubby pharmacist was not absent, and his heart relaxed a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pharmacist pushed the iron mask on his face and shouted without any hope:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The medullary crystal of the Spring of the Elf is purchased, the price can be negotiated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is worried that others have found such extraordinary materials to make their cargo backlog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Although extraordinary materials are scarce, there are few repetitions in separate circles, but this kind of thing is not afraid of 10,000, just in case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Buy the medullary crystal of the Spring of the Elf..." The pharmacist did not seem to hear anyone responding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking halfway, he suddenly slammed and slammed his head and looked at Klein, his eyes screaming hotly:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Klein couldn't bear the other's burning gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered with affirmation, rolled up his black robes and took out an iron cigarette case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Klein opened the cigarette case and exposed the medullary crystal of the fading egg-like elf fountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't feel at ease, you can make the ‘Wisdom Eyes’ Mr. an appraisal.” Klein added a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually not necessary, because it is not a clear material at a glance, and after getting the hand, whether it is contaminated or not can be quickly discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if occult knowledge is not rich enough, it is easy for extraordinary people to mix similar materials. In this case, it needs to be identified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pharmacist is like looking at a beautiful girl who has been coveting for a long time, obsessively watching the extraordinary materials in Kline’s hands, and then shook his head after a few seconds:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no need!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's it!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's micro-hook corner, opened the price:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"300 pounds, and clues to the formula of the pharmacist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The clue of the pharmacist formula...you are!" The pharmacist stunned and finally Understand who is the opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the guy who let him run with a sedative! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he was so sad that he regretted the extreme sigh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really are a Lucky!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why didn't I choose that lucky road..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, I am the king of yellow and black who is in charge of good luck... Kline himself spit out. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ The clue of the recipe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The clue of the recipe is only incidental, because I can't confirm its true and false, so, 300 pounds, a penny can not be less, I I think there should be someone else in need of something else.” Klein smiled. “This price is actually fair. If you change someone else, you may ask for a price of 400 or even 500 pounds, and you may accept it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won't be so stupid, I can wait..." The pharmacist muttered two words. "The clues can make the old man, the amount, the 'eye of wisdom', the old man." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It must be an objective existence, detailed and detailed things, I can identify, simple clues are not in this rank." "Eye of Wisdom" Mr. Lao reminded a sentence . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And divination can roughly determine whether the clue is valid, without involving two or three levels of power higher than itself... Klein silently said a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay... 300 pounds plus clues, you earned!" The pharmacist took a breath, rubbed out a stack of thick cash, counted the corresponding amount, and then asked the waiter to take the pen and write it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brushing brush, he made a clue, smashed the paper into a ball, and cash, and several other items, handed it to the waiter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the waiter came over, Klein glanced at him and suddenly he was a little sleepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in addition to cash and clues, there are four additional glass tubes with seemingly pure liquids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?" Klein asked with a doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you forgotten? The sedative you want, my special sedative, each 10 sul, four pounds, so the cash is 298 pounds. The pharmacist replied, "If you are not assured of my sedative, you can apply for identification."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forgot...I’m all in order to win Sharon Miss, but now she is not here, um, okay, standing sedatives may be able to cope with certain unexpected situations... Klein no longer speaks, shakes out the medullary crystal of the Spring of the Elf, takes over those things, in front of all The person's face counts cash, and the true candle is discerned by the weak candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A total of 298 pounds... Yes... Seeing that the wallet has not been able to put more cash, Klein had to roll up those banknotes and stuff them into the pockets. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After picking up the sedative, he unfolded the note and aimed at the clue:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; District, Rose Garden, Harvest Church, find Bishop Utłwski. As long as you can help him complete a task, you may get a pharmacist formula."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bumper harvest Church, this is the church of the Mother Earth Church in the kingdom, and this church has two extraordinary ways of "cultivator" and "pharmacist"... The clues are very consistent... Klein reinvented thoughtfully Paper strips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party pushed forward, the female extraordinary person behind the "artisan" did not know whether to participate, or did not get a new extraordinary weapon, never heard Let Klein's expectations fall into the air - he now has 509 pounds of cash, you can think about equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many transactions, a man sitting on a high stool has a low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I have a friend who was unfortunately found in this big investigation, and was imprisoned and locked into the ground of a storm church. I want to ask some helpers to rescue him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Eye of Wisdom" immediately responded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Wild Dog', give up this plan! A storm church The punishers and seals are enough to destroy all of us here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ending of your friend is destined, you should not let yourself fall into the same desperate situation." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wild dog" looked around and found that no one responded to himself, could not help but slammed his thigh, whispered:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what exactly did he do wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a good physician, he saved a lot Patient, he never Whoever harmed him! Just because he took the potion and became an extraordinary person, he was detained to a place where he could never see the sun, or even an experimental product of a punisher?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wild Dog" Pain The desperate question reverberated in the room, and even the pharmacist who could not keep his mouth kept silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哎... Once the official extraordinary Klein could only sigh for a long time in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of the publication of the "playing the law", the wild extraordinary are part of the time bomb...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
