			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bronze long table side, "nightmare" presented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a man of 30 years old with dark blue eyes, long cheeks, more obvious grooves on both sides of the nose, mouth and chin It is full of not thick beards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the pain and distortion that can be intuitively felt, he pressed his chest and handed it a courtesy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the previous "no face", this "nightmare" was obviously less embarrassing and fragile after being released, and it was not because of "night" The way to improve the spirit is stronger than the "divination" approach, or because he is grazing for a shorter period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sighed and asked directly in a psychic way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you? Will you die in the hands of Zilingers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "nightmare" corner of the mouth, revealing a bitter smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the red glove in the night, and I am chasing a collection of ancient documents from the royal tomb of the Bailang, which are suspected to be related to the fallen god.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I found that some of them may have fallen into the hands of a rich man, so he led two companions and boarded the ship he was riding. Unfortunately, we were about to investigate and we met the Qilingus fleet. Attack. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about your companion? Klein asked a subconsciously.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Nightmare" said with a little pain:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" We had the opportunity to leave, even killing Zilingers with skilled cooperation, but our ship sank and could only change to the lifeboat. Everyone, everyone is dead, no, no job! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May the goddess bless you... Klein silently drew a red moon in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This made him more aware that the battles at sea are very different from those on land, and environmental factors are of the utmost importance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the "sailor" approach The sequencer will be very disadvantaged!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not the size of the "flying carpet", it is not easy to carry, and the speed is very slow, it is easy to become a target, Kline is sure Will choose to leave it, give Daniz cash.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, I have a fisherman’s jealousy, you can find “artisans” to make underwater sneak magical items... ... It is a pity that "artisans" are very difficult to find. Most of them are in the steam church. There are not many wild ones. Otherwise, the magical items that are circulated will not be scarce to the present level. It is really impossible, but you still have to ask for "downside down people." Mr. Help... Klein looked at the "nightmare" in front of the public, and gently leaned back: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You  what name? What are the unfinished wishes? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "nightmare" figure has slowly dissipated, and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" My name is David Raymond. I lost my parents, my wife and my brothers and sisters in a dark magic incident. There is only one daughter left. Her name is Nilu. She was born in 1330. She is a very cute girl. I am sorry. In order to trace the truth of the dark magic incident, I joined the night owl, and later became a red glove. I have not accompanied her for a long time, so that she lost her mother and lost her father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I believe that the church will definitely give her the pension a lot, and give some help in secret, I am not worried about her. Life, I only hope that I can see her under the witness of the goddess, enter the marriage hall, have their own family, no longer alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This year It was in 1350 that she might have had the object of marriage.” Klein was half-sighed and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time flies so fast..." David Raymond responded with a nightmare, "tell her, all the murderers have been disciplined, I am because The accident died, no need to hate anyone, tell her, Dad loves her, Dad is very sorry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His figure is more and more transparent, and the line will disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed his eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where does she live?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the name of the rich man who has collected the literature of death? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We live in Connaught City, Desi County, a beautiful coastal city with rubber nearby. If she didn't move, she still lives. No. 67, Red Indus Street... The rich man is called Jimmy Neck, and he should have fallen to the hands of Zilingers...” David Raymond’s voice has not fallen, the figure has completely dispersed, leaving only on the surface of the glove. A dark, deep gem-like gelatinous substance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the scene quietly, after a few seconds to raise his right hand, on the chest The hour hand has been clicked four times, and the opening is low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is a chance, I will go see your daughter and see how she is doing now. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the palace of the giant's residence, there is no fog, no ups and downs, no change.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Klein retracted the extraordinary character of David Raymond, licking the forehead and turning his attention back to the death literature:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Death' The route and the 'night' route can be exchanged in high sequences, and the church sends people to trace the whereabouts of the corresponding literature without any strange places... Jimmy Neck does not know if he is dead or not, have to inquire about it... if he is already in the tragedy Passing away, and things fall in the hands of Qilingus, it has to be checked from the pirates... The fleet of Qilingus is now attributable to the 'disease of the 'Treasure...'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the "death", it may be helpful to help Mr. Azick, Klein decided to check it out, and if there is any difficulty, write a letter directly to inform the public.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After clearing his thoughts, he quickly returns to the real world and uses the ritual to "squirm Hungry" came out again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, it’s not too late, he gave up his intention to make up his sleep and decided to summarize the experience of last night’s action. And the lesson.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Klein, the biggest lesson is to overestimate the patience of the “deceased”.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he had hoped was that even if there were certain accidents in the past, the “deceased punters” could restrain themselves and wait for the real protagonist’s real goal “steel” Mavietti to debut.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, they will definitely use the seals of many people to dream, and control all the wild extraordinary people who are blended in, but the nature is special, they can detect dreams and forcibly break free. I can calmly deal with the "steel" Maviti and his helpers, complete the "second kill" achievement, and take away one or two bodies... As a result, just after an accident, the violent old brothers all rushed out. Even if there is no reserve team to prevent accidents, at most, the seal holders will stay on the periphery and have one The two protectors... Klein wants to be more and more dumbfounded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not “steel”, the Mavitian gang is more cautious, with at least two Extraordinary people and all the shackles and living corpses to block the "canon punishers" that may be pursued in the follow-up. Klein will face the situation of two dozens of five, so that he will choose to give up and directly carry out strategic transfer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most satisfying thing for Klein is that his targeted preparations are doing quite well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the professional habit of "Magic"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the characteristics of the first five sequences of the heterogeneous pathway have long been known from Miss Sharon and Maric, Klein knows that there has been a "crazy" stage. "Iron" can use irrational factors to counter the thoughts and influence the extraordinary ability of the spirit. It has strong resistance in this respect. Therefore, he gave up the "psychological doctor" of "Dragon" and "frenzy" and gave up. The "nightmare", which is obviously not as strong as the "Prisoner of Punishment" seal, only uses the "mental piercing" and "light priest" purification ability of the "interrogator". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——“spiritual piercing” is a non-interfering thought that affects the extraordinary ability of the spirit, but a means of directly attacking the spirit. In essence, the other acts on "Mental body", its goal is "spiritual body", there is a significant difference between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The set of 'continuous strokes', as long as one link fails to produce the expected effect, 'Steel' Maviti can slow down, so that I can not Complete the quick kill, and in the current environment, this means failure, um... I also use this method in a targeted way to indulge the fact that the faction is easily controlled by emotions. I believe that once the spirit is created, the probability will be crazy. Counterattack, regardless of other...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
