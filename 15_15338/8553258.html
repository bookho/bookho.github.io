			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of the Northern Continents has recognized that the Quaternary is covered with a thick fog, making people unable to see the true appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are too many missing and vague records in all aspects of this history. The unearthed mausoleums, ancient cities and literature are few and far between, and cannot be effectively validated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that the relevant research is not done, and that there is little or no meaning that there are still some relics and information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Klein is an avid fan of Quaternary history, has read a lot of papers and books, and now he still remembers a lot of content:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is the Solomon Empire, or the Tudor dynasty, the Terencer Empire has a close architectural style, characterized by a violation of common sense, messy asymmetry, and love of black. Architectural style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, the most representative ones are the slashed pattern on the candlesticks and black walls that fall from the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, Klein raised the lantern and saw the metal round rod that had spread from the dome and the candlestick inlaid on the bottom of it. One reaction is that this underground building belongs to the Quaternary, belonging to the ancient time that covered the heavy fog and made many historians and archaeologists regret the regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There have been several papers mentioning that the number of candlesticks is different in different buildings. Although the three empires admire the asymmetrical beauty, However, it seems that there are strict and detailed regulations in all aspects... Left 3 and right 2 are the highest specifications that ordinary people can enjoy. This is judged from the architectural pattern and the legacy of the house...” Klein raised his arm and lifted the lantern. While slowly moving forward, count the candlesticks on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hall is wider than he expected. He walked at least a hundred meters before he saw the platform half a meter above the ground. That marks the thick wall at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 41 inverted candlesticks on the left, 40 on the right, this is a bit exaggerated. Which class does it belong to? Big aristocracy? Hey, Antignus family The Chalatu family can be both Quaternary aristocrats... They are also powerful and terrible extraordinary families, and other great aristocrats should not be bad..." Klein held the lantern and continued on, seeing the half-height The ladder on the side of the platform saw the mark of the cutting of the axe on the black stone brick on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the ruins of the Quaternary? Klein thought of the flashing room, relying on keen eyesight, leaning against the light of the lantern, found that the platform half a meter above the ground was placed with two iron-black seats, huge seats, old seats, overlooking The seat below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two whole! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two? Why are there two? According to the layout, the seat here should belong to the place with the highest power in this place, but there are actually two? Parallel big aristocrats? Double count, double duke, double prince? Klein slowly felt that his historical knowledge was not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly remembers that many papers have mentioned that Solomon, Tudor and Tronzost have a strict hierarchy within the three empires, with distinct levels. Insurmountable, starting from this theory, within a force, there should be no juxtaposed leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Weird..." Klein groaned, saying that he said to the bodyguard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's weird?" The illusory whistling sound suddenly sounded behind him, in the dark, empty, empty, ancient hall, which is extraordinarily embarrassing. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s mouth twitched, and he told the other person’s observed characteristics, the corresponding historical knowledge, and the doubtful place, and added the end. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ventilation is very good here, I don't know if there are other entrances."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half The dark bodyguard lady listened quietly and silently, and looked at Klein deeply:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you know so much?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I am a college student in history... Klein spoke in her heart and smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not choosing to be a detective, maybe I will be a conscientious young historian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguard did not respond, and did not disappear again. It first floated on the half-height platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein carried the lantern, followed by the semi-high platform, which was nearly 40 meters wide and 10 meters vertically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The architectural style is magnificent and huge, and it is also one of the characteristics of the Quaternary." He casually mentioned, carefully came to the two iron black Before the huge seat, lift the lantern and take a hard look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be for the giants of three or four meters...there is a badge-like pattern on the back of the chair, here is a black crown...this side It’s a hand holding a scepter... I don’t know what it’s symbolizing...” Klein said to himself, not expecting the bodyguard to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the lady who floated her feet from the ground suddenly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the badge of the Tuo family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Klein looked away and found that the bodyguard was referring to the hand holding the scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure family? Is this the relic of the Quaternary Tudor dynasty? Is this the palace of which member of the royal family? Klein frowned slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know another badge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Side by side with members of the Tuyu family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguard lady shook her head and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing this situation, Klein had to give up the idea of ​​the study for a while, and instead said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the empire and the Terencer family established the empire, they all maintained the original style derived from the Solomon Empire, such as the inverted candlestick, the brand of slashing, etc., etc., which does not conform to the normal recognition. I know that if I am an emperor, even if a lot of things have to be inherited, I will make some changes to identify my own speciality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does this mean The three empires have hidden and unchanging connections?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He guessed that Solomon, Tudor and the Terencer family all held the “Black Emperor”, too Is the "lawyer" approach, a similar style is the need to play! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Bodyguard silently for a few seconds, spit out a few words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only the emperor can be called For the emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This confirms my thoughts? Klein didn't ask any more. He carried a lantern and circled around the two iron-black giant seats without any additional discoveries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's take another look." Kline suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice has not fallen, the bodyguard lady has drifted to the end of the semi-high platform, the surrounding cold and cold has not changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going a few meters forward, Klein saw the seven tall, heavy black stone doors on the wall at the bottom of the hall, with the help of the lanterns, which were arranged in turn. Two on the left, one in the middle and four on the right, perfectly fit the Quaternary pursuit of asymmetry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein handed the cane to the hand of the Tema, and threw a coin at random, whispering in silence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It should start from the left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;铮! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The copper penny rolled down and fell on his palm, with the portrait facing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We go to the left." Klein took the lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguard lady followed quietly until the door to the far left, and then fluttered and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It's the same from the right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, it doesn't matter if you don't take up the divination... Klein tilted his mouth, raised the horse, and looked at the door. Symbols and patterns on the screen: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark black is the bottom, embellished with enamel, surrounded by a circle of blush that is half covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
