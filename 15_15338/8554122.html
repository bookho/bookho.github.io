			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens, the luxury villa of Earl of Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the time to practice the piano, but Audrey is still sitting in front of the dressing table, thinking about how to look up and remember the Russell Diary in the evening. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she was surrounded by a hustle and bustle, and there was a boundless gray mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the fog, squatting with the "fool" figure, He is listening to a man who is vague and unable to see at all: <br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Pray for certain help;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for someone to help me get in touch with Russell's creative manuscript The bookmark of that;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does Mr. Fool know that I will be here today? After closing, I went to visit the Russell Memorial Exhibition and had the opportunity to get in touch with some things... Audrey was listening, but I was surprised, but I was not surprised:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; With the personality and ability of Mr. "Footer", it is still very easy to master such a small thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the specifics, it is not necessary for ordinary sequencers to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey is responding, and he hears that "The Fool" is low and plain: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can choose to accept this commission, or not accept it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount... Audrey sinks for two seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, I can give it a try, but I don't guarantee success."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only has a minimum of £500 The reward is not too interesting. The reason why she accepted this task is to wonder what special place the bookmark left by Russell’s remains is, so that the leader of Mr. Fool’s is so valued that it is opened up. Uncapped price code. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I was going to look at Russell’s diary today, just by the way... Audrey thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "fool" in the fog, Klein, gently decapitated and returned a word:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the illusion disappears completely, Audrey will look into the vanity mirror and look at herself seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is both nervous and ambitious to start the evening action plan:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cannot be detected as an abnormality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If after the event, the leader of Mr. Fool's has any action, I can't be the subject of doubt." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s definitely not possible to touch only that bookmark. Once lost, all eyes will be concentrated on me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Well...so, I have to show the same interest in all the same things for all the items, can't let others see that my main purpose is the bookmark, the whole process is soft, not awkward, in line with the truth and Logic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you cause minor unobtrusive damage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s just a bookmark...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey’s gaze sweeps through the same look on the dresser without focus, suddenly settled in On an open jewelry box, fixed in a pair of gemstone earrings decorated with fine needle there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of her mouth is a little upturned, her eyebrows are slightly curved, and she says to herself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With the help of Su Shi, it should be enough..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At 6 o'clock in the evening, Beckland, who was hard to see the sun in the current season, was dim and the gas lamps were lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom Museum sent away the last group of ordinary visitors, but ushered in a group of nobles, such as the lady of the Earl's family, the children of the Duke's family, and the young Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because knowing that some aristocratic children are often guilty of misfortunes, the "Mechanical Heart" of the West Gate squad leader Max Levimore Do not pretend to be a security guard, always staying next to the accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hair is neatly combed, wearing a monocle, and the style is like a university professor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monocle is actually a seal, codenamed "3 - 1328", nicknamed "The Eye of Crystal", through which, Max Levymore Can directly see the spirit, see the ghost, see the shadow, no longer afraid of the extraordinary to drive these things that are difficult to find to mess or steal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this seal also has significant disadvantages, that is, it is easy to attract monsters such as ghosts and shadows to the vicinity. If you wear it for a long time, your vision will be irreversible. reduce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the gloom of Beckland, she is like the bright sun..." At this moment, Max looked at the side of the blonde with admiration Blond girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey looked at the toilet inlaid with gold foil and engraved with complex patterns, and asked the interpreter next to him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the first flush toilet in the modern sense?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I personally think this is Luo One of Searle’s outstanding contributions to human civilization, and its associated sewer works, changed Trier Street, oh, the phenomenon of dirty things on the street.” The commentator originally wanted to say the word “feces”. But looking at the girl in front of me, I feel that I can't lose my elegant posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey considers it again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I touch it?"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can it still be used normally?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gregorian Viscount laughs next to him :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you so curious about this? No matter how old it is, it is always just a toilet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the aristocratic children who had a good relationship with them laughed out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Grein, you don't understand, this is the brilliance of human civilization." Audrey responded with a smile and made a vomit in her heart. expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t want to do this in order to complete the commission of Mr. Fool’s deaf... she sighed helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lecturer echoed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Hall said very well, the glory of human civilization Not only in weapons such as cannons and guns that have changed the form of war, but also in every detail of our lives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Miss, I am not I know that it can't be used normally, because no one will use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commentator said that he looked at Max Livimore and got affirmation. After the dagger, I continued:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can touch it, even open the water tank and look at the mechanical structure inside, but be careful." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Audrey looked at the security guards to open the glass wall, busy the first two steps, and extended the right palm of the white gauze glove, carefully Touch the pump button. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, she slowly stepped back and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, just like this. I am satisfied with my curiosity and can no longer hurt it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She always remembers that this time she is a girl who is innocent and curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading this, they entered the exhibition hall with Russell's diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the introduction of the half circle, Audrey asked again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I flip through this note? We are all interested in this strange symbol."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amount...I heard that it has exceeded a certain number of years The paper will be damaged if it is connected to the air, let alone touch it. Shouldn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She blinked and made herself look like a gem The beautiful nephew showed sincerity, longing, and a little bit of lost emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presenter looked at Max Livimore again and waited until the other party replied, laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The church has adopted a special preservation method to make the paper produce like the previous years, and even if there is no such method, we will try our best to meet the requirements, but we may need to change the environment. Change clothes and go through a more rigorous process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can flip it over, but don't take too long, don't use force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey’s eyes suddenly brighten, and people can’t move their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely thanking her, she and a occultist such as the Priest of Gretel, opened the glass cover and carefully flipped the note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey tried to remember, but because the symbols are too complicated, they can be remembered in a short period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Add up to almost two pages of content, I don't know if there is a way to print a copy..." Her thoughts spread out and gave way to the location. The peripheral companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, each of her exhibition halls has submitted a request to carefully appreciate something, and is basically satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go and stop, they came to the restored study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey maintains its previous state, and occasionally raises several questions, fully demonstrating its curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the interpreter introduced the "creative manuscript", her eyes opened brightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Can I flip it over? I want to see what the great inventor Russell's manuscript looks like and what whimsy it contains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No problem, beautiful Miss Hall, the distinguished Viscount of Glylint, you can all turn over, oh, if any of you is a believer in the church, you can even apply for a book." Rubbing the book." The interpreter replied according to Max's suggestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a goddess believer, Audrey can only respond with a smile, not convenient to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, she faked her hair, reached out and touched her right ear, and quietly removed the earring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the glass that enveloped the desk was opened, and Audrey stepped forward and held the manuscript, so that the bookmark was inadvertently pulled out and freely Turned over a page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Su Shi, who was hinted at by her, suddenly screamed in another direction:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Wang! Wang! Wang!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of everyone were immediately attracted to the past, Audrey dropped his arm, the earrings with the palm , stabbed to hold the bookmark, and silently recited the phrase "pirate king" in his heart, once again in Hemis, once again in ancient Hermes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp, fine-needle-like decoration touches the surface of the bookmark. It just has to penetrate deeper and penetrate the other side. Audrey suddenly feels strong and illusory. Resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abnormal resistance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This resistance flashed away, and the "fine needle" poked out a little stamp, almost punctured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really there is a reaction! It’s really weird!" Audrey glazed, didn't dare to try again, lifted her hand and put the bookmark in it. On the desktop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, she looked to Su Shi, calmly commanding the maid Anne:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm... ...you bring it to the bathroom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
