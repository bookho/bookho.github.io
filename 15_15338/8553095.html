			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both parties know the whereabouts of Helmouch’s manuscript, which will end in the evening... The ambassador will be able to draw his hand and have the strength Actions such as retaliation... This is why the danger is about to come? Klein probably understood the previous divination results and the inexplicable omen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no "dirty language" spell, there is no strong bodyguard of 1,000 pounds for three days, he will now mostly go to the police station to go to the steam and mechanical god church The Beckland headquarters of St. Hillland Church "temporarily stayed", avoiding possible attacks and waiting for the ambassador to be assassined - as for the success of the assassination, Klein was not sure, anyway, he had considered the worst results, There are also certain plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, with double preparations, he will undoubtedly not take the evasive strategy, still stay at home, do not know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his heart, he even looked forward to the attackers coming to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "hunter" of the sequence 9 is killed by me, and then sent, at least a sequence of 7, or even a sequence of 6, sequence 5, Or the number of heaps, no matter what, as long as they are solved, I will get the formula, get extraordinary features, and save some losses... Well, I will tell my bodyguard lady, I am lucky, from the "black ears" I bought. I got the benefit and became an extraordinary person. After all, if the battle is fierce, I can't hide this point, and I am almost telling the truth. I really got a lot of income from that "black ear"... Kline thought The next thing, almost instinctively to draw a blushing month on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May the goddess bless, come from the extraordinary of the "divination" approach! He silently prayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he looked around the room and wanted to find his own bodyguard. He worried that the other party had heard the story and ran quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living room dining room is warm and illuminating, illuminating the coffee table, sofa and chair, except for others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Klein gradually picked up, he suddenly saw a face on the glass cover of the gas lamp in the living room area, with a pale gold color and a delicate appearance. The face is pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lady is still very confident about her strength... Klein’s mind is calm and whispered like a self-speaking:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am also an extraordinary person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I took a party through Casper and bought a bet The luck of the goods has gained certain benefits. Of course, it is only for the benefit of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His two sentences are true, No matter what method you face, you will stand the test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the two sentences together make people think that the benefit makes him an extraordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face on the gas lamp glass cover nodded slightly and disappeared quickly, nothing else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s appearance does not seem to change, but the heart quietly vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the sofa area, did not take off his jacket, picked up a newspaper and flipped it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the sound of Dangdang resounded again, and someone rang the doorbell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who? Klein’s spirit was instantly tense, his hands were inserted into his pockets, and he touched the tarot cards and the “dirty words” spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked slowly to the gate, using the power of the clown, to foresee the scene that would be seen after opening the door:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red moon is still looming, the elegant gas street lamp has not changed, a sheriff wearing a black and white uniform with three V-shoulders is waiting impatiently at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His underarm has a brown-yellow short beard, the sheriff who had previously dealt with the "Sherlock. Moriarty Defence Case." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Embassy Embassy in Beckland West, the lights are bright, the smell of various perfumes and liquors is accompanied by melodious melody, towards Every corner spreads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dance is taking place here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, Becker has been a ambassador, often holding a ball at the embassy, ​​inviting bankers, big factory owners, big philanthropists, and others from the Kingdom of Lun. The famous rich and the barristers participated and randomly gave some merchants at the next level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this atmosphere, he will tell the guests about the prosperity and openness of Trier, saying that the Republic of Intis is no longer dominated by nobles, bankers, The factory owners, lawyers and other people are the masters of the country. They directly and indirectly take most of the seats, determine the direction of national policies, enjoy true freedom and have a lofty position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today’s Becker is doing something similar, holding a glass of wine and appearing in front of the guests, as if to prove that he is at the party at this time. , no going out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should have got the manuscript... I know from the detective that is trembled and afraid that Ian Wright appeared in the telegraph office on White Rum Street. After that, I was setting everything up, now is the time to harvest... Becker, who is thin but tastes, drank the bloody Ormill wine and went to the balcony, intending to blow the cool breeze of the night. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After knowing that Ian had sent the telegram, as a senior "conspirator" and professional intelligence personnel, Becker keenly thought of the other person's boss in contact with the boss. So he quickly let the two-sided spy investigation lurking in the Bakerland group of the Visak Empire intelligence agency, and got the time, place and manner of meeting agreed by Ian and the "team leader." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, he pretended not to do this, and continued to send people to find Ian near White Rum Street, successfully found the other side, and also attracted military intelligence. Blocking at the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his arrangement, the on-site intelligence personnel deliberately ran off Ian, so that the military intelligence department believed that the two sides were on the same starting line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After numb the main opponent, he mobilized another, unexposed intelligence officer, ambushing the "team leader" of Ian and the Fossack Empire, thinking In the absence of the military intelligence, the manuscript was found and the kingdom of Lun was brought out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress of the event was as smooth as he expected, and the news that came back in the evening made his mood very heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the military situation have appeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They should have been caught! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Rosago, it is definitely not a factor of divination, and the MI9 is ​​not good at divination... This shows that we have locusts inside... Hope Rosa Goneng took the first step, got the manuscript, and handed it to the "shadow" to take away... Becker deliberately organized the ball in order to avoid the suspicion, and then could not interfere with the progress of the matter, only pray for the subordinates to be effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his arrangement, Rosago will immediately transfer the item to another intelligence officer, an intelligence officer who has never been activated before, and then Rosago will lead the people in the MI9 and continue to interfere with the "line of sight" by creating some incidents, attracting attention for his companions. In the process, Becker asked Rosago to kill the little detective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it weren’t for him, things wouldn’t be known to the people in the military’s situation, everything would be very smooth...I’m not related to the Zmanger party. Will be exposed, it will not be transferred back to the country ... he did not escape, thinking that the military nine will always protect him, staying at home is safer than running away? Becker smashed his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has received the order, and after the action corresponding to the manuscript is over, he will hand over the intelligence-related matters to the first-class military attache of the embassy, ​​waiting for the new ambassador to take over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becker is quite reluctant here. Although Beckland has a bad weather and heavy pollution, it is one of the most prosperous cities in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ladies and ladies here are more conservative, not the domestic sluts, slowly seduce them to go to bed, a little bit to remove their conservative, is very fulfilling It’s a very fascinating thing, but unfortunately, I have to say goodbye to these beautiful people... Beckeran thought with a deep feeling of depression, and more resentful of the little detective who dared to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
