			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilcias was only slightly sideways, and the beer fell to the round table next to him, and it was a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the gunshots, he did not evade at all, it seems that he has intuitively seen through the illusion, and the alcoholic gamblers or their arms are squatting or scattered. In the chaotic environment of escape, the body leaped like a spring, and the eyes locked the cold adventurer wearing a dress and a dress at the entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German.Sparo...Gilsh Ai's pupil shrinks and his mouth opens, he must read the "dirty language" from the abyss . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Klein really pulled the trigger, a light gold bomb that just seemed to be fished out of the hot water, and rushed to the exact The bounty is a £9,500 "slayer." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Gilthias just raised his right hand, opened his fingers, and ignited a light blue flame in his palm, which was unimaginably caught. That bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet plunged into a "cage" and solidified in a pale blue flame, and the sun that followed would only be able to offset it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside Gilshiis, two figures stood up one after another, one was a short-haired woman with a double gun, and the other was a rough gloved Dahan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, he came to the port of Toscat to find supplies, not himself, or he must have a partner here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three extraordinary people... Gilthias may also be sequence 5... At this moment, Klein almost blurted out the words "I’m sorry, bothered" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attack the "demon", can not be prepared in advance, must rely on chance, and can not hesitate, or the other party immediately noticed the danger of malicious detection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in such a situation, it is really hard to say which situation is better for you! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not hesitate to turn, holding the revolver, from the crowd in the bar, from the kneeling drunk gambler head, agile and quickly rushed to the pass Go to the stairs on the second floor of the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just flashed in, and a light blue fireball hit the edge of the stairs and swelled in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the stairs collapsed a little while, the entire bar was shaken, and the strong smell of sulfur spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilcias and his two associates jumped over the bottom of the stairs without a delay, chasing German Sparrow madly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein rushed to the second floor and quickly opened the "spirit of the spirit" on the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes it easy for him to find a spacious room without humans. When the waist is turned and the sole of the foot is stepped on, he will turn in and jump out of the window and escape. bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Gilthias and his two companions also chased the second floor. As soon as they saw the scene, they immediately separated tacitly. The former continued to catch up. The latter two enter the room on the same side and go to the bottom to intercept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Klein and so on is this opportunity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly turned his body halfway, wearing the black gloved left palm to hold the air and twisted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman with the double gun and the big man wearing the glove did not notice that she continued her actions without any abnormality, rushed into another room and jumped from the window. Next, all the way away, no turning back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose and behavior of their "divided interception" was changed to "divided action" by Klein with the "distorted" of "the corrupt baron"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plopped, completed the "distorted" he fell to the ground, rolling inside the house, avoiding the light blue fireball shot by Gilch Ais. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the bang continues, the building where the bar is located is swaying and seems to have suffered an earthquake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Gilce Ess swiftly rushed into the rather spacious room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Greman. Sparo is rolling and jumping, not confronting himself, and his emotions are very well controlled. The "slayer" is immediately Zhang Open your mouth and spit out a smug word with your own devil:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things seem to be still in the room, Klein's rolling action is obviously slow, not so smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilcias did not hesitate to lock the other party and picked up another devil word:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s figure froze, stagnating in place, immediately becoming thinner and thinner, turning into a mottled red rust paper man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, wearing a black double-breasted gown wearing a black double-breasted dress, he appeared at the door and found the left palm of the evil black glove. Hold the handle and pull the crumbling door inward and hold it steady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noisy outside disappeared, and the room seemed to be independent and turned into a sturdy cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilshiis saw the body, his body swelled and he shattered his clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He instantly became a huge creature nearly three meters deep, the skin looks bleak, but it is dark and evil, and the goat's horns are bent out and covered. Countless mysterious patterns, behind a pair of bat-winged giant wings unfolding, entwined with a light blue flame, exudes a strong sulphur taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light blue fireball shot in the same direction, covering the door area, at the same time, Gilshi Ais’s scarlet eyes, mouth Then there is a sleazy devil spit out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"fallen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a range attack ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the light blue stuffed, Klein wore the left palm of the evil and noble gloves, and quickly twisted a half turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireballs suddenly lost their trajectory, and the chaos was like the irregular movement of tiny particles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hit the ceiling, they hit the door, they fell to the ground, they flew to Gilshies, for a while, in the room The sound of the bangs was undulating, and the seal effect produced by the "twisted" forces suffered a strong disability and shake, but there were still no obvious signs of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light blue glow rises, the sulphur tastes permeate, and Klein’s body suddenly bends down, covering the body with a slightly viscous black liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His figure exploded and turned into broken paper and fallen black fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he emerged on the other side, the skin appeared obviously dim, and the clothes on his body were bitten by the power of the explosion and the flame of the abyss. One after another, a gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of the "fallen" effect has some restraint on his "paper man substitute", so that he inevitably bears a certain impact, and the explosion The things that the rest of the wave can be controlled by Klein also hurt him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as soon as he first met, he "sent" Gilhies a beer and completed a "bribery" to attack himself. And the control effect has been greatly weakened! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
