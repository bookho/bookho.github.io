			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larousus is a "scammer" of Sequence 8, which happens to belong to the "Stolen" route, and the "admission ticket" with the corresponding party is not It’s too incomprehensible and acceptable. On the contrary, it’s very logical... It’s definitely easier to buy magical items that can steal other people’s extraordinary ability at the gathering of “Destiny Hermits”... It seems that this is "The Snake of Destiny" Will Ansein said the clue... Klein sat on the edge of the bed, and he was cheerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was busy arranging his own rituals, entering the fog, bringing the only eye-sized badge back to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badge bears the symbol of "destiny" and "hidden" on the front, and there is a small ancient Hermes inscription on the back: "Hold this thing, that is Can be added." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is about to infuse spirituality, inspire badges, send "information" out, and get the latest party time and place, but suddenly hesitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...In a moment, I forgot to forget the divination. Is it dangerous if there is a demigod elder in Llanus? My position, the trouble is big, it is like the previous 'disease lieutenant' Trey found in a very short time, 'not the old witch' as ​​a helper, can not help but be guarded... If you succeed, you have to be embarrassed when you are jealous!” Klein took his forehead and carefully re-entered the mysterious space above the fog, and used Diving to make a divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting no dangerous revelation, he sighed, left the fog, and sat in the easy chair in the hotel room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his spiritual perfusion, the surface of the badge bursts with a fascinating glow, and they quickly condense into an inconspicuous beam of light that shoots out in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the same beam returned, spread out into a palm-sized illusory parchment, with a line of words written in ancient Fossack:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At 9:00 pm on June 6, 1350, the Tasok River entered the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than 4 months... At this time, I have no problem collecting the main materials of the "Master of Secrets". The only obstacle is that the money is not enough, but this is not difficult. I now have 6945 pounds of assets and sell one more. Two extraordinary features are more than enough, and more than the sea is a mobile bounty, no, can not be so arrogant, have to exclude the four kings and seven generals ... What clues? Klein leaned forward and leaned back on his back, and began to think hard again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the gathering of the "Destiny Hermits", he suddenly thought of a person:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nad Mitchell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poet classmates participated in the "Destiny Hermit" gathering in the Babul Valley, regardless of the purpose, whether to perform official duties or to do private work, it is possible to get A magical item that steals the extraordinary ability of others... can you borrow him or buy it? Is this the real clue? Klein’s spirit was swift, and he quickly got a rough plan:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first step is to put the radio ticker on the fog to accumulate breath;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second step, a few days later, use the radio ticker to contact the mirror Arrodes;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Step 3, ask where you can more easily get magical items that steal the extraordinary ability of others;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the answer is clear, then the fourth step Just follow the prompts, simply reach the goal, if the answer is vague or full of danger, the fourth step asks the poet's classmates now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fifth step, let Emlin White, the guy holding this badge to find the poet classmates, see if he has the corresponding items, can you do it? A transaction. I don't come out directly, I will be recognized if I accidentally, it is also very troublesome, and Emlin is now a person of the Mother Earth Church, no, the ghost of the Mother Earth Church, let him go Contact, even if reported by a poet’s classmate or arrested on the spot, will not be tied to the firearm.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With what to do next and how to do it, Klein was refreshed and relaxed, and decided to go out and eat a Bayan specialty grilled fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep blue sea, painted with golden glow by the setting sun The Golden Dream is sailing quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz got the permission of the captain, and in a fascinating gaze, sometimes timidly shrinking and entering the other's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most inside is the bookshelf, with a book on top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina stands at the desk, holding a black water-absorbing pen and writing the words quickly:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I don't have a similar item, the same is true for Jodson, he said it will help you pay attention, but it needs to be lucky enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aide Wenna raised her head, and the clear blue eyes of the spring looked at Daniz:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You come to arrange the ceremony, summon The ceremony of the German Sparrow messenger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?" Daniz is thinking about whether he will receive special treatment from the captain. Pointing at myself strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Edwina folded the letter paper, straightened her body and nodded. "This will help you to familiarize yourself with similar rituals. I will review this later." "The content of the aspect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well..." Daniz put away the disappointment and tried to recall, slowly setting up the ceremony with only one candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, under the watchful eyes of Edwina, he smashed a shiny Lun gold coin and placed it on the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the letter paper, Daniz rehearsed twice in his heart before dare to go down the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a step back and used the ancient Hermes language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I!<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I call in my name:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spirit of vain, can be driven Friendly creature, belonging to the messenger of German Sparrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind in the wall of the spirit is stirring, and the hair of Daniz’s brown hair flies up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames swelled rapidly, as if the size of a human skull was so pale that it was like the stationery in Daniz’s hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Daniz saw a long hair pale gold, his eyes were bloody, and his bright-eyed head was drilled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, the messenger of Gilman Sparo is very special. How can spiritual creatures be completely like people, still so beautiful, just a little more than the captain? The lady, the amount...Daniz’s emotion suddenly caught, because he found that the head did not grow on his neck, but was held by one hand and the tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at one head after another and looked at the headless figure wearing a gloomy and complex long skirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still a spiritual creature...he was ashamed of what he had just thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a breath, Daniz was busy handing over the letter and saw one of his beautiful heads open his mouth and bite it with his white teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Renee 缇 Nicole’s other head also bit the gold coins on the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she did not leave immediately, and the four scarlet eyes of the remaining two heads turned at the same time, looking at Edwina Edwards outside the spiritual wall. Here, I looked up and down several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina feels that she is being examined and is being examined for fear that is hard to contain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenitt. Nikol took back his sight, and his figure was blurred, blending into the pale candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames are bright, the faint yellow is scattered, and everything is restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deniz just dismissed the spiritual wall and heard the captain say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not an ordinary spiritual creature..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
