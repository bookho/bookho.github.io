			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just put on a double-breasted long dress, picked up a half-high silk hat, walked to the door, and suddenly heard the illusory pray of reverberation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who? He frowned slightly, listening to the ear, but only confirmed that the petitioner is a woman, and the voice is intermittent, it seems to contain great pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that there is nothing particularly important, the new "magician" Klein throws it away, so that the half-height silk hat is hooked up to the coat accurately. On the shelf, he returned to the bedroom and took four steps back into the majestic palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he did not see which illusory star is expanding and shrinking the deep red light, but the end of the old and mottled bronze long table, the side of the Fool’s seat Fang, there is a clear brilliance in a circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Non-Talo members pray...Hugh, or the lady with a slightly curly brown hair?" Klein sat down with speculation. Your own position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he has taken the money out of the unregistered account, he has no doubt who is trying to steal his wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, Klein left his hand and spread the spirit, touching the aperture that swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenes around him changed, he saw the overturned coffee table, the sloping sofa, the books and papers on the floor, and a dying brown hair Ms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Klein heard the other party’s prayers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not belong, this The age, the fool..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"above the fog, the mysterious rule..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hands, good luck, the king of yellow and black..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me, save me..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save me"? Look at her look, some seem out of control, the hair is growing at a speed visible to the naked eye, the skin's cuticle has been covered with a strange white mans, how can I save it... Klein carefully observed for a few seconds Very embarrassed to say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he discerned a faint illusory inconspicuous proverb from the painful pray of the lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, slang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of horror slang before entering the fog, but it feels nothing crazy, not evil at all, and does not contain obvious malice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the woman is getting out of control because of the slang... If I don’t hear it, can I calm down and get better?" Ryan thoughtfully stretched his hand to the aperture that was constantly smashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, he left his own spiritual madness and established a solid mysterious connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——After being promoted to “Magician”, his spirituality is much richer, and the burden in this area is correspondingly smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fols’s head becomes more and more confused, feeling his own thoughts Like boiled boiling water, it keeps bubbling and wants to rush to the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm dying... I don't want to, don't, become a monster..." She just sorrowfully flashed such a thought in her mind, the tide The pain is overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she was awake, and the pain, irritability, madness, and despair that had been deeply rooted before seemed to be absent, but an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it so fast today? Are there any extensions during the bloody month? Fols doubtfully opened the eyes that he had just closed unconsciously, and saw that there was boundless gray fog underneath, and there was an ancient mottled bronze long table in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is this? She looked around and saw a towering stone pillar and saw the palace of the pillars propped up by the pillars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, she found the top of the bronze long table, with a mysterious anomaly that looked like a bird's-eye that was wrapped in thick fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is this? Who is he? Firth was alert and alert again in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, she remembered what she had just done! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is under extreme pain, mourning the mysterious mantra found in the History of the Aristocrats of the Kingdom of Lun, suspected of pointing to a certain evil Spiritual mystery mantra! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not just evil spirits! He could actually let me get rid of the terrible slang for a while... and pull me into this strange world... This...Folth endures the inner fear and half-lifts a ritual:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me, you are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, she suddenly remembered the specific content of the mantra Debating and debuting:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a fool! Amount, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a fool Yours?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiles first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Directly call me Mr. Fool." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he found that behind the chair where Fowles was sitting, the symbolic symbols and mysterious patterns formed by the stars were changing rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one or two seconds, there is a door that is layered inside, and the door is made up of countless illusory ones! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Door"? As soon as Klein saw the symbol, he immediately recalled Mr. Gate, who was mentioned in the Russell Diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party will be near the real world at the full moon, making a cry for help! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the slang just related to Mr. "Gate"? Um... Today is the bloody night, an enhanced version of the full moon... This lady corresponds to the "door", the symbol behind the former Miss Hugh’s seat is similar to the "Judge of Judgment"... Klein Micro The invisible location is down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He confirmed this situation, that is, once a strong connection is established and the other person is extraordinary, the symbol behind the corresponding seat will follow each other. The actual situation has changed. It is not necessary to join the Tarot Club and come to the fog regularly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in the heart of Fols, there was a storm: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fool...is really a fool ... that name is really pointing to a strong existence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is he going to do? Will it let me trade with my soul? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, at least, at least it’s better than losing control in that terrible slang... I’ve got a life back, and after all, it’s equal to earning... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between her thoughts, she suddenly heard the "fool" Mr. smiled and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every time you are at the full moon, you will hear a slang that doesn't know where you are from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does he know? Fols looked away and replied slyly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the voice did not fall, she suddenly thought of a possibility, and asked about it: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, you, know the origin of the proverb? You know who is infringing me? Do you know how to solve this problem completely?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a poor worm that is lost in the dark and trapped in the storm... Klein intends to use this I can very much shape the answer to my own image. After thinking about it, I feel that I can’t be sure that the slang that the woman heard before is indeed from Mr. Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to make mistakes, in order not to lose face in the future, he skipped the other’s problem and said with a smirk:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"He doesn't necessarily want to hurt you, maybe, he is just asking for help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the proverb is not malicious, not crazy, not evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me ask for help? But the slang has made me getting closer and out of control. If it wasn’t for you, I might have become a monster now." Erssi asked in disbelief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because you are too weak." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am too fragile?" Fols was wrong and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein explained a little:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your life level is too far from the other party Maybe, he just breathes normally, and the storm can tear you into pieces. Maybe he just glances at you and you will die on the spot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Of course, if he deliberately controls his own strength, he can't communicate with you normally. However, his voice may have to go through layers of obstacles to reach your ears. Deliberate control often means cry for help, huh, huh. I mean, suppose he is calling for help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of life is too far apart...Look at me, I will die on the spot...Fuls hears It took a long time to squeeze out a smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This reminds me of a sentence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not look directly at God..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled at her, not giving a positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that terrible proverb come from being close to the gods? "Footer" can help me to rule out the influence of the other party, and always talk about it in a rather plain tone... Does this mean that he is equal to the level of life that exists? The more I thought about it, the more shocked I was, and the body appeared to be shuddering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein waited for a few seconds and then asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every full moon How long will the proverb last?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three to five minutes, if it is a bloody night, it will be more than seven minutes." Fols converged thoughts, Answer honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When heard here, Klein increasingly felt that the owner of the proverb was Mr. "Gate". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He temporarily pressed this thing and smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few minutes later, you You can go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only one solution to the problem, which is to improve your life level."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folse hesitated the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whenever I meet the full moon, can I miss your name?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I will be your devotee!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no." Klein Smiles and shakes his head. "But I don't mind helping you with a bunch of help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you so much!" Fols suspected that he was doing with the evil spirits. Trading, but she never wants to experience the same kind of painful "nightmare" as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining this, she relaxed a lot, noticed that there were many seats around the bronze long table, so he tentatively asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Mr. Fool's, do you seem to have other people here often?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, maybe not necessarily Man...Folse silently added one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s attitude makes it easy to laugh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s a few people who are similar to you, I was pulled here for a variety of reasons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
