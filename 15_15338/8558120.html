			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The City of Generosity" Byam, in the consulate of Intis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilan sat in front of the dressing table and looked at the beautiful but slightly embarrassing self in the mirror, and took it out for a few minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time to escape the Black Death is both full of expectation and full of suffering for her, afraid of being accidentally discovered by pirates and adventurers. "The disease will be" Trey is caught back, completely lost his freedom, and can no longer return to his hometown and return to his original life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the family-remaining relationship, she hid in the consulate of the motherland and got the ticket to leave the sea, she relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still not enough to keep her mind steady, she believes that the real landing on the Northland is the end of everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it, Elaine couldn’t help but raise his right hand and stroked the cheek skin that was not too white but healthy enough to find that it was more delicate than it was. The sea merchants have improved a lot during the period, and there is a kind of reversal of time, returning to the illusion of the girlhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after entering the Consulate of Intis, she has another option to escape from the sea, that is, with the Storm Church, the Lun Army, and the Consulate section. The spy cooperated and used itself as a bait to arrest the "drug lieutenant" Trey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she thought for a long time, and finally gave up the plan, and even asked the family elders who served as consular officers to not tell others about what they were hiding here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, she has never caused any real harm to me. In many places, she will be accommodated me, meet me... except every night, every night... That too, that is just the surface... In the memory, Yilian’s cheeks suddenly flew red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are fascinating nights, the fierce entanglement of the body, the unimaginable joy, all passing in her mind, it is difficult to calm down for a short time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilan slowly took a breath and spit out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head, letting her longing for freedom renew her heart for her loved ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She once again looked at herself in the glasses and put the red hair falling in a circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, she painted her straight eyebrows and strengthened the shadows to make her look more distinct and deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After such a make-up, Elaine became more neutral and very heroic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took off her clothes, wrapped her chest with a cloth strip, and then put on a white shirt, black vest, men's trousers and a double-breasted long dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, she took off the silk hat and put it on the top of her head, covering up the red hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, she is more like a handsome young male than a woman in the mirror, especially the eyes of the green and gemstones seem to be suitable for similar appearances. There is a fascinating squat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilan waited patiently for a while until someone knocked on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She puts her luggage, opens the door, and follows the friend of the family elders all the way to the side door of the consulate garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A carriage has stopped there and will take her to the port, take the passenger ship, head to the port of Plitz in the Kingdom of Lun, and detour from there to Intis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilian has extraordinary anti-tracking skills, carefully examining the surroundings, including the coachman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local indigenous, thin and strong, do not like to wear a hat, the facial features compared to before seeing, nothing changed, the expression is a little nervous, this is normal... Yilian After confirming, I thanked the friend of the family elder, carrying the luggage and boarding the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wheel rolling room, she grinned out of the window, only saw a strain of Indus phoenix tree is flying quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives her the illusion of returning to Trier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a sunny metropolis, located in the area of ​​the River Lane and the Serenzo River. The scenery is bright, the variety of roses is numerous, and the humanities and arts are developed. A holy place for painters, musicians, and novelists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the capital of Intis, which was the first truly cosmopolitan city after the transformation of Russell the Great. It was also the hometown of Yilian. She grew up in a small place and often saw and This city where tears flow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Elaine suddenly felt that something was wrong, because the surrounding streets became more and more deserted and more and more remote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having worked as a maritime business, although she has been active in the foggy sea for a long time, she is not familiar enough with Baiyam in the Sunia Sea, but the "hunter" of Sequence 9 can She brings enough alertness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this route correct?" Elaine moved to the position and cautiously asked the driver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is always ready to jump and prepare to condense the fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coachman didn’t look back, looked at the road ahead, and smiled as he pleased:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss, this road is closer, and it is not easy to encounter blockages.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, Bayam has been built for many years, not so much at that time. People don't have so many carriages, and many streets are very narrow. Before and after noon, around the evening, it is very easy to block and walk faster than a carriage. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes? Ilan thought about it and believed this because she had encountered similar situations in many cities.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Trier is good, when Russell’s transformation of the old city, the road was expanded far and wide, even if it is today, it is enough to use...Ilan just flashed this The thought, suddenly heard the horse stallion pulling the car, it seems a bit painful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, it seems to step on something. The coachman let the carriage stop and jumped on his own.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilan didn’t think there was anything, but the corner of the eye swept away and saw that it was no one. The quiet alley.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her heartstrings are tight, and without hesitation, they will crash into the carriage and roll outside.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether this is an overreaction, she believes that it must be done.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, her heart is deep in her heart. The fear seems to be stared at by a hungry monster.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure from the spiritual level makes her hesitate and dare not act rashly .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, she heard a low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't hurt you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked some questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilan’s mind was full of thoughts and quickly weighed Various options that can be made currently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, she did not flee blindly, sitting under the pressure of great horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She intends to look at the situation and adjust her action plan a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car door opened, the thin and sturdy indigenous driver came up and sat on the opposite side of Elaine, it was the "no face" Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——In order to play as a driver, he specialized in how to control horses and vehicles. This is the technology he has not really learned in the Tinker City Night Club. In view of the urgency of time, he was not fully grasped, and he had to use the breath of “squirming hunger” and the successful horse became obedient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Daniz, who was hiding in the vicinity, ran over, took the driver's seat and drove the vehicle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His round-edged felt hat is pressed very low and dressed like a real driver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yi Lian is slightly wary and bends back, ready to save like a cheetah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels that the man’s line of sight slowly sweeps over his forehead, eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth, neck, chest, waist and legs. Seeing that she is extremely uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar gaze, a similar way of looking at it, she was seen in Intis, in Trier, during the days when I was on the sea. It is a hooligan, a disgusting guy, full of lust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
