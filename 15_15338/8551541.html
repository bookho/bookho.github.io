			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s answer made Dai Li chuckle, the translucent face with only the mouth said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if you get inspiration from the esoteric's maxim and determine your thoughts from my experience and performance, it takes only over a month to clearly recognize 'playing' and sum up your own' The Divination Code is enough to prove that you have outstanding wisdom and broad thinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t entangle the topic that made him feel guilty, instead asked道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms. Does the church executive know this, this so-called 'playing law'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "There is no doubt that they are very clear. I have read through the historical materials of the church, looking for those who are soaring and ignoring the law. I find that such a bishop is not too small. I am not the most special one. And their ending..." When it came to this, Dai Li deliberately paused, and the tone seemed to be a bit heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are the endings of them?" Klein asked, blinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Goddess of the Night Watch the "playing the law" as the temptation of the evil spirit demon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible face with no eyes and no ears suddenly smiled: "Their results are quite beautiful, except for the loss of control and sacrifice in extraordinary events. In the part, the rest are at least the archbishop or senior deacon, and there is no shortage of strong leaders who succeeded in raising the sequence. In the church of the goddess, sequence 4 and sequence 3 are collectively referred to as the saints, sequence 2 and sequence 1. It is the angel on the ground. Of course, every angel has been a saint."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...Mr. Dai Li, you just deliberately scared me... Klein's mouth was fretting, and he asked without questioning himself: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the church has mastered the law, why not tell it to everyone who is worthy of the night ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although this does not completely avoid loss of control, it can definitely reduce the corresponding probability and reduce unnecessary losses."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The translucent only mouth of the mouth has a little confusion: "I don't know why, he Let me tell you that when I become an archbishop or a senior deacon, I can understand the secrets. I am looking for you today. I hope that you will tell Dunn more clearly before submitting a special application."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t stupidly ask the other person why he didn’t do it himself, but if he thought:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Once you are noticed by the church, you must make a promise, make a vow, and don't tell others to play the law?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, in the sacred object of the goddess In front of you, swear in his name, this has enough binding force, believe me, you absolutely do not want to know the consequences of the violation, I can only talk to you who are also mastering the law, your own state is I told you the answer before you answered, so I dared to say the noun." Dai Li let the strange face sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused again and again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was only vaguely grasping the essence of the play, So I quickly digested the potion. Yes, at the top of the church, I used digestion to describe the mastery of the potion. I think this is very appropriate. In short, before I made a vow, I was told to 'play the law' before this thing Without a very clear understanding, it is impossible to accurately remind Dunn of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have given up, I did not expect to meet you, one is submitting a special Before applying, I clearly realized the miracle of 'playing the law', no, genius."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that you look at me like this, Ms.... Klein’s mouth After taking a moment, I solemnly promised: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I originally intended to remind the captain of the 'playing law' by special application, with your explanation, I don't need to worry about anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, you are such a kind guy." Tone reveals a significant relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms., you seem to be only two or three years older than me... Klein pointed out the other person’s problem in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under waiting for him to speak, the translucent and strange face continues:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you have any questions, or if you have any help, you can write to me, wait for me, huh, wait for me to become an archbishop or a senior deacon, and understand why the church hides the secret of 'playing the law', I will hint Your life is good or bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened with a spirit and asked without hesitation:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms., is your address?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, one more helper is one more, and this is relatively strong "Psychic"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Klein, who did not deny it, Dai Li was silent for a few seconds and chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Our communication should not pass through the post office, and should not use normal letters, which is very unsafe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I teach you a relatively simple Ceremonial magic, it can summon a unique spirit, belongs to my spirit, you will write a good letter to it, it will be accurately given to me, the speed is not as fast as the telegram, but faster than the steam train, you finish at noon I am in Beckland, I will receive it that night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened attentively and nodded slightly: "It is very practical ritual magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily laughed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This ritual magic is characterized by praying for itself, from itself The spiritual extraction power does not need to pass the gods, it is quite concealed, but the power is often not big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... First, you select the corresponding field Herbs, essential oils, this is no different from normal ritual magic, but the candle only needs to symbolize its own root... Then, it is the mantra part, there are three paragraphs, the first paragraph is 'I', in ancient Hermes, Giant language, dragon language or elf language shouted 'I', the second paragraph is 'I call in my name', you can use Hermes, the third paragraph is a specific description of the summoning, such as you will later Used: the spirit of the illusory, the upper-bound creature driven by the person, the messenger of Dai Li Simoni."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upper bound? In the field of occultism, this often refers to the spiritual world... Klein carefully analyzes the process of ritual while carefully remembering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, he is barely an expert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The benefit of this ritual magic is that it bypasses the gods and uses its own power to gain diversity without being restricted by the realm of the gods. The problem with the spell's effect is that it depends on its own strength, the weak is weak, the strong is strong... Klein feels that he has acquired new knowledge, which is the mystery that his current sequence cannot be lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily repeatedly described it several times, solemnly emphasizing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, don't feel free Changing the specific description of the summoner can easily lead to terrible monsters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein nodded honestly. At the same time, he suddenly thought of one thing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changed to "The fool who does not belong to this era, the mysterious ruler above the fog, the king of yellow and black who is in charge of good luck", will summon something? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it completely ineffective, or is the fog coming suddenly, or do I need to go to the mysterious space to respond? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this help me to incite more power above the fog? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this lead to a terrible chain reaction? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who had just succeeded in the "variation of the Sun's Emblem", still has fear and finally obeys the will of the heart, intends to go above the fog first. Take a chance and decide if you want to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it and asked with interest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms., if strictly used 'Playing the law', how long does it take from sequence 8 to sequence 7, and what time does it take from sequence 7 to sequence 6?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the information I have seen, Sequence 8 to Sequence 7 are available for three to two years, depending on whether you can quickly understand the core spirit and the corresponding rules in the process of playing. Sequence 7 to Sequence 6 takes six months to three years, Sequence 6 to Sequence 5 Almost, sequence 5 to sequence 4, three to twenty years..." Dai Li roughly described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
