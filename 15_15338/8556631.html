			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is dark, but there is no fog that Kleen is familiar with, the waves are coming in, blowing all the ashes, letting the sky go, Various shapes, reflecting golden red sunlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the port of Pritz, the largest and busiest port in the Kingdom of Lun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light-colored vest white shirt Klein stood by the window, staring at the outside for a while until the pocket watch rushed, and returned to the table made of wooden heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a warm fireplace, he picked up the dark black round-watered pen and spread the letter, slowly writing:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Mr. Azick:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive me for writing to you today, in the past few days, I am at Beckland, immersed in the scourge caused by the previous incident on this metropolis, if we are ordinary people, perhaps covered with white cloth, carried into the crematorium, and sheltered in a tiny box...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I waited for a long time, finally found the opportunity to retrieve my own belongings, which included my promised '亵渎牌', and another item. I will bring the messenger to you. It is a copper whistle that can summon the messenger's copper whistle. It comes from an accidental encounter and an old man who climbed from the coffin. You must be confused when you see it. Because the description I use can also point to you, this is where I don't understand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... The specific thing is like this. I suspect that the original owner of the copper whistle is trying to resurrect the members of the spiritual group of the god of death, and the level is not low. Maybe you can see something from this copper whistle...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before leaving Beckland, I wrote to 'Mechanical Hearts', describing the huge underground relics that you and Ins Zangelwell fought, hoping they can Based on this information, find out the truth behind the matter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the indirect temptation, I confirm that they are not hostile to me and you are in trouble, if you are in trouble Maybe you can try to find them to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Finally, I still have a question, is there any way to remove the mental pollution left in the extraordinary characteristics that have solidified?<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I am about to sail, I wish you a smooth journey of memory, and wish me a safe journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your student and friend, Klein Moretti."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the pen, After reading it from the beginning, Klein folded the letter paper and stuffed it into the envelope with the "black emperor" card and the copper whistle left by the members of the suspected spiritual group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he picked up the copper whistle given by Mr. Azick and summoned the messenger by blowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger is still nearly four meters high, purely made of white bones, and the eye sockets are burning with a dark flame, but Kline’s spiritual instinct tells him that this is already another messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secretly sighed, Klein raised his arm and placed the letter in the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger looked down and immediately disintegrated and turned into a bone, then fell into the ground and stormed into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Klein scorned the right tooth and turned off the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He regained his gaze back on the table, with a light yellow identification, which was necessary to purchase oceangoing tickets through the right track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, he went to find Sharon specifically, and got a new identity through the circle of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This identity belongs to the bounty hunter, a madman who wants to venture to the sea to seek wealth, according to Klein, he is called German. Spa Luo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunting sin..." Klein whispered and collected a series of documents for his new identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was still some time from the Tarot party, and Klein quickly pulled out the "squirming hunger" and put it on his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closed eyes sense the next twisted illusory soul, he tried to release the "no face". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in the real world, "squirming hunger" will happily eat this gift, and spit out the corresponding extraordinary characteristics, but above the fog It did not dare to have any impulse to let the soul of the "faceless person" leave the glove smoothly and appear on the side of the bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a vague middle-aged man, and the feeling of distortion and pain has dissipated a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struggled to give a ritual to Klein leaning against the back of his chair, his figure gradually faded and he was about to fall under the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palace, Klein can directly “psychic” without additional preparations, so he spreads spirituality, stabilizes the other side, and opens his mouth: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know where there is a living mermaid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man replied slyly道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to those raised by the Goddess of the Night, only sailing from the Gargas Islands to the depths of the Sea of ​​Sonia for at least a week can be found. My destination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out to be a "faceless person" who sought to be promoted... In order to chase the mermaid, he ventured out to sea, and he did not know how to die. The "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qi Lingus's hand... The goddess church raised a lot of mermaids? Klein asked in vain: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which organization do you belong to? Or, where does your potion recipe come from?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vague middle-aged man suddenly trembled and sounded two seconds later:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Secret Society, I Belonging to the secret meeting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Didn't the secret company raise a few mermaids? Klein considered the following: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen your leader, Charato?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Unreal and transparent "no face" is first of all silent, then the voice screams sharply: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He, he is not normal! He is an undead monster! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the speech, his figure is getting thinner and thinner, and his line will be broken.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zaratu really Still alive! What happened, so that the members of the Secret Society are so afraid of him? To be precise, you should use Him... Klein quickly asked another key question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "In addition to the treasures left by the Antignus family and the inside of your secret society, where can I get the high-ranking potion formula of the 'Divination' route? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "faceless person" is more and more transparent, more and more illusory, and ultimately only the next sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Night Goddess Church...the quiet church..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacred Hall... Klein silently looks at the "faceless man" spirit The body is completely freed, and in my heart I read a word repeatedly—the quiet church is the headquarters of the Church of the Night God, the “sacred church” in the mouth of the night.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Really hid the high-ranking potion formula of the "Divination" approach... The churches don't know how many secrets are buried and hidden... Klein's edge, the black-green gelatinous thing that condenses on the surface of the glove slides down to the bronze length The surface of the table.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary characteristics of "No Face Man" eventually form a jelly-like translucent item, with a black-green background, which sometimes looks different from time to time. The face looms wildly, like a figure hidden behind a dark curtain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked a few times Invisible micro nod, himself: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
