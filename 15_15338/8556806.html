			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the deck, an extra layer of asbestos is placed under the grill to prevent the coal Mars from being blown out by the wind and burning the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obese chef wears an apron and wears a white high hat invented by Russell. The delicate brush will not be mixed with basil, cumin and sea salt. The secret spices of pepper, lemon juice and other things are applied to the white long strips of fish and often flipped to ensure even heat on both sides. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meat of the fisherman’s stomach is full of oil and fat, and the drop of the earth falls, so that the coal under the iron net emits the sound of Ziz, and the flame is pulled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tempting scent is gradually filling, and Klein takes a sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has set up a round table and chair in front of him, with a bottle of unique wine on it, the color of the wine is golden red, and the shaking seems to be slightly sticky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sinian blood wine, made from the sweet wood juice of the region around the Golden Spring, like a thin honey mixed with blood, it tastes sweet, but very It's easy to get drunk. If you look at a lady who wants to ask her to drink, consider this. It will make the other person unknowingly drink more, haha, provided that you have enough to bear the amount of it." Ryan’s review, Captain Erlang Kage introduced half-jokingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a long-time sailor, with a joke-like literacy... Klein sat down and kept a cold attitude:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A qualified adventurer will not be addicted to alcohol."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crivis next to him nodded:< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only when you return home, adventurers are allowed to drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's a pity. "Illand turned to look at Donna and Denton, who were curious about Sunia's blood wine, and smiled. "This is not something that underage children should experience."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have drunk, really good!" Donna immediately retorted, "Just, but later fell asleep without knowing it, and slept for a whole afternoon..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember you had two drinks that time!" said the little gentleman Denton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerland did not satisfy their cravings, told the crew to give the brothers and sisters a cup of sweet iced tea, and explained casually:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are many southerners on this ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danton regained his disappointment and saw that he had been taken away The fisherman of the value material said in a naive manner: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, in fact, it is not so terrible, it is a relatively large, especially ugly, There are fish in all fours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna glances at the younger brother:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, you I finally realized the essence of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately looked at Krivis and Elland:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle, uncle, are there many such monsters at sea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fisherman has no extraordinary ability beyond imagination, in the eyes of ordinary people It is slightly equal to the beast of the sea, slightly equal to the legendary monster It was the prototype. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erland laughed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, in the main channel and the surrounding waters, similar The monsters are rare, they have been cleared up almost, and they can meet a fisherman. It is enough for you to see this creature.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You think about it, if you can often hunt down monsters worth 200 pounds or more, then I will definitely not be the captain of the passenger ship. I will organize my own fishing boat and chase these golden pounds! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes a lot of sense! Klein secretly drank.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krivis picked up the black tea that the sailor had just sent, smelled it first, and then took a sip:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only off the main channel, deep and frequent In the ocean of fog or storm, there is no chance of encountering such a monster, but it is very dangerous.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to climbing, there are scales of fish people In those seas, there are legends that the upper body is human, and the lower body is the giant Naga. They have six arms and are very agile. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerland took over this topic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is also the juice that can be eroded A huge octopus that cleans many people, a horrible sea monster with a lightly flipped over a boat, a mermaid with a singing voice, a mermaid that is no longer willing to leave, a blue dragon capable of making lightning, and a winged wing The big bird that can pick up the hurricane, huh, I have never seen these, are the legends of the sea, no one knows the true and the false. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mermaid...Klein's expression has not changed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's fun. Donna sighed with a sigh of relief.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denton looked left and right, see Klein didn’t speak, curiously asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle, you are also an adventurer. Have you seen such a monster before? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein snorted, slightly squinting:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen it once, then We have five people, one accident, one fishman, and after a fierce struggle, finally solved it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his real experience in Tingen, and his first official extraordinary face to face out of control.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, he and the old Neil helped the "Sailor" of the "Dragon Dragon Bar" owner to help clear a "sailor" who changed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Thinking of this matter, Klein has some memories, some awkwardness, and the coldness and sharpness of his face are not softened.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five people? At the same time, when the question was asked, Donna’s movements counted the number of people who had just participated in the battle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,2,3...she found the fisherman before Only three uncles started.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Klein replied, Ellaland spoke strangely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Unexpectedly encountered? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Klein answered calmly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there a casualty? "Erlan asked a question.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some minor injuries. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unexpectedly, only one person solved a fisherman with five people...you are very powerful." Krivis gave his own evaluation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His partner Cecil also nodded his head to show his surprise.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle was short and quick, the fisherman seemed to be vulnerable, but she and Krivis knew very well that without the pre-prepared bait, there would be no magical effect of peppercorns and After the exhaustion, there is no fatal threat to the fisherman by the mint cream. There are no borrowed two rifles. I don’t know how many people will die to kill a fisherman.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Really, very powerful. "Alan looked at Klein thoughtfully.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a four-sequence 9, a sequence of 8 teams... Klein half laughs Half sigh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was very young at the time, and I didn't even experience any fighting, just pure assistance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle, you are young now!" Donna tried hard to point her head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, several crew members came up with a ceramic plate with fried fish to the golden color, and the color of the basil leaves, the smell of the hook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erland picked up the cup of Sunia blood wine and published a toast:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "A wonderful night, the storm is with us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good night!" Donna and Denton cheered and each drank sweetly iced tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein chose to touch the other party with a black tea cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He forked a piece of meat from the fish ribs, only to feel it firm and firm, no fat, but after absorbing the vegetable oil, the shortcomings of being too dry were made up It exudes endless elasticity and meaty flavor in chewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s worse than the cheeks at the moment, but it’s good enough to beat all the fish I have eaten in Beckland and Port Pritz... Klein Satisfied with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aylan put down the knife and fork in his hand and drank the wine of Sunia, sighing on the topic just now:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At sea, the most dangerous are not monsters, but those pirates.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are driving the ship, thinking about where to go No one can prepare for it in advance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain Uncle, will we meet pirates?" "Denton swallowed the fried fish and asked with some concern.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerland laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The route to the Rhodes Islands is the safest in the world. Colonies can be docked every two or three days, and ships from the Royal Navy and Storm Church are often patrolled along the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if there are gangs of pirates roaming here, they will not do too much. After seeing our artillery, they will most often extort some compensation." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the peace of two underage children, Airland added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But from the south of the Rothde Islands, or to the east, we have to rely on the Lord's blessing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many pirates are active in these areas, with naval and church ships If you are lucky, we will arrive at the South Continent very smoothly and arrive at every place. But if you are not lucky enough, you will encounter quite powerful pirates, including the seven pirate generals and even the four kings' fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, you don't have to worry too much. Since Nast became the 'King of the Five Seas', after making some rules for passing the sea, most of the pirates It will also ruin your money and will not make too much.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this, we are most afraid of encountering the captain of the 'Black Tulip' , 'Hell Admiral' Ludwig, he will let his men kill all the people on the boat, throw these innocents into hell, followed by 'blood on the top' Senigal, he loves blood, indulge his subordinates All the bad deeds, many girls were smashed by them, and they were sold to different islands..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna heard a shudder and subconsciously shifted the subject: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that I heard that there are many treasures on the sea! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are legends of treasures, but most of them are fake. "Alan looked at Krivis and looked at it. "The story is the most, the six are the most famous. The first place is the 'key of death'. It is rumored that at the end of the Quaternary, the god of death caused by the pale disaster is seven. God killed, but did not fall on the spot, trying to return to the Southland, He picked up the violent storms, created an insurmountable obstacle, completely cut off the navigation channel of the North and South continent, this is the source of the violent sea, but he did not return to the South. The mainland disappeared into the ocean. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Elland sighs somewhat: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said to be in violent In a hidden place in the sea, the treasure left by the god of death is waiting for someone with a specific key to find and open it, but what the key looks like, where it will appear, no one knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
