			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is danger in the hotel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein whispered divination and entered meditation, Gold coins popped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint but clear voice echoed in the quiet room, and the gold coins rolled down and fell on Klein's palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the number is up, indicating no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No danger... Klein frowned and looked around, pulling out the bottle of essential oil from the coat on the coat rack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sprinkled a circle around him, quickly reversed four steps, entered the fog, and made a positive divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a ten-second effort. He got the revelation and it’s still no danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the real world, Klein shook his head, put back coins and bottles, put on jackets, pants and boots, sat on the edge of the bed, leaning back on the pillow, Caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still remembers his "Divination Code", especially "Divination is not a panacea", so even if the answer is very safe, he does not dare Relax and continue to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that he does not believe in the ability of fog to shield interference, but that there are too many possibilities, and that his own divination statement may not be accurate and may result in Interpret the error. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has some speculations about what he just did, that is, the adventurer’s four-person group in the restaurant did find it in the original jungle of Symi Island. The abandoned and forgotten ancient temples harvested wealth or artifacts, but also alarmed the corresponding, lingering evil spirits, entangled in evil thoughts or curses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time passed by, and Klein suddenly felt that some subtle spiritual fluctuations spread out from the nearby room and quickly blended into the darkness around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undercurrent, the undercurrent that made him a little noticed disappeared, and the tranquility of the night returned completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough...there is extraordinary ability...is this solved? Wait a second, anyway, it will be an hour or two to be bright... What is the problem? There is also a church and a squad of "the punishers"... Klein half-closed his eyes and started to meditate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Yam, Fragrant Leaf Bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz, who made up his mind to fool the monitor, said, "Den Lang Qi", drunkly watching the girls on the boxing ring jumping hot and sexy dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shit! There is no shortage of clothes for so long!" He shouted loudly with other drunks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, regardless of whether they responded or not, they laughed at each other, touched a cup, and poured a strong drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Read the newspaper?" A man who was still in the bar late at night had a long embarrassment and said to his companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have your brain been smashed? Do you think that you think I can understand the twisted letters? The storm is on, I only Interested in this twisted and twisted! Hahaha!" The companion raised the glass and pointed at the dancing girls, laughing at the self-confidence of humor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previously spoken man slammed his head back:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Steel' Dead!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was killed by 'flame flames'! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearby Daniz is a glimpse, then sit up straight and slightly sideways.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cleared his throat and poured a strong drink, seemingly innocent, but secretly moved to the other side, trying to hear how others evaluated this matter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The adventurer and pirate who brought him into the line once said that if there is no spirits, women and bragging, the life at sea will be meaningless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Steel? What steel? I told you, when I was young, I once defeated a steel pipe!" Another drunkard interjected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you do to the steel pipe? Should I say it, oh, you are so fine!" The man who spoke first revealed "I understand "The smile." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not wait to answer, said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Steel' Mavier died "The second of the blood will be dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last half of his sentence is low, scared that one is standing still The guy slipped to the bottom of the table and screamed in horror:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not me, not what I did..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Dog! The bar is always so messy! Come on, let's get into the theme, I am waiting for you to praise the "flame" adults! Disguised Deniz could not wait to throw the wine glass in his hand to the gang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The newspaper said that the navy and the church did it together. 'Steel' died, 'Bloody thorns' died, and calm Scull died. John Smith’s gangster was also caught!” A still awake drunkard squeezed over and joined the topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, the truth is not like this!" The man who first mentioned this topic smiled and shook his head. "I have friends at the newspaper, he told me that they There is exact news, but it cannot be published. The navy and the church are only the objects of exploitation. The real murderer is 'flame' Daniz and a mysterious, sophisticated, powerful adventurer and bounty hunter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible!" Flames Daniz can't win 'Steel', even if it is a sneak attack, he can't do it!" A similar point of view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The focus is on that powerful adventurer, I suspect this is an adventurer close to the level of the pirate general!" The man who dominated the topic stressed, "I don't know Where did Daniz know such a guy, oh, he also made a contribution, it is said that 'Bloody Thorns' is what he killed! Didn't you pay attention? The reward of 'flame' changed, and the bounty mentioned 4200 pounds. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Flame' is not simple!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a fierce pirate, no, big pirate!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The big pirate? When I was drinking with him last time, I really didn't see it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呸! When did you raise this scorpion, when did I drink with you? I don't know you at all! In amazement, Daniz thought with enthusiasm: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4200 pounds! If the guys know, they will definitely envy the night to clean the deck, hahaha, I can now say that the "golden dream" is the strongest sailor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Daniz can't wait to fly back to the boat, and the guys like "iron" and "bucket" drink and brag, talk about the horror of Banxi, talk about it. I talked about how I defeated the fallen bishop, how to escape from the ambush of "steel" and other people, how to set a trap to empty the enemy, and no longer play this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, for the captain, you have to continue to be the servant of the madman Spallo Sparrow... Hey, I am already a big pirate of 4,200 pounds. ! Daniz sighed and kept himself paralyzed with alcohol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bell of the storm church ringing, the horizon rises orange The yellow sun is still quiet enough to hear the sound of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without waiting for the exception, Klein sighed and took off his clothes and returned to the bed to make up for more than two hours of sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirituality is counted as strong. He woke up at the scheduled 8:30, slowly washed and changed clothes, and went to the first floor to buy bread with cooked chestnuts. A cup of "eucalyptus sap", while eating, walked to the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he had already bought a 9-point return passenger ship when he arrived, Kline had time to prepare for boarding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, he saw the lady with blue-gray eyes and the three male adventurers of her team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are buying tickets at the ticket office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get on the boat soon, they must have been unable to catch up at 9:00... They don’t know what they took from the abandoned temple, and they brought it last night. There is the existence of evil spirits. When you take the passenger ship, don't be surprised... Klein blocked the sights of the adventurers with his body and took out the gold coins to make a divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revelation he received was that there was no danger in the passenger liner behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein hesitated for two seconds and looked at the passengers waiting for the passenger ship at 10 o'clock near the ticketing point. The fingers were silent and lit the ticket in the palm of the hand. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the ticketing point as if nothing happened, and spent 4 Sule to buy a ticket for the passenger liner at 10 o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he went to the dock bathroom, entered the fog, and then quickly divined the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought very clearly, if the result shows that there are great hidden dangers, then he will not venture to board the ship, but find a way to stop the boat, if necessary Invisibly destroy the ship and prevent the innocent from dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is consistent with the divination of the previous divination, he will ride normally, just to prevent accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the answer is no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein breathed a sigh of relief and went straight back to the real world, adjusting the position of the fisherman to the most convenient place to come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an accident, and above the sea, this extraordinary material will be very important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Extraordinary materials can also be applied initially, simply like the "all-black eye" polluted by the "real creator." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German Sparo-like Klein lifted the suitcase and followed the adventurer and boarded the passenger liner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, he seems to be on a fake, or read the expired newspapers and magazines on board, but in fact he has been paying attention to the lady with blue eyes and her companions . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of vigilance continued to the port of Baiam, with no accidents in between. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They solved all the problems? What did they get? Klein stopped at the roadside and bought the latest newspaper from the newsboy. He used the eyes of the eye to send the four adventurers away until they disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein decided not to think about this matter anymore, as long as it didn’t harm the big environment, he didn’t care what those people did, just a little bit curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his suitcase, flipped through the newspaper, and walked toward the sour lemon street, like an ordinary passerby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, he snorted and laughed at himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Daniz The amount of the reward rose to 4,200 pounds..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, he wondered if he couldn’t help but hand over the guy to the Governor’s Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk back to the "Azure Wind" hotel, Klein has not yet taken out the key, he heard a wave of high-pitched snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t escape? Klein was a little surprised, but not too unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to move his hands on the "shadow cloak". As long as Daniz left, he could use the means of divination to track each other and find "icebergs." Lieutenant General." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although timid, but still cautious... Klein opened the door and looked at the awakened Deniz, a little bit of a corner:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, Mr. 4200."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
