			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the two white-skinned middle-aged men drank a cup of tea and smiled and sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Actually, this is much better than before, better than many people here, such as..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the window and shrank in the corner Wanderers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and Mike followed and saw a raging tramp lying in a dirty place that could shelter from the wind, male and female, old There are also small ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this cold autumn, they may not be able to wake up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein noticed that the old lady in her 60s stood on the street. Her dress was old and broken, but she was relatively neat and her hair was reasonable. I have to be meticulous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white-haired old lady has a common trampoline on her face, but she still insists on not rushing with the pile of people, but slowly On the side of the road, I look at the cafe from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also a poor man." The former tramp who ate the remaining black bread also found the old lady and sighed a few words. "She It used to be said to be a good life. Her husband is a food merchant and has a very spiritual child. Unfortunately, she went bankrupt. Her husband and children did not take long to die. She is different from us. Really, I can see it at a glance... ...hey, she shouldn’t be able to support it for a long time, unless she can go to the poor house every time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening, Mike’s expression changed from calm to depression. He slowly vomited: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to ask her for an interview. Can you invite her for me? She can eat whatever she wants here. What to drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this request, the middle-aged man is not surprised, just look at Klein and Mike, as if to say, you Sure enough, my colleague. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I think she will be very happy." He drank the tea and got up and walked out of the greasy coffee shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the old but neat old lady walked in with him, and the white face faded slightly under the warmth of the cafe. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She kept trembled, seemingly to shed a little bit of chill in the body and grab the relatively high temperature in the cafe, even if she sat in a chair, she It took more than a minute to fully relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want to do, this is the reward for the interview." Klein said to Mike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Mike nodded, the old lady held the toast, the inferior cream and the coffee, and then smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven't been able to eat greasy things when I haven't heard of food for too long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very polite, very homemade, just a little Unlike the wanderers... Klein sighed silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the food was delivered, Mike asked at random:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can talk about you How do you become a wanderer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old lady reveals the look of memories, bitterly laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "My husband is a food trader, mainly buying food from domestic farmers. Since the "Crops Act" was abolished, we quickly went bankrupt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "His age is not small, he was knocked down by this thing, his body quickly collapsed, and he died soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My child, He is a good young man who has been doing business with his father. He can't accept such a blow, so he jumped into the Tsock River on a night without a moon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "His first suicide was unsuccessful and he was sent to the Magistrate’s Court. The police and the judges were very impatient and felt that he had delayed their time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbs p;&nbsp;"My child was put in jail. It didn't take long for him to commit suicide for the second time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old lady said very calmly, like that Not something that I have encountered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Klein felt a strong sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mourning is greater than death... He suddenly remembered the sentence he had heard in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, suicide is not only a prohibited behavior of the major churches, but also a subject of legal punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the reason, Klein knows what it is. First of all, suicides choose to invest in the river. In the absence of timely discovery, there is a certain probability that Water ghosts, secondly, the suicides' emotions are often very wrong. In this state, ending their lives as "sacrificial offerings" may resonate with some strange and terrible existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the body of their death or some of the items around them will carry a strange curse that harms others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "good luck puppet" behind the Tunisian gate in Tingen is probably the way it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the Seven Great Churches are starting from their own teachings, prohibiting believers from committing suicide, and the royal family has promoted the corresponding legislation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this seems a bit ridiculous in Klein. A person who wants to commit suicide will be afraid of the law and punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike brushed and recorded what was being said, but the owner of the cafe had already brought the food over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You fill your stomach first, let's talk about it." Mike pointed to the toast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." The old lady was eating very little food and was very educated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t have much, she soon finished eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reluctantly drinking the last bite of coffee, she licked her forehead and pleaded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I sleep for a while before I talk? It's too cold outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Mike replied without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old lady gratefully said a few thanks, sitting in a chair, just curled up and slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike looks to the middle-aged man next to him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem familiar with this place I want to ask you to be our guide, how about 3 Soler a day? Sorry, forget to ask your name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man is busy Shaking his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, this is too much, I am at the pier, many times, only one year of Sule's income."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You call me old Kohler."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, two Soules a day, this is what you deserve Mike. The hammer is fixed. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw this strange bargaining, smashed some nose with paper, and tried to refill the coffee, but suddenly he noticed that it was wrong, and turned to look at the contraction. Old lady sleeping on a chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has become a lot of ruddy face because she drank coffee, and the color and mood of the gas field have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Klein stood up and subconsciously explored the old lady's breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the strange eyes of Mike and Kohler, he said heavily:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is dead. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike opened his mouth and couldn't say anything. Kohler clicked three times on his chest and smiled bitterly:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the Eastern District, this happens every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least she filled her stomach and died in a warm place, hope, huh, I hope that I will This can be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was silent for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Kohler, you go to the police Come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Kohler once again ran out of the chest and ran out of the cafe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss looked at this side and didn’t come over. It seems that this is not something that needs too much attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, a policeman wearing a black and white uniform, carrying a short stick and not holding a pistol entered the cafe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the dead old lady and asked Mike and Klein a little, and he waved:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's okay, you can wait until I find someone to take the body away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it?" Mike stunned Out of voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is obviously not familiar with the Eastern District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policeman snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of thing, the East District has a lot of every day ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his eyes and looked at Klein and Mike:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not like It’s the people here, what is it? What identity?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike took out the press card and Klein said he was protecting his private detective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police suddenly got a face and looked at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I doubt You are illegally holding a gun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to search your belongings, please cooperate, otherwise it will be regarded as a resist!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike became worried because he knew that private detectives were generally illegally armed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein spread his hand in a blank expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the police search, but the other party found nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old lady’s body was sent away, the disappointed policeman left, and Mike grabbed his fist and slammed the table:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A living person died here, but he only wanted to check illegally holding a gun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of here, Mike Looking sideways at Klein, wondering: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't bring a gun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Ryan shook his head and pulled the gun bag and the revolver from under the table, calmly saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As a detective, I have a lot of experience in this area." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a "magician", he can put a pistol in front of the other party, but let the other party not find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, because he did not buy ordinary bullets, the extraordinary bullet was temporarily thrown into the fog, his revolver is currently empty, but this does not hinder him. Shooting with a pistol, you only need to simulate a "beep" with your mouth when you pull the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, the old Kohler whispered next to him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a detective." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
