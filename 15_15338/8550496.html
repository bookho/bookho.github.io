			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called "interrupted" ritual magic means that when the extraordinary person holds the ceremony, he can interrupt according to the situation, complete other things first, and wait until he is busy, then return. Continue and still get the effect you want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a technique derived from the millennial development of ritual magic. After all, many high-level rituals require many steps, which may take an hour, two hours. Even half a day can be completed, it is difficult to ensure that no one else is disturbing, no accidents happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a bloody and tearful lesson of an ancestor, after repeated failures of feedback, the ritual magic that can be "interrupted" becomes mainstream at a high level, and indirectly affects the low The part of the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the ability to "interrupt" does not mean when you want to interrupt, when can you interrupt, how to interrupt if you want to interrupt, you must follow the mysterious theory, master the corresponding The skill, otherwise the ritual failure is an inescapable ending, and even leads to a horrible counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Klein’s understanding, when you succeed in gaining the attention of a certain god, when he waits for you to say the content of the petition, you suddenly come to a sentence Wait, I will go to the bathroom first, then congratulations, you will never need to go to the bathroom again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein breathed a sigh of relief and kept himself calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has held several “transfer ceremonies” and designed corresponding processes to try “justice” and “downside down”, but true, The ritual magic that meets the regulations is still the first practice today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the silver-plated cane on the edge of the bed, Klein picked up the third candle and placed it in the center of the desk to symbolize himself. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he put Selena’s ceremony in front of the third candle in a silver bowl, instead of the big kettle with the emblem, the left side contains The pure dew and essential oil of plants such as moon flowers and deep sleep flowers, the right side is a dish of salt, a small silver plaque, a parchment paper, and a water-stained feather pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Selena’s things are quite complete, otherwise there is really no way to complete the arrangement, and the old ritual of the fast is not a “divination”. ... It seems that Selena is a more senior occult enthusiast... ah, not a senior, can’t make such a disaster... She’s only sixteen years old, contact this for at least a year. Ok... Who brought her to the door? Klein thought about flying, picking up Selena's cup from the bedside, pouring it into clean water and placing it next to the coarse salt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take out the pocket watch, slammed it open and glanced at it. He didn’t delay, sketching the layers of light balls in his mind and quickly entered meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an invisible wind swirling in the room where the flowers were swaying. The Klein eyelids that had closed the pocket watch turned deep, from brown to black, like Can see the soul of every gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out his palm and reached the candle in the upper right corner, silently in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The goddess of the night, you are the master of blush!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meditation, Klein extended spirituality, rubbing the wick, and after many times, the candle was so It was ignited, and the dim light was accompanied by a slightly quiet light blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goddess of the night, you are also the queen of embarrassment and fear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the previous method Klein smoothly lit the second candle in the upper left corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am your faithful guard, a shield against danger in the dark, a spear that spurs evil in silence!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teng! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third candle that symbolizes Klein begins to burn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the slightest swaying candlelight, he picked up the silver knife and imitated the manners of the old Neil, completing the holy with the mantra and coarse salt and clear water. Chemical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he let his own spirituality emancipate from the tip of the silver enamel, blending with nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a silver knife, Klein walked around the bedroom (the position of the bed, he replaced his feet with his knees), letting the invisible The barriers are sealed here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light from the street lights disappeared instantly, but the blush was still quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein returned to his desk, picked up the quill, and used the spirit of the ink to paint the spells and symbols to avoid the affliction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he put down the things in his hands and dripped a few bottles of pure dew, flower essence and essential oil into three candles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint mist filled the room, and the room suddenly felt a little more mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In turn, several herbs were burned, and Klein took a step back in the mixed scent and mourned the mantra of the "interrupted" ritual magic: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The night goddess who are more noble than the stars, longer than eternal;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray Your patronage;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for your loyal followers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I pray for the power of blush;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for the power of embarrassment and fear;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Pray that you will let your faithful follower Selena Wood get out of the evil and get rid of the entanglement of the affliction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for you, wait a moment, wait for that Unfortunate girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moon flowers, herbs belonging to the Red Moon, Please pass the power to my spell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Deep sleep, the herbs that belong to the Red Moon, please pass the power to my curse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the mantra, Klein closed his eyes and repeated it seven times in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no abnormality in the altar. He took the silver plaque again and stepped back and retreated to Selena’s bedroom door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drew four times on the chest, drew a blushing month, then turned his body and raised the silver plaque. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirituality once again spurted out from the tip, cutting the shape of the door on the invisible wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein knows that at this time, even if you open the door, it will not affect the peace and holiness of the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a silver pocket watch with a vine pattern, checked the time, and previewed the follow-up process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth, who was slightly shuddering, looked up at the wall clock from time to time, and counted the time in the light of two gas lamps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost... She whispered silently, looking sideways at the lively girl with long red hair, the dimples were deep, the smiles were brilliant, and the surrounding Every friend can talk very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more this is the case, the more Elizabeth feels fear, the cold and terrible "Selina" in the mirror seems to always exist in her mind, it is difficult to forget . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t wait any longer! Must act! Elizabeth Horan stood up and laughed in the strange eyes of everyone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Selina, I, I have a surprise for you, for you, You go out with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really? Have you sent a birthday present?" Selena took the mirror back and felt it. I got up in a strange way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Surprise is, no, there will be no, any signs." Elizabeth felt that she had no performance talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not say that when she first walked to the door of the living room, Selena smiled and followed behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa watched as the two friends left, and the brow wrinkled unconsciously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth today is so strange...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she met Klein, it was even more strange...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just ran out and said that she was in a hurry to the bathroom Why can the expression look so flustered...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina Bedroom doorway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth took a deep breath and said to the girl in front:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We entered your room. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elizabeth, I feel that you are nervous, very scared, why?" Selena looked at her friend inexplicably and found that her body could not stop. Trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excited, right, excited!" Elizabeth glanced at the mirror in Selena's hand, half-turning her body and knocking on the door, one long and two short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why knock on the door..." Selena was even more awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, her bedroom door was opened, and Klein, wearing a black tuxedo and wearing a half-height silk hat, appeared in front of the two girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surprise? Is this a surprise?" Selina had a half-mouth and her head was confused. At this time, Klein suddenly probed, grabbed her wrist and pulled her into the room, seeing Elizabeth squatting in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Klein Silver Pointed out, sprayed with spirituality, and quickly compensated for the cut-out portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible spiritual wall once again sealed the room and hid Selena’s scream inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slammed the door shut and didn't look at Selena and rushed back to the front of the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl with long burgundy hair stopped screaming, raised her head and looked around the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her gaze quickly became cold, the skin was a little pale, and the fingers flew out of the white nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein returned to the state of meditation, and dropped a drop of the essential oil of the moon flower to each of the three candles, and whispered: /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lord of the blush, the great emperor and the queen of fear;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for you "Let's fall down;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at your lost lamb Selena Wood!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse In the sound of the text, he picked up the parchment and put it to the candle that symbolizes the petitioner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt the cold wind behind him and felt the heavy force coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parchment was ignited, and Klein threw it into a silver bowl, and he was shortly prepared to avoid the deadly catch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind became extremely fierce, and Klein felt that his own spiritual tide was pouring out and could not be stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the parchment in the silver bowl burned out of the quiet darkness, and heard the movement of heavy objects falling behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! Pang when! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two sounds with almost no gaps, a black and green invisible gas was thrown into the silver bowl and disappeared into the illusion of deep black. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein halfway to the side, got up and pulled out the left wheel of his arm, but he stared and saw only the cute girl race with long red hair Linna fell to the ground, and the silver-plated mirror fell into countless pieces on the blanket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
