			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought she would be very contemptuous to say that she doesn’t like very naive, people who are incapable of their own, implied that they don’t look like ordinary people, who knows, she Even this question does not bother to answer... Oh, this kind of superior mentality is also very easy to lead to the loss of control when the promotion is later... Kline can't help but swear in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his cognition, the extraordinary person is just a human being with extra power, which is equivalent to being rich and very important. In essence, there are still human beings. Attributes, can not be separated from the society, must go to the sequence 4, only to be qualitative. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, most of the demigods are also active in human society, even the sequence 1 "Destiny Snake" Will Anthony is doing well. Unborn fetuses... Perhaps only at this stage of the "God of God" Amon, can you really look at the real world with the eyes of "God"... Kline’s thoughts turn and take the initiative to speak:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I used to be a businessman who traveled frequently between the North and the South, and didn't have much dance experience. Oh, I mean this dance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter." Hairouer calmly responded, seemingly does not care whether the other party has raised the topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For someone else, I don’t know how to chat with this proud girl at this time, only to focus on dancing, but Klein can now count as He has extensive knowledge and experience. He has a good understanding of the different extraordinary people in the mysterious world. Following the apology just now, he smiles and says:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is for me. It is not a simple challenge than the sea. It also has beautiful scenery and numerous hidden difficulties. Of course, there are still stories of various treasures in the sea. Some of them are obviously fake, and some sound like It's real, but it can't be verified, like the number one 'key of death'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The key to death?" Haiful raised his head. Looking at the eyes of Dao, Mr. Tang Taisi, who is much higher than himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, this extraordinary person with a strong sense of superiority is always interested in things involving mystery... Klein smirked and nodded lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the rumor is in a hidden place in the raging sea..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will be at the beginning The treasure tale that was heard on the "White Onyx" was mentioned one by one, with additional details that were heard in subsequent adventures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, he inevitably mentioned the "four kings" and seven pirate generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heilour is obviously interested in this, rarely responding to Klein, and even occasionally asking questions, which makes the dance between the two people no longer embarrassed, I do not know The feeling came to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein skillfully ended the previous topic and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Go back to the place just now, or go there and get some food?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a dance, the man must follow the lady’s wishes and send her The place she wants to go is not necessarily where she was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heiluer opened his mouth and seemed to want to ask something, but eventually did not say those words, and nodded and nodded:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The place just now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘿嘿, she’s obviously a bit sad about the story at sea... this is a big one Bear child, as long as the temper is fixed, and the hobby is found, it is not so difficult to get along with... Klein endured the smile and sent Hairouer back to the edge of the dance floor, where she was standing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for himself, of course, he is pretending to go to a long table with a variety of foods, pick up a plate, and clip it to himself. A portion of the sautéed keel fish served with a sliced ​​schnitzel with black pepper sauce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food is the essence of the party compared to dancing and entertainment... Klein thought as he tried to make his own eating movement look elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw Mrs. Mary walk over and forked a piece of red wine foie gras to the plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what to call you? I haven't seen you at the banquets and dances held by Mr. Maht." Perhaps it is to see Dawn. Dontes's horns are white, blue eyes are deep, very attractive, shin bones. Mrs. Mary, who is a taller general, volunteered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a businessman who just came from Desi Bay En. Dontes, I live in this neighborhood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms., I am fortunate to know your name? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary thought thoughtfully, and it was clear that this was a businessman who tried to squeeze into the upper class, just like the past.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiles and says:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mary Schott, director of Coim. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not mention that she is the largest shareholder of Coyim, nor did she say that she is currently a member of the Air Pollution Investigation Committee. This is Lun’s implicitness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary. Short, is this a return to the father's surname? Yes, she has divorced... Klein whispered silently and said with a smile:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know this company, which specializes in anthracite and premium charcoal, has expanded very rapidly in recent months. Oh, frankly, I have an intention to invest, but it seems to be competitive. other people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the introduction of the Air Pollution Related Act, the demand for anthracite and high-quality charcoal has increased, and Coim has been developed beyond the efforts of many years. The overall value is said to have been More than 250,000 gold pounds. Kline's intention to invest is not casual, but I feel that this line will become more important in the next few years until humans find alternative energy.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary has been proud of her own report on the promotion of air pollution, and has been very proud of the long-term development of Coim, which is difficult to say with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is because everyone is paying more and more attention to the environment in which they live. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, she sighed slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" At the same time, the trouble is getting more and more. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of "just", Klein didn't ask any trouble, and before I knew Mrs. Mary, I easily found the topic of interest to the other party, let two People talked quite happily.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, her attitude towards Sherlock Moriatti and Dawn Dontes is very different... The person who was familiar with it changed his face and changed his identity. Standing in front of her, he got a brand new treatment. Without a problem, this feeling is really wonderful... Chatting and chatting, Klein After a while, I felt that the "No Face" potion that I used to eat was quickly digested.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, a handsome man with brilliant blonde hair I came over with a glass of red wine and smiled at Madame Mary: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mary, what are you talking about? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hilbert, this is Mr.Donnes from Desi, and his experience at Seaside in the West is really interesting. "Mary immediately introduced the two, "Dow, this is Mr. Hibbert Hall, the eldest son of Count East Chester, huh, we should have called him Lord, but he wants us to call his chief secretary. Chief Secretary of the Air Pollution Investigation Committee. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard you say, of course, when Sherlock Moratti is active... Earl of East Chester, this is the big nobility The real top of society... Klein respects but does not humble the way: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please allow me to express my gratitude as an ordinary person, Air Pollution Survey The work of the committee allowed us to have a better living environment. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert Hall was delighted by this sincere thank you, responded with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the effort of all of us. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
