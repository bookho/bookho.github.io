			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private detective agency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr., your commission is completed." Private detective Henry of the wine cellar looks at the front wearing a black tuxedo, wearing a half-height silk hat and a dark mask. The gentleman, relieved, "This is really an easy task. It is not difficult, but it takes us too much energy. Frankly speaking, I regret very much. I regret that the price was too low before I regret it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no matter what you say, I won’t pay even one penny extra! Klein emphasized in his heart that he pointed to a thick stack of documents on the coffee table. "Is this the investigation report?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Henry press I lived at least 60 pages of the investigation report and sighed, "This is the most troublesome thing I have ever done..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s not falling, he saw Klein Four four-pound notes were handed over, and the attention was shifted to discerning seriousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the end of the whole." Klein reached for the thick investigation report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry coughed two channels:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are an honest and trustworthy gentleman, hey, I didn't think that the survey report would use so much paper at the beginning, completely outside my budget."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Klein picked up That very thick investigation report, brushed up and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a little embarrassed and immediately put a cane to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The follow-up words of Henry Detective were blocked in the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, how can I pay for the paper cost of the survey report? This is included in the overall commission fee! Klein touched the remaining 5 pounds and 8 solers, and snorted in his heart and walked quickly to Besik Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first observed the surroundings, confirmed that no one was paying attention to himself, only to leave here with speed, and to find a chance to solve the mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t plan to go home now, but was ready to find a coffee shop nearby, and quickly sorted out the investigation report to find out in his divination to the red chimney After that, there are those houses where the tenants are replaced, and then the time before the dinner is checked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are quite a few cafes in the neighborhood, but almost none of them meet Klein’s requirements - since steam and machinery have become a symbol of the times, more and more The cafe has lowered its style and turned into a cheap restaurant. It provides busy workers with tea, coffee, bread, toast, and tender pea stewed lamb, so decent gentlemen and ladies. Instead of going to the cafe to talk about things, no longer a symbol of this behavior, a variety of clubs began to appear, replacing the social function of the original cafe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Klein finally found a café with a good environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sitting in the hidden corner deck, he sipped his mouth and only needed three and a half pennies of Nanwei coffee, carefully opened it. Investigation report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...In the North, East, West, South, Jintongtong, Dock and University areas of Tingen City, a total of 1,179 houses have dark red Chimneys... On the outskirts of Tingen, there are 546 houses with the red chimneys described by the employer...this does not include the towns and villages that belong to Tingen but are relatively far away.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The following is the address of each home and the corresponding landlord and tenant information, according to the employer's request, the situation in the last three months has been collected in more detail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein swept through the pages and kept using the pen to make notes on the paper he was carrying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he found that after his divination to the "red chimney", there were a total of twenty-five houses with tenant changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not too much, try to check in two days, um, I saw the red chimney in the dream divination, I saw part of the house, As long as the reality encounters again, it will inevitably produce spiritual familiarity, thus confirming the goal. In short, I am the human flesh checker..." Klein silently beheaded, according to the location of the house, the ten that I am going to plan today. Five places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for whether such an action is dangerous, he does not need divination to get an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the tenant change has occurred, it means that the fate of the accident is not coordinated, and the black hand behind the coincidence event has always left! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to know the way the former tenant looks from the landlord’s mouth...but, since the guy hiding behind the scenes can affect my destiny unconsciously Let coincidence seem to appear naturally, there will definitely be ways to eliminate the traces of its own existence... Hey, can only pray for the goddess, let the guy appear a certain omission... Klein breathed a sigh of relief, forcibly cheered up, put on Silk hat, got a cane and a report, got up and walked out of the cafe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he spent 2 Soul hired a two-wheeled rental carriage and ran the fifteen houses with red chimneys before dinner. It is a pity that it is not the one he saw in his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If tomorrow's investigation is still the result, things will be troublesome. He still lives in the red chimney house that was previously divined by me... this either indicates He has enough confidence, is not afraid of my tracing, not even afraid of the arrest of the night-time squad of the Tingen market, or that he does not know that he is exposed, and then against my divination is a power that does not belong to him completely... Klein stood at the door of No. 2 Narcissus Street and analyzed the possibility of one after another.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, he patted the dust on the black tuxedo. Pressed the half-height silk hat on the top of the head, pulled out the bronze key, and opened the door with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intends to give Benson and May tonight Lisa prepares lamb and honey for roasting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 pm The three brothers and sisters who had good nights entered each other's bedroom.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed the door Standing at the desk, the light of the gas lamp looked out of the window. At this time, the nearby neighborhood was dark, only a few street lights were guiding the direction, and the stars at high altitude were set on the black curtain, one by one. Point, not clear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what it means to be the 'land of hope', what is the Beckland of 'the capital of the capital'..." Ryan whispered silently, reaching for the curtain and getting ready to pull.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, a cold wind blew through without warning, and the light of the gas lamp suddenly became cloudy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a few steps back, very There was a professional instinct to make the left tooth twitch twice, at the same time, he slammed against the bed and tried to take the pistol under the pillow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In his sight, under the gas lamp, on the wall above the desk, Huo Ran highlighted a face, no eyes, no nose, only a translucent face of the mouth! Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not shoot. "The face is open and mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can communicate? Klein has taken the gun and aimed at the target.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do? He asked in a deep voice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face made a chuckle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Dai Li. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily? "Psychic" Dai Li? The "Psychic" Dylan Klein, who was transferred to the Beckland Parish, frowned: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Dai Li? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that such visits are too rude, I should let you know in advance, so that you are fully prepared, but I am not convenient to directly with you now. Meet, you can only communicate with you through this little guy. "The translucent, eyeless, no-nosed face laughed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the voice was wrong, it was so harsh, but it was indeed the style of Ms. Dai Li’s speech..." The ability of the Psychic is really cool... Klein secretly sighed and asked without hesitating:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms., you want What do you communicate with me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I were you, I would first seal the bedroom with spirituality, otherwise your family would think that your spirit is problematic." "Semi-transparent strange face jokingly said, "Oh, you don't need to be so alert, I just sent a letter from Dunn to Tingen secretly. You know, the night-timers can't leave their own jurisdiction." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
