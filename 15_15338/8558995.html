			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the white body is huge, growing a lot of tumors and flowers, like a strange tree of Cynthia, hearing her shy and low-lying request, Klein I couldn't help but shudder, and the roots were all erected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene has a horror that transcends human imagination, even in a dream, he has never seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Meigen’s meeting in Meigen, Klein will definitely be affected by similar pictures, reacting to short-term loss of fear and panic The ability, but after experiencing so many things, he is a veteran of the real sense of the veteran, while Cynthia's words are in the ear, his left palm gloves quietly changed color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It becomes dark, with a sense of dignity and sorrow, which means that Klein has opened "squirming hunger" and switched to "smart" "Missor's soul, incarnate as "corrupted baron"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, he "distorted" Cynthia’s words and turned "General, I want to have a child with you" into "General, I only want Have a child with you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Klein believes that the members of the General Guard and the male waiters who surround the tree-like monsters will inevitably be distorted by the willingness of Cynthia to open and lose. Go to the distance and get a chance to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to whether this will reveal that he is not really a problem with Admiral Amyrius, he does not care, and this time he still cares about whether the real player can finish it. It is quite serious for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and he is obviously not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, various desires were magnified to the extreme environment, and Klein suspected that other people who had been affected could not pay attention to the specific situation of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "distorted" ability of "The Baron of Corruption" was quietly and uninterrupted, but Klein suddenly saw that the men around Cynthia had no change in their movements and did not receive any Repel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clearly distorted... Cynthia after the mutation can directly resist this influence... Klein’s pupils shrank and jumped two steps to the side . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was standing in a position, a tan branch was drilled out, and the top left a flower that left mucus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowers are huge, and between them, it seems to be able to swallow a whole person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Kline has never seen the piranha in the original rainforest of the South China, he thinks it will not be more terrible and exaggerated than this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Snapped! Snapped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls, floors, and ceilings have been drilled with one and the same branches, and they are chasing Klein from all directions with wet flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, the flowers bite the head of the blonde secretary Rueran, biting the carnival Guards and the maids on the carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, with the lessons of the previous "distorting" ability to resist, Klein did not hesitate to take out his right hand, palm gripping the dark gold Advanced spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Ninth Law!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t want to use this spell so quickly, it’s not reluctant, but he hopes to fight for a while, to confirm what the Cynthia mutant is good at, then do Targeted weakening, after all, the "ninth law" can not be broadly restricted, the content must be specific enough, for example, it can not make this place extraordinary, but can specify one of the extraordinary capabilities does not work, to make it Maximizing value, careful observation and keen judgment are preconditions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the current situation makes Klein have to open the card directly, otherwise he suspects that he can not hurt the tree-like monster! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the "ninth law" spell does not create an environment that can kill monsters, I immediately use it to escape the villa, lead Cynthia to the outside, and then find Opportunity to pray, use the "Poseidon Scepter" as a saturated cover attack on the fog! Thoughts flashed, and Klein, who kept jumping between branches and flowers, read a Guhames word:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the resurgence of the opening spell, Klein's dark golden spells became cold and people lost their emotional cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Klein reached an extremely calm state, and while throwing out the "ninth law" spell, his thoughts flashed quickly, considering the restriction. what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His first reaction was to ban any desire, but clearly knew that it was too broad, so I thought about changing to the desire to prohibit reproduction. After all, Cynthia’s intention was to think There is a child with Admiral Amyrius, and her influence on the surroundings is mainly based on this aspect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the "ninth law" spell flew into the air and turned into a little dark light, and when it spread around, Klein suddenly thought of a problem:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cynthia was an ordinary person before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sure fact! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These three nights, Klein repeatedly confirmed many times with "Lingshi" and divination, I believe that Cynthia is not extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, if she is, Admiral Amyrius, who can directly distinguish between ordinary people and extraordinary people, has already discovered it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, why does she suddenly mutate into a monster is a problem that must be paid attention to! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it like Mego Oss, through some rituals, has become the carrier of the evil spirits? No, if there is a ritual, I can't find it. The spiritual instinct will warn me not to open "Lingshi", not to look directly at Cynthia... It is something and character in her body that allows the external forces to project, so Nothing happened in the last two nights, suddenly changed tonight... Anyway, her horror comes from the outside world, not itself... Klein quickly judges in this two seconds, no longer hesitate, seize the opportunity, low open Road: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "! here prohibits interaction with the outside world" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; full of mysterious meaning of the ancient Hermetic The words are swaying in an instant, and the scattered dark gold rays are intertwined with the myriad of symbolic symbols and magical signs, and they are integrated into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a whisper in Klein’s ear, and it seemed that the invisible light that was full of desire was excluded from the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, an illusory and awkward starry sky emerged from his eyes, revealing a brightly shining star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Snapped! Klein burst into two eyes, and the liquid mixed with blood and blood ran out of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he used the "ninth law" spell to isolate the influence of the foreign, but the strength of the person is extremely high, only a normal point of reflex, just wear Through the natural protection of the high-level spell, it blows up his eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This injury is rapid and there is no sign, Klein has no chance to use paper people to replace himself, just like the original "Master of Secrets" Rosago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no "ninth law" spell, he will explode more than the eyes, maybe it will become a monster like Cynthia! At the same time, the tall, tree-like Cynthia was still there, and the body collapsed into a pool of flesh and blood with brown-green tumors. The members of the General Guard and the male waiters plopped and fell, stunned by the bed and on the ground. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Cynthia head embedded in the flesh in that group, murmured to himself: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; " General, I want you to have a child ...... <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "General, I want you to have a child ...... <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She strives to stretch the ceiling, the remaining branches on the wall, and will be entangled in Klein, who is in a dizzy state, dragging I am myself. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Klein recovered slightly, and immediately tried to struggle, but whether it is trying to snap your fingers to ignite the flame, or switch the "creep of hunger", both arms were in prison because his hands Tightly tied, it is difficult to succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
