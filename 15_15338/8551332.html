Klein was in a tight heart and almost replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Dunn and Old Neil often emphasize the danger of loss of control and the probability of occurrence in front of him, this is still the first time he has encountered something similar. Some fears, some stunned, some scared, some sad, and very complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One-fourth of the events handled each year are out of control of the extraordinary... and a large part of this quarter is ours Teammates..." Dunn’s words flashed in his mind, making his reaction seem to be slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an old Neil who has experienced too many similar incidents and immediately asks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are the losers? What do we need to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein heard a sigh, he thought that the old Neil was so slick and lazy. The retirees will find an excuse to reject Swine’s request, or extort a large amount of benefits before trying to help. I did not expect that the other party did not hesitate, and directly entered the state of participation, and did not care about the night and the punitive. The difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the serious old Neil, Klein suddenly understood one thing, that is, no matter the night, the punisher, or the member of the mechanical heart The goal is to prevent the extraordinary power from harming the innocent, to maintain the peace and stability of the city of Tingen, and if there is a dangerous and urgent situation, the duty is indispensable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Swie replied briefly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be my assistant! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't explain why he was out of control, and where the runaways were, he hurried to the exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former "Calculator" captain is obviously an old man who is addicted to alcoholism, but Klein finds that he can't keep up with the other's footsteps and must trotting Get up, you can barely keep off the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the old Neil sideways and saw that the "sister" who showed signs of aging also started running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three did not care about the guards along the way, an old naval officer’s uniform, a dark classical robes, a black knee-length Windbreaker, rushed out of the billiard room and rushed out of the dragon bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The customers who drank the oil and poured their oils instinctively removed their eyes from the dogs that caught the mice, and looked at Klein and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the owner of Swein?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is he so anxious to do?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone owe debts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whispered discussion, some alcoholicists put their attention back into the cage, cheering again, venting the daytime depression, and some are more alert, vaguely uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, Old Neil followed Swein across the road and ran into the real dock area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On that ship." Swein slowed down and pointed to a riverboat cargo ship that was not far away. "Two punitive players Being on the top with the out of control, stopping him from entering the Tsock River, you helped me to influence him, control him, and then I will deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Old Neil pulled a few breaths like a bellows:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, but, you need to give me a minute, call, a minute Resume the state."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swyne nodded, no more to say, rushed to the cargo ship and joined the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to the screaming fight above, Old Neal looked at the slightly nervous Klein and pulled out a baby palm from the pocket in his waist. The silver piece was handed over:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah!" Klein reached out and caught it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front and back of this spell are engraved with the spells written in the Hermes language, as well as the symbol, the corresponding number of the spirit and the magic mark, he does not need to open the vision, By relying on inspiration, you can perceive the hidden, quiet, deep mysterious power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil straightens up and takes the same silver spell from the pocket and holds it in the palm of his hand, while walking towards the cargo ship, he makes a joke:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be nervous, relax, think about other things, for example, the spell is that I borrowed you, if you use it, remember to make one and give it back to me, of course You can wait until next month and wait until the material quota is restored before you do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...is an experienced old Neil...g Ryan put the spell into the left pocket, reached out and took out the left wheel in the gun pocket, adjusting the firing position and trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that I am not nervous..." He steadily boarded a gun, a cane, and the old Neil through the ramp. cargo ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cargo ship has obvious traces of the times. Although it is powered by steam and has a chimney, it still retains the configuration of masts and sails. And there are only metal shells on the surface, steel is used in some places, and many places are still made of wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰The fighting sound became more and more fierce. Klein and Old Neil were waiting to find the entrance into the cabin, and suddenly heard the jingle of the jingle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of the cabin made of wood bursts instantly, the thorns fly, and a figure falls out and hits the ship's side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein couldn’t look at the injury of the figure, his eyes were completely focused on the monsters that were flying to the crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster is more than one meter tall, wearing a tattered shirt and trousers that are worn out, and the exposed areas are covered with dark green scales, gaps between hands and feet. They all have a film, like the ripples between the toes of some aquatic animals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a wrinkled head that can see humans faintly, and there is mucus on the scales, which are continually dripping down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zizizi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark green mucus slightly erodes the deck, leaving a clear trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! The monster trying to break out of the crack was punched by the side of Swein and played two steps.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! The muscles of the muscles exaggerated are obviously not as good as the monsters, and the fists and feet clearly hit the other side, but they can't break the scales. It is difficult to cause substantial damage. It is very embarrassing and crumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not that he’s struggling with balance, if there’s another punishing person to follow and move, Klein suspects that the blue-eyed old man will be alive by the monster. Killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬! Hey! Hey! Swein keeps retreating and moving forward, just like the moths who know that it is a flame but flutters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Klein felt that he was accumulating something and waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swein was beaten back a few steps and also blocked the sight of another punitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster seized the opportunity and immediately rushed to the rip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wants to escape the cabin and jump into the Tsock River! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the head full of wrinkles and floating mucus, Klein raised his right hand and pulled the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver hunter bullet hit the monster's torso as he expected, but only shattered the scales and embedded them in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nose was plunged into a thick fishy smell, and Klein slammed into a short body and rolled to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! He felt the hull swaying and debris hit him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he heard an old, low voice, a mantra written in ancient Hermes:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein rolled another two times, refusing to pick up his cane, hurriedly raised his gun and looked up, only to see the old Neil calmly threw out the spell in his hand, not far from the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver sheet was quickly shrouded in a dark red flame, giving a slight explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep, quiet power instantly dissipated, and the monster that almost smashed the ship's side shook and the movement became sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Swein ran out of the cabin, bullied the monster, twisted his arm, and fired several punches like a machine gun. He hit the other's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he can only make a crack and can’t cause fatal damage, but Klein can feel that the blue-eyed old man’s savings are about to reach its peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! The monster seems to have come back, squatting on the arm, and Swift has stepped back five steps, each step on the deck to break the crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the monster is about to return, jumping off the cargo ship, Klein quickly pulled out the "small spell" from his pocket with his left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he skillfully read a word in ancient Hermes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, Klein only felt that the silver spell in the palm became cold, like a piece of snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't think much, pouring his own spirituality into the spell, pulling his shoulders, shaking his arm, and throwing it away at the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the fish-like monster has jumped into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark red flame illuminates the surrounding darkness, and the slight explosion sounds like a prelude to hypnosis, which sways quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster fell straight on the dock, fell into a group, and briefly entered a state of semi-sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was waiting to grab the side of the ship, shooting at the head of the monster, and suddenly saw the squad where the naval officer’s uniform had been lost. Follow the jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He adjusted his posture in midair, and the muscles of his body bulged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Kline’s inspiration, something that was depressing to the extreme broke out, and Swein fell from the sky, squatting on the monster, then straightening his back and heavily He punched and hit the other's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the monster is torn apart, dark red blood and gray brain tissue are scattered all over the floor, accompanied by dark green mucus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is one of the abilities of the 'Furious People'?" Kline stood on the side of the broken ship and said silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil licked his left hand and leaned over, and looked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Swein stood up straight, stood there, staring deeply at the monster that had lost his life under his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know where to take out a metal jug that went down, pulled the lid off, sipped a small half, then tilted the bottle and pointed at the monster, The rest of the spirits spilled on the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
