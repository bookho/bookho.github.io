			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now Klein, simple ritual magic has been as skilled as eating and drinking, and it took no long before he finished the preparation of the material and lit it. The candle that symbolizes you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the dimly lit flame on the desk, Klein came up with a funny idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a wax for yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going, what am I thinking about!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He converges on his thoughts, picks up the black rot flower that belongs to the field of death, sprinkles the candle, and changes For a while, it is similar to the taste of last life's formalin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he dropped the night's genus "full moon oil". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sound of Zizz, the surroundings suddenly became quiet, and the invisible, subtle feeling was surging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a step back and whispered in ancient Hermes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "我!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he changed to Hermes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I take me The call of the name;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spirit that is in the falsehood, the upper bound creature driven by, is the messenger of Dai Li Simone." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind whipped out the sound of crying, and the dimly lit candlelight instantly dyed the blue color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its light, the wall behind the desk is swaying with almost transparent ripples, a strange face with no eyebrows, no eyes, no nose, no mouth. come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has large lips and spits a long, bright red tongue with irregular teeth that are inlaid one after another. In addition, the top of the tongue is still long. Five thin fingers, which stretched out and kept pinching, seemed to be waiting for delivery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Dai Li’s “messenger”? Compared with Mr. Azick, it is like a child... No, this does not accurately describe the gap between the two sides. Well, one is an adult giant, one is a human baby... I don’t know that magic. The reason for the item is still a very strong relationship with Mr. Azko himself... I have to adjust my knowledge of it, maybe he is a high sequence strong...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Oh, I forgot, I should ask Ms. Dai Li in the letter and ask her the sequence 4 and sequence 3 names of the "sleepless" route. Mr. Azke is probably the most likely to belong to this sequence. Of course, he It may not be promoted by potions, um, perhaps by the ancestral chromosomes... I will ask again next time, the messenger is waiting...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein seriously Gazing at a few eyes, put the already folded paper into the messenger's "hand" and watch it firmly grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swipe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger took back his tongue and swallowed the letter, and the transparent, weird, creepy face followed and shrank into the wall and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have to say that the magic means is also very cool, very convenient, it is impossible to popularize... Klein looked at the normal candlelight, shaken Under the head, the ceremony was ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday morning, Beckland, Queens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hidden corner of the municipal garden donated by the Duke of Nigan, the messy and rough hair of the blonde. Dilcha and the temperamental lazy Welsh. Silly looking at the contacts in front of him, I did not know what language to use for greetings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after 1 meter 5, the short and delicate ones stared at the golden-haired big dog who swayed his tail and swallowed his tongue, and took care of his trainee knight clothes.道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, my goddess, why should I ask a dog so seriously..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls clipped a slender cigarette with his fingers and snorted道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe it is a magical creature?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never seen it like this The magical creature of the dog..." Hugh responded quite seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi sat down, closed his mouth, and pointed his finger at his abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long, thick golden hair is tied with a leather bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh and look around, make sure no one is paying attention, busy stepping closer, bending over and untiring the little bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fols looked guriously, his expression suddenly became weird:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crocodile skin And there is the style of the fashion designer Mr. Saides... She used this bag to make a deal..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...that is, Very expensive?" Hughed down the leather bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls clenched his lips and nodded seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh’s action slowed down to exaggeration, and she carefully pulled the zipper out and took out the stationery inside, as if holding an antique vase in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading, she handed the letter to Fols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls seriously watched it, lit the stationery with cigarettes, and saw it turned into black ash and fell into the mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no additional information available." Hugh unconsciously pouted his mouth and took a stack of folded paper from the pocket of the trainer's suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Su Shi with awe and majesty, and subconsciously sweared:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is In the investigation report of recent days, you must hand it directly to Miss Audrey Hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi trembled, busy sitting, tail shaking Going fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay happy and nod, put the folded stack of paper into the leather bag, and then tie the bag back to Susie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su snorted and ran away from the smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hall's luxury villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey is sitting on the sofa in her living room, holding a letter cutter, trying to open the letter in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was her second-ranked brother sent back from the Southland Bailang Empire, and there was a parcel arrived with the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, she saw Su Shi push the open door and rushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi Duan was sitting on the carpet in front of Audrey and patted the leather bag with his paw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are such a good messenger!" Audrey did not blame her praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi looked back at the door, swayed the air, whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your friend Very serious. When I saw her, I remembered it. At that time, there will be a special hunter to train us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is when Earl Earl buys a hound Gifts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi, your Lun language is more and more fluent...that is, there is still a problem with the logic of the language... Audrey looks at the Golden Retriever himself Untied the leather bag and rip open the zipper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...there is no result, but the phenomenon of the disappearance of the tramp was discovered in the Beckland Bridge area. Oh, this is not certain. Maybe the tramp suddenly changed the original trajectory..." Audrey turned over the investigation. Report, seriously think about how to respond to Hugh and Fols: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell Hugh, as long as she can find the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qi Linguesi's whereabouts, I Just buy the "Sheriff's Official" potion formula for her... No, this is not friendly enough, it will make her feel inferior, um, I have to say so, Hugh, I have prepared your bounty, as long as you can Complete the commission, 450 pounds of cash is yours... Hey, the main material of the "Reader" only found the spinal fluid of the Farsman rabbit, and the pituitary gland of the adult colorful lizard... Glorin , Hugh and Fols have not found it for the time being...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey, happy, at least you have thoroughly digested the "audience" potion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the materials, you can become the extraordinary of Sequence 8! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey converges on thoughts, picks up paper and pen, and writes quickly Replying, re-plugged into the leather bag, and entrusted Suxi to run again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of the Golden Retriever dog disappeared at the door. She opened the letter from her brother and began to read with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear sister:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think you should also come to the Southland to come to the colonial area of ​​the Bailang Empire. Abundant sunshine, refreshing air, clean environment, freshly caught seafood, all kinds of unique customs, docile obedience is very suitable for the servant's Bailang aborigines, as well as the taste of freedom. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beckland is cold, humid, the air is very poor, often foggy, often can't see the sun, and the population is much more, more There are all kinds of problems, um, there are never-ending dances, banquets, and salons... Those social situations are stiff and stiff, so I don’t want to stop for a moment, dear sister, I think you have the same feelings. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to escape from the family, I am just pursuing my own life, but our brother certainly will not think so, he has always been a selfish person, of course He is not jealous of you, because the wealth you can get is only a little, and I am the biggest enemy of his inheritance. After all, our father is a long-sighted count, and will never be bound by the eldest son. . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as he feels it is necessary, he can do anything, just as he disregarded strong opposition and sold half of the fields and pastures into the banking industry. . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will still miss Beckland occasionally, but mainly miss my father, miss my mother, miss you, miss those years, you make me feel different A good smile, you must have become the most dazzling gem of Beckland, but unfortunately, I may have to come back in two years, the career is a man's self-respect, and the outstanding young people of the Kingdom of Lun take the world as the stage. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can tell our dear aunt, the coastal zone of the Bayan Empire is very Suitable for vacation, it is very suitable for her joints that are sore and swollen every winter. I sincerely invite her to be a guest. If you can also be with her, it would be even better. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't send you too many gifts, mainly some have Rich Bayer style things, such as the characteristic yellow silk, such as jewelry full of death worship color. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember that you have always liked the mystery of things, I will help you pay attention, the folklore here has too much mystery. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the letter, Audrey picked up the pad and paper and pencil. After leaning against the back of the sofa, I slammed my mouth and wrote: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My dearest Alfred:"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it’s been less than a year, the little girl you remember has grown up and no longer likes occult, you don’t need to collect similar things. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
