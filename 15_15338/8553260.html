			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the room, Klein carefully placed the cane and the lantern on the same hand, vacating the left palm, so that when there was an emergency, the first Take time to pick up the items in the same side pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are spells, there are Azick copper whistle, some tarot cards, in addition to the additional Rosago legacy features "All Black Eyes", set All his coping skills are met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and the bodyguards just took a step, the brilliance of the lantern illuminates the badge on the side door, which is made up of the wheat symbol, the flower symbol and A simple baby surrounded by spring symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Emblem of the Mother Earth..." Klein said solemnly and lowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the former value of the night, distinguishing the symbols of other churches is one of the basic skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguard lady is slightly invisible and nods, seems to be affirmative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black gothic court dress in her body is more gloomy and horrible in this environment and atmosphere, and the pale face is illuminated by the fire of the lantern. It’s like a resentment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are other adventurers coming here, seeing this scene, you will be scared to run away and stumble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein held his breath, extended his left palm, pushed the stone door hard, and raised the lantern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that the pattern here is very consistent with the previous one, like the perfect blend of small prayer rooms and giant statues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the open space covered with wheat-colored slate, Klein illuminated the three-story steps in front of the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a four-and-a-meter-high white stone carving on the steps. It is a beautiful and feminine lady with wheat ears on the soles of the feet, surrounded by springs and dresses. Flowing out, a variety of herbal flowers, and depicting the image of different animals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady’s chest is high and her hands are holding a cute baby hidden in her, which is holistic and dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't it the statue of Mother Earth?" Klein whispered in a slightly whispering mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguard did not answer, nor did he deny it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Checked in a circle, the two left the room and opened the third door next to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This door is followed by a ramp that can be used by four people in parallel. The front is dark and deep, mysterious and strange, and I don’t know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will first confirm what is behind the four doors on the right," Klein suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t dare to rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguard lady drifted away and gave a reply with action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two opened the four stone doors on the right side, respectively, and saw the "storm emblem" composed of the wind and the waves, and the "Sun St." "The emblem", the "God of War" badge combined with the dusk symbol and the sword-shaped logo, and the "Knowledge and Wisdom Emblem" represented by an open book and an omniscient eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Correspondingly, there are four suspected statues of gods in the room:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been wearing black Armor, foot waves, windstorms, lightning-backed, majestic middle-aged man holding a trident;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a pure white robes cover, holding the contract in one hand The book, a young man with a golden ball in his hand, he is handsome and energetic;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a warrior with a sorghum, a sword in front of him, he After hiding his face in the visor, the whole body armor has an indescribable sense of ruin;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the book and the eyes of omniscient, wearing a hood, only exposed Old man with mouth, wrinkles and long white beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the god of steam and machinery, the six orthodox gods have prayer rooms in this strange hall, and there are statues! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the weak position of the Church of Steam and Machinery before Russell, this issue seems to have some explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's really wicked..." Klein couldn't help but half want to test the bodyguard's reaction and sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a collection of six orthodox gods in a magnificent hall that is 100 meters deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is unthinkable in the current era! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the six true churches make their Lord and other gods in the same building! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the custom of the ancient Quaternary? Also, what happened to the humanoid statue, although it looks normal, not as sinister as the "original witch" or "real creator", but it still makes people feel weird... What happened? Let the image of the six gods evolve into the current abstract symbol... No, perhaps it is, but the master here, the big aristocrat who is suspected of being a member of the family, deliberately shaped the human form of the six gods for a certain purpose. Statue... Hey, I thought of an item in the last generation of novels, six souls... While waiting for the bodyguard to answer, Klein spread his thoughts infinitely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Bodyguard did not respond in this regard, whispering plainly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes... Klein was a little scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his view, the centrally placed door often has a special meaning, perhaps the most central area of ​​this ancient building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this probably means the most dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What instinct do you have there?" Klein hesitated for two seconds and asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the use of fog to eliminate interference, he feels that the inspiration and spiritual intuition of the bodyguard is more reliable than his current level of divination. After all, the state of the other party is very special. Close to the spirit, you can communicate with the spiritual world without barriers and get inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young bodyguard closed his eyes and replied after a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was dangerous. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this danger is constrained."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After deepening, don't rush any Items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger of being bound... Is this equivalent to what is sealed inside? Klein made a guess and went to the central stone door with the bodyguard and set foot on the dark black floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flare of the lantern seems to be a little weak, and it is very difficult to drive away the darkness ahead. Klein has left his left hand into his pocket and holds the Aziz copper whistle and A few spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about thirty steps, the bodyguard suddenly paused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein raised his right hand lantern and found that the front was blocked by boulder and mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a stone door on the left and right sides that is the same shape as the hall. The right side is half open and the inside is filled with mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe this ancient building was on the ground, but I didn’t know why it sank into the ground and collapsed." Klein groaned, "We can There is only one left in the direction of choice..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not fall, and saw the young bodyguard floated to the front, stuck to the boulder, melted in and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein’s mouth twitched and began to wait patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, the bodyguard was drilled out of the dirt on the right side, and the body was not contaminated with dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has completely collapsed." Her expression gave a flat conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was speechless for a moment, only to smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the two looked at the stone door on the left side that was not completely closed and had a gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein approached the past and carefully looked through the gap of about 3 cm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a discovery that was previously blocked by the stone gate:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strong, dazzling spiritual brilliance, two groups close to the dark gold color, two groups of deep blue as the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the vision, Klein’s normal vision followed a scene of “narrow”:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The fire that penetrated the room reflected the black slate, which had a pile of white bones covered with decaying clothing, some of which had dark gold and dark blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary characteristics of cohesion? Magical items? When the thoughts flashed, Klein swept to the end of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large open door on the dark wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody door! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be fresh blood on the door, which is reflected in the fire and is steadily falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein originally intended to let the bodyguards explore the road, and suddenly felt the change of the Azick copper whistle held in the palm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original cold and soft touch is biting, deep and dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... Klein blinked and instinctively stepped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he found his right arm was numb and itchy and began to swell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mind, the picture flashed, and Klein immediately took out a tarot card with his left hand and brushed a wound on the right arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not blood in the wound, but a tiny black bug that creeps! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black worms fell on the ground and eroded a little smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They struggled and embraced, but they eventually melted into the flames of the lantern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, the black bug at Kline’s wounds finally flowed out and began to overflow with red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squirmed muscles, controlled the small wounds, and did not let the blood out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguard lady looked at the scene quietly, and the good-looking brow wrinkled remarkably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just wanted to talk, but found that the cold and deadness of the Azick copper whistle did not weaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, his gaze swept the shadow of the bodyguard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was originally without a shadow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Run!" Klein shouted and ran away from the lobby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguards quickly floated up, and the two saw the lanterns in front of them being gradually engulfed by a black shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein ran wildly and ran like a hurricane in the increasingly dim light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shadow is getting bigger and bigger, getting closer and closer, more and more intense, the fire is about to be completely swallowed up, and at this time, the gate is still several meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, according to instinct, Klein slammed forward and swooped, and then rolled over and crossed the Shimen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire is suddenly bright, the uneasiness of his heart disappears instantly, and the Azick copper whistle of the palm also restores the soft and cold touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young bodyguard floated beside him, looking back and concentrating on the deep and dark martyrdom, with a rather uncertain taste in his tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
