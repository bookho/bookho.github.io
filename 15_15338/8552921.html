			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey is not surprised by the "sun" requirement: since Silver City popularizes the "playing method", then the time is calculated and the other party is close to At the end of the digestion, seeking a follow-up potion recipe is certainly one of the highest priority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not know how to play the "singer"? Sing a song every day? Meet the battle, hide to the side, use the voice to bring courage and strength to the companion? Or bless yourself, then carry a hammer and a sword, and go forward? I don't know if this will bring about the improvement of singing ability. If you can, it is definitely a good singer or opera actor... Audrey is thinking with interest, deliberately not eager to express his own difficulties. In order to avoid the "sun" temporarily increase the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not part of her tutoring, nor is it something that was learned during an extraordinary gathering. It’s purely after she was promoted to the “reader”. skill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will find the sequence of the "Greek" route for you as soon as possible, but not today, can you accept?" Audrey considers Said, then looked at the old long table at the top of the first glance, "We can ask Mr. 'fool' to witness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Klein smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Missing 'Justice', maybe I can pay for the 'Prayer' formula for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Audrey suddenly brightened his eyes, and the small and fast nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem! What should I exchange with you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t think about it for a while... Klein chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This doesn’t have to worry, Maybe my best people will have something to help afterwards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem he considered was very simple, if the "Justice" lady was in her few extraordinary Get the "Prayer" magic in the circle The formula of medicine, then the knowledge he sneaked from the "eternal sun" at the cost of being burnt, is not wasted? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least in the "Tarot Club" will not be useful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I will do my best to help them!" Audrey promised happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein put his hand on the front and there was a yellow-brown parchment with the formula of "Prayer" potion containing alternative materials. And ancient names, and all translated into giant language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main material, a piece of gemstone or a powder of blazing soul; mirrored blood or melting The heart of the pulp monster; auxiliary materials, a golden flower of Phnom Penh, three drops of aconite juice..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his light push, the parchment Appeared in front of the "sun." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although knowing that even if it is completely forgotten, it can be recalled by Mr. Fool, and Dairik still seriously recites the formula, for a while: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Missing 'Justice', we can communicate with the dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'fool 'Mr., I am asking for a separate exchange.' Audrey quickly raised her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What she originally thought was that "the sun" would put the corresponding content on paper and read it for herself, but it was not convenient for her to ask questions and still have to write Down, re-push to each other, communication will become very complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single communication? Really alone communication, you probably don't understand what the "sun" is saying, and the "sun" is the same... Kline's tone is nowhere to be said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ok."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the extraordinary circle, the Hermes language is a must-have knowledge, and the ancient Hermes language is a content that can be learned and is more popular. Giant language, dragon language, elf language, etc. are relatively niche, and few understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, Klein blocked the "downside down", so that he could not see, and could not hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger had a certain interest in the information of the dragon, but did not want to pay the price to attend, so he kept silent and waited quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See "Mr. Fool" made a gesture to start communication, "Sun" Dairik silenced for a few seconds, organized the language: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dragon family is The deadly enemies of the giant Wang Ting, they all look like magnified lizards, covered with scales of different colors, strong and powerful limbs, wide wings enough to drive their giant body to fly fast, is the ruler of the sky."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have flames, some can drive lightning, some can cause corrosion, and some can make frost, but this is not the mainstream of the dragon family. The largest number of dragons is the dragon of the soul represented by the king of the dragon, Angel Weide. The extraordinary way of the dragon of the soul is the 'audience'. In the city of silver, we generally call it the giant. Dragon 'way.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For similar transactions, Dairik was the first to prepare a copy of the history textbook of the general education course, but found that "Justice", "hanging down "Mr." and himself do not seem to be behind a "world", he gradually To know the value of the common history of those silver city, so he just put the dragon, do not speak giants, elves, heterogeneous, Phoenix, vampires and other related information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The King of the Dragon" Angel Weide... This is consistent with the record in the church books... Audrey gently decapitated, politely did not fight Break the "sun" to tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick recalls the textbook:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the time, the dragons were the most powerful and most Terrible is the 'King of the Dragon', Angel Wade, which is also known as the 'dream dragon'. In addition, its son, Al Sukhod is also shrouded in the sky, overlooking the earth and the ocean. The famous strongman, its title is 'Dragon of the Nightmare.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About the "dream dragon" Angel Weide, there is such a legend, The things that it imagines will surely come out, and the country it imagines will surely come to the material world, and its declared future will be staged and become a reality."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...Klein suddenly frowned. If it wasn’t for "justice" Audrey was listening to the words of "the sun", he could definitely find his anomaly, even though it was thick. Gray fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The description just made him think of the seal "0-08"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future of the claim is bound to be staged...the characteristics are somewhat consistent! Klein leaned back on the back of the chair, seemingly more relaxed, and actually more focused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon of fantasy, very cool... This is the performance of the gods! Audrey listened to her eyes and was excited and looking forward to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick paused for a few seconds and continued: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s son, 'nightmare The Dragon's Al Sukhod is equally terrible. It can dominate the minds of every creature and let them act according to their own will. These creatures are hard to detect, think that is their true thoughts, and they will weave in reality. The real nightmare, let a lot of souls unconsciously join, and then give the cruelest and most horrifying ending."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legend is particularly fond of pranks, it will make the prince Going to kiss the princess, but the waking princess has rotted most of the time. It will let ordinary girls wear dance shoes and dance in front of the prince, but they can’t stop until they die. It will make all sorts of coincidences. Let the fate of many souls turn to tragedy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of coincidences...It sounds more like the seal "0-08"... Of course, I don't know much about the seal... Kleinke has restrained the chin. Impulsive, make yourself look like an old well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a terrible dragon...but its ability is very interesting." Audrey was half sighed and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the future of the "audience" approach? No, I have to call it the "Dragon" route! I don't want to go to another sequence! Audrey can't wait to become the "psychologist" of Sequence 7 and continue to advance quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik replied sincerely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Distance from the dragon family and the giant The history of the royal family has passed two or three thousand years. All I know comes from textbooks. It comes from legends and does not guarantee truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least your history has not Dangdai." Audrey was in a good mood and comforted, "What later?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
