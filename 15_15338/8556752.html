			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a moment, Klein thought he was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the blur caused by the light is not serious. He is familiar with the other party and quickly confirms the previous judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the time to breathe once, Leonard disappears, the light spreads out, the valley restores the quietness of the winter season, and the picture seen in Klein’s dream follows broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his eyes and placed the badge from Llanus on the surface of the bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really Leonard, or Leonard of the ‘no faceless man’ disguise?” Klein thought about it and threw a gold coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spirituality tells him through this medium, that is the teammate of the Tingen City Night Club, Leonard Mitchell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the 'investigator' sent by the goddess church for that party, or the avenger who is looking for the opportunity to risk the night hunter?" Klein wondered. It is difficult to make an accurate judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no pre-information at all, his divination cannot give inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds after silence, Klein laughed at himself and drew a red moon on his chest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wish him good luck, may the goddess protect him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein no longer struggles with this issue, prepares to know more about the details of the party before deciding whether to ask for it in the future. Participate, do you want to anonymously remind Leonard Mitchell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, a secret room in the underground area of ​​the Steam Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons took off his hat and pressed the fluffy but not soft hair and sat down to the first position on the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he took out the ancient silver mirror of Arodes from the special pocket on the inside of the garment and placed it in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His right side, his opposite, his slanting direction, there is a "Mechanical Heart" deacon and captain, they are all members of the pre-God meeting, The Archbishop of Beckland, Hora Mick Haydn, summoned the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This archbishop wearing a white priest's robe is now an ordinary old man, sitting at the top of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the arrival of the staff, he looked around and said softly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From ICON Start, talk about the investigations in these days in order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons. Bernard pulled his hair and flipped thick documents. The language is succinctly reported: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archbishop, we are responsible for the Sherlock Moriati part, after detailed investigation and assistance with extraordinary means We confirmed that he was involved in this matter passively. Prior to this, there was no evidence that he knew the problem of Prince Edessac.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He And the dead Tallim Dumont is a friend, indirectly completed some of the commissions given by the prince, but that is no problem, at most it is a false report of some expenses. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Icons suddenly has some guilty conscience, because Sherlock Moriati is also the "machine of heart" informant, he is here Expenses for reimbursement are likely to be exaggerated to some extent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what, his informant work is fruitful and very good enough to offset many problems. And, he became our informant and soon, the one that involved the most money was still "divided into"... Icons slowly vomited and continued to report:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Our conclusion is that he belongs to the innocent, there is no hidden plot behind him. He has been keenly aware of the dangers of the Red Rose Manor, but it is a typical example of the correct reasoning error. He is afraid of the royal family. To this end, he has been passively absenteeism and has not conducted a substantive and in-depth investigation. This is what he reported to us. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately, he still couldn't avoid this incident, but he was lucky enough. The descendant of the god he mentioned was monitored near the Red Rose Manor, and he was rescued from the ruin of the Rock. The traces on the scene indicate that this is a very terrible attack, with a high probability of being associated with '0-08'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein mentioned Ins in the letter. Zange Weir and the existence of "0-08", as to whether he knew the former archbishop and the "0" seal, no one cares, because he was with Azike Aegis at the time, it is entirely possible It is learned from the other party's mouth, which is also the judgment of all people subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the "0" and "1" seals, the seven orthodox churches have been informing each other of the rough situation, number sharing, and there is no duplication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... However, we did not grasp all the circumstances, and there are three things that cannot be confirmed. First, '2-111' shows, Sherlock. Mo After Riatti escaped into the woods, he was not eager to stay away, but stayed in the same place, wondering who he was praying to, second, when he and Azke Aegis knew the problem, and third, how did he get from the underground? The problem of the escape of the relics, with his strength, should not be done, and in the process, he even destroyed the advent ceremony of the Aurora." Icons finally concluded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2-111" refers to the mirror of Arrods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horamik listened quietly and laughed at himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" False report fee..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately cleared his throat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter what, summer Locke Moriarty is the hero of Beckland.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is no timely stop, if he is afraid at that moment, choose to escape, we Most of them are not living now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, he also showed faith in God, being kind to us, as long as he didn't have much problems, some small flaws and small secrets, We can all do it without knowing it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord Bishop, this is what we think." Iconsson sighed. "I guess he is The prayers in the woods, including the rituals of blowing copper whistle, are all ways to contact Azke Ai Gesi, but the effect is different, the speed is not the same, in the critical situation, the only thing he can do is self-help, this is the point. We are inferred from the process of follow-up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to self-help, you can also write a suicide note." Another "Mechanical Heart" deacon ridiculed In a sentence, I immediately reported on the part of my responsibility. "...we still can't find the underground ruins described by Sherlock Moriatti, even with the help of '2-111', and the royal high sequence is strong on the day. Whereabouts, we are temporarily unable to master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "... can confirm that the night church received the earliest information, which is derived from a special channel of Earl Hall, the details are unknown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... The Aurora will be combined with the night and the punishers in the power of Beckland to clear most of them, but I suspect that they still have hidden power..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"... When the incident occurred, Sherlock Moryldi mentioned that Teres was heading to Bakerland, but after that, no one had seen her, according to Sherlock Moria Tidy’s statement, she is a key figure and was renamed Trischik.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“...can’t figure out how the night church was captured’ Desperate Witch's and Housekeeper Finkel, the result of divination tells me that they are still alive, but they are not free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deacon and team leader reported their findings, and Holamik was half-closed and seemed to be thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quiet time in the room, he opened his eyes and said in a slow speech:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for Trichicchi, if she is still alive.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Collect the questions that cannot be effectively enlightened by divination and hand it over to me, church There are saints who are good at this, although not necessarily more effective than '2-111'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Monitoring and investigating the royal high-ranking strong can be placed on the 'brand table', don't worry too much, they always know that we are doing these things This is also a warning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
