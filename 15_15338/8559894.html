			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind with ice scum and goose snow slaps and slaps to Klein’s face, letting him look at the surrounding environment while being involuntarily The ground was tense and shivered slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really...cold..." He almost sweared out and made sure he was in a snowy sky with extreme visibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally thought that the wet and cold winter in Beckland was the most terrible, but now he finally understands that the absolute low temperature and the knife-like wind are the combination of death. Even if he had added a sweater beforehand, the jacket was a thick long dress, and it was a bit uncomfortable at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he did not wear the "sun brooch" because it produced a hot layer of spirit and was used to fight the effects of strong cold in a short time. Not letting the body become stiff, it is effective, and it can be faced with the long-standing ice and snow environment, which is tantamount to suicide. The heat of the spiritual level will make the body release the pores, in the summer state, and withdraw the last of the low temperature. A layer of defense, even voluntarily greeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Klein dropped this magical item on the fog and prepared it for a specific occasion before he took it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh environment made him dare not delay, after initially observing the situation, immediately burned the blood on the copper knife and stuffed it into the pocket, then Klein took out the "Adventurist Harmonica" and tried to blow it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whistling wind, quietly opened the vision, he failed to see the messenger Miss Renee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, here and the spiritual world are not connected, or, here, there may be a unique spiritual world of their own... well, so, to the "Poseidon" "Prayer has no effect. Only the mantra pointing to the mysterious space above the fog can penetrate the barrier...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is coming, as the god of knowledge and wisdom. Believers, Edwina holds the name of this true God, why didn't she try to ask for help? Or, if you tried it, it didn't work? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well...not every god will personally respond to believers, and in many cases it seems to give corresponding feedback according to certain rules, like this in person. The "hidden existence" of the order, can not find the second ... Klein laughed and made a preliminary judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately put the harmonica, took out the paper with the fresh blood of Daniz, wrapped it on the top of the cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Daniz's position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein whispered and used it The scepter search method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, according to the results, he stepped on the thick snow, under the faint sky, quickly walked through the raging wind, and then divination again and again. Adjust the direction, after all, Daniz will not wait in place, it will become ice sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about ten minutes, Klein found a red glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... He vomited and walked a few steps to see the goal clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was indeed Daniz, the well-known big pirate dressed very thin, holding his arms and moving forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he doesn’t seem to be very cold, because he is surrounded by a red-colored fire crow, evaporating snow, blocking the wind, bringing Warm as spring feels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein is particularly envious of the "arsonist", although the "magician" can also summon the flame, but this is an attack that cannot be maintained. Ability can only be used in an instant. To rely on it for heating, it must be summoned and will soon be exhausted. As for the ability to "manipulate the flame", it depends on the existing flame or the material that can be ignited. They are extremely scarce in the world of ice and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the one that only soared the flame crow, Klein stepped up and moved closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz noticed someone coming over and was shocked. After seeing through the snow and seeing who was coming, he suddenly sighed and then smiled. Weirdly piled up a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, there are no stars here, and getting lost is inevitable."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't pay attention to his words, and asked directly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sold?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "burned!" Daniz nodded quickly, and the whole person revealed a fear that was difficult to describe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stared at Daniz for a few seconds, confirming that he did not lie, and immediately pulled out the Griman Sparrow-style courtesy smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "I have been mourning his name, that is, His believers." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Daniz’s expression was distorted, and then he squeezed a few more ugly smiles than he cried.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to change my letter! I don't want to believe in unknown unknowns! He is screaming in his heart, but he doesn't say anything in his mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suspects that if he wants to refute, he will be buried in the snow by the madman Spallo Sparrow!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Ryan smirked with a smile that was a bit crazy, and the tone added: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, confidentiality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Once you divulge, you and your captain will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does the captain have? Relationship?” Daniz asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein keeps the expression just now, smiling at Daniz Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz has opened his mouth and already knows the reason, only to laugh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I am like someone who can't keep a secret?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded and took out a note with Anderson blood With a low laugh, to Daniz Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Faith in Him, serve Him, maybe one day you will become a leader like me.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At that time, your reputation will be spread to the five seas, no worse than the pirate generals. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the conversation, he wanted to match the gesture of a "fool" believer, but sadly found that there was no such thing, so he had to comfort himself in his heart. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret organization has to be secret, and there is no point in making these superficial matters... "The man hanging up" is right...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No worse than the pirate general...Daniz suddenly shines.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I have already missed the hidden existence From the occultist corner, it is really difficult to get rid of it. It is better to take this opportunity... He thought a lot, and even got a name for his child.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘿, if it weren’t for the Gelman Sparo people to set it up here, I would say directly that by then, you will have the reputation and strength to match the “Iceberger Lieutenant”. It’s another thing to dislike it. According to my observation, your big chance is hopeless. Edwina’s partner should be able to talk to her. Learning and progressing together, discussing the kind of knowledge together... Klein took a few words and once again used the "Busman Search Method":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Anderson Hood's position. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...has he also come in? "Daniz was a sneak peek, and then asked a little stunnedly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein read the sentence, let go of the cane, confirm the direction of the fall, point Nodded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is not at ease outside. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that you are also watching the guy of Anderson Hood...Daniz is hard to smile and smile:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! He is the kind of person who smiles on the surface and turns to take a knife! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has a bad reputation in the foggy sea. All the pirates don't like him!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He just deliberately smashed you, wants us to guard you, hostile to you! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the pirates like him, they can only show that the title of the strongest hunter has water... Anderson’s provocation, I heard... Klein didn’t respond again, 捡Get a cane and walk in the blizzard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniez is close behind, using the flying fire crow to disperse the snow, blocking the cold, let the two It’s not frozen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s good, very conscious... At this moment, Klein once again felt the benefits of having a servant – there was an umbrella in the rainy day, a blizzard Some people are heating!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of white pelicans, the two seem to be black spots, squatting on the snow, walking a little bit, using nearly twenty Minutes, I arrived at the position pointed by the rod.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No..." Daniz looked around and could not find the trace of Anderson Hood. Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no doubts about Galman Sparo’s “The Method of Searching for a Man” because he is the last person to be found.<b r /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein frowned, opened the mind and strengthened his inspiration.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, he has It was noticed that the cane was only poked forward, and the snow on the ground collapsed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a cave in the collapsed place, the rock inside was dark and reflected The fire.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein squatted, peering inside, and found that the hole extended a narrow road, and at the end of the road, a pile of red stones The strange underground plants are burning slowly. Anderson Hood sits next to him, and leisurely roasts a creature suspected of being a rabbit. The smell of oil spreads with a warm feeling and penetrates the nose of Klein and Daniz. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you coming? Do you want to give it a try? There are strange rabbits that can survive in the snow. Anderson buried his body and looked at the entrance to the hole, like a companion who greeted the wilderness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he did not say anything provocative, but this moment I really want to beat him... Klein jumped into the hole without expression, and came to the fire and felt the long-lost beauty.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz Followed, looked at the flames of the roasting rabbit, looked at the fire crows around him, and silently removed them all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, you How to find this hole? Daniz refused to admit defeat, but the body was very honest and approached the fire.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson turned the rabbit in the dark dagger He took a look at Daniz:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunter first lesson, observe the environment, get acquainted with the environment, and use the environment. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz's expression suddenly stiffened on his face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson looked at the grid again Mann Sparo, sneer: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going out of the hole, how is it, not bad? The intensity is very well controlled. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, he sniffed the smell in the air:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Baked, do you want to give it a try? Although I didn't bring the seasoning, there is rock salt here, which is a bit of a smash. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure you can eat?" If this is an extraordinary creature, you may go out of control on the spot. "Daniz啧啧 said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson gave him another look:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunter II Lessons, distinguishing between what can be eaten in the wild and what can't. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully explored his hand, pulled his leg down, stuffed it in the mouth, and ate it with gusto.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Klein was about to speak, and suddenly felt that there was a mad and violent atmosphere outside from far and near, the pressure from the high creatures was just the essence, let Daniz's body tremble uncontrollably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
