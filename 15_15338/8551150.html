			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tingen City, 2 Narcissus Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who left the note, locked the door and walked to the roadside waiting for Leonard Mitchell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard’s short black hair is a bit longer than last month, and it’s very messy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, with his good looks, emerald-like eyes and poetry temperament, there is still a different kind of beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, any hairstyle is to look at the face... Klein subconsciously vomited, pointing to the direction of the Iron Cross Street:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frye is waiting for us there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Leonard took care of it. The shirt, like a casual question, "Do you have any clues from the information?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein left with a stick and walked along the edge of the street :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no matter the way of death or the time of death, I can’t find a rule, you know, a ritual involving evil spirits, demons, Must match a specific point in time or a special way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard touches the special revolver hidden under the shirt and hidden under the shirt, light Laughter: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not absolute. In my experience, some evil spirits or demons are very easy to satisfy, as long as he produces the next thing. concentrated Interest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And certainly a significant portion of these deaths are normal and must be removed in order to get the right answer."<br />< Bryan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gave him a glance:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So the captain asked us to re-explore and rule out normal events." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leonard, your tone and description tells me that you have enough experience in similar areas, but you have become a night-timer for less than four years, average There are no more than two extraordinary cases encountered each month, and most of them are simple and easy to solve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always feels Leonard Mitchell, a teammate who is weird and mysterious, has not only been skeptical about himself, but also thinks that he is special, and he is sometimes sacred, sometimes arrogant, sometimes frivolous, sometimes deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he have an adventure? There are also adventures that make him feel that he is the protagonist of the drama? Klein combines a wealth of films, novels, and TV dramas "Knowledge" to make a rough guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard his question, Leonard smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is because of you It has not officially entered the state of the night owl, and is still in the training phase."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Church will organize the extraordinary cases encountered in various churches in each parish into books every six months. And according to the different levels of confidentiality, make certain cuts in different versions, and then send them to each member."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are in the course of mystery In addition, you can apply to the captain and enter the Chanis Gate to borrow books from the previous cases."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has a sneak peek:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The captain has never reminded me of this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not had the opportunity to enter the search until now Nice door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard chuckles out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you were used to the captain's Style, I didn’t expect you to expect him to remind you innocently.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he meaningfully added: “If any day, the captain remembers everything. Nothing has been forgotten, then we need to be vigilant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this the captain's unique style? I thought it was a question attached to the 'sleepless' sequence..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day and night caused memory loss...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Accurately the unique style of 'nightmare', reality and dreams are intertwined, often people can't tell which ones are true, need to remember, which are fake You don't have to put it in your head..." Leonard wanted to say something more, but the two had stepped into Iron Cross Street and saw the "collector" Fry waiting for the public carriage site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frye wearing a black round felt hat, wearing a thin trench coat of the same color, carrying a suitcase in his hand, pale skin makes people suspect that he will suddenly stand The disease is falling, and the cold and chilly temperament keeps the surrounding drivers waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After each other, the three did not speak, silently merged, and crossed the "Slim Bakery" and turned to the Iron Cross Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;喧嚣 扑 扑 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 卖 街 街 街 街 街 街 街 街 街 街 街 街 街 街 街 街 街Slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, at five o'clock, many people returned to the Iron Cross Street, and the sides of the road began to be crowded. Some children mixed up and looked at it indifferently. Look at all the pockets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein often comes here to buy cheap cooked food, and used to live in a nearby apartment. The state of the place is quite familiar, so I reminded me:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful with thieves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard smiled and said: "Don't care."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled the shirt, adjusted the gun bag, and let the left wheel of the waist be exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, watching his eyes move away, the pedestrians around him did not consciously give way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein groaned, quickly followed Leonard and Frye, and lowered his head to prevent people who knew him from noticing himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Banson and Melissa are still in contact with some of their former neighbors, after all, they have not moved far enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the numerous street vendors, the three of them entered the real street of Iron Cross Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passers-by here are dressed in old and tattered clothing, full of vigilance against the appearance of strange and glamorous, and revealing greed, as if staring at the rotten vulture, Attacks may be launched at any time, but Leonard's revolver effectively stopped all accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We started the investigation from the death last night, starting with Mrs. Lauves who pasted the matchbox." Leonard turned the information and pointed Not far away, "No. 134, 1st floor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the three people moving forward, a ragged playful child quickly hid to the side of the road Look at them with stunned, curious, scared eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at their arms and their legs, just like matchsticks." Leonard exclaimed, first to enter the 134 with three layers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of mixed gas suddenly got into Klein's nostrils, he could faintly distinguish the smell of urine, the smell of sweat, the musty smell of moisture And the smell of coal wood burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; couldn’t help but raise his hand to cover his nose, and Klein saw Beechmont Barton, who was waiting here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheriff in charge of the surrounding neighborhoods has a brown-yellow hustle and bustle, and is full of flattering feelings for Leonard, who is inspected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, I have let Lavis wait in the room." Beachy Mountbatton smiled with a slightly pointed and unique voice. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He apparently did not recognize the many spirits and decent Klein, only to please the three chiefs, led them into the 1st floor of Lavis Family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On both sides of the door, there are stoves, toilets and a small amount of coal, wood, etc. There are two dirty grounds in the center. A man is wrapped in a quilt that smashes out of the hole and sleeps, making people almost incompetent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower bunk of the bed, a woman lying there, the skin is cold and gloomy, obviously has lost all life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the corpse, sitting in a thirties-year-old man with greasy and messy hair, he looked languid and his eyes lost his gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lavis, the three police officers came to check the body and asked you something." Beachy Mombaton shouted, not paying attention to the ground. There are still people sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wilted man looked up weakly and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This morning was not checked, Have you asked?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was wearing a gray-blue worker's uniform with traces of sewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let you answer and answer, how can there be so many questions!" Beachy Mombaton reprimanded the other, then toward Leonard, gram Ryan and Frye laughed. "Sir, that is Lavis, the bed is his wife, the deceased. After our initial inspection, I died of a sudden illness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and others stepped on the toes and walked from the gap between the floor tiles to the bedside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High nose and thin lips, temperamental cold Fry did not speak, only gently patted Lauvis, indicating that he let go, easy to check the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the sleeping man and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, my tenant." Lauvis scratched his head and said, "This room has 3 Suzler 10 pence a week, I am just A dock worker, my wife made a matchbox to get two and a quarter pennies, 1 ,, yes, 130 boxes or more, we, we have children, I can only rent spare space to Others, a floor shop only needs 1 Sule per week..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a tenant who helps the set in the theater, and will not rest before 10 pm, just I sold the right to use the ground floor to this person, this gentleman, who is the guard at the gate of the theater at night, um, he only pays 6 pence, every week..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the introduction of the other party, Klein could not help but look at the corner of the basket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1箩130 boxes or more, only earn 2.25 pence, the price of almost two pounds of black bread... How many times can you paste in one day? (Note 1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard looked around in a circle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before your wife died Is there anything unusual for a while?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauss, who had already answered similar questions, pointed to the left chest: "From last week, um, maybe it was Since last week, she often said that it is very stuffy and breathless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the precursors of heart disease? Normal deaths? Klein interrogated: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you see the process of her death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawless recalled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the sun goes down, she will no longer work, candles and kerosene are much more expensive than matchboxes... she said she is very Tired, let me talk to two children, she will take a break first, and when I look at her again, she has already stopped breathing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the sorrow and pain of Lawless can no longer be concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and Leonard asked a few questions, but failed to find unnatural factors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at each other, Leonard spoke:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
