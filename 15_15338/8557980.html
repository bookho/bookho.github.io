			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, how is she looking at Mr. "The Fool"... "Justice" Audrey is keenly aware of the "hidden" movement, which makes her Quite confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her opinion, this is an unusual reaction. The "slowing man" is clearly a thing that has nothing to do with everyone. It is about The so-called "Poseidon" Cavitowa seems to be depraved but still occasionally responds to the doubts of believers. Why does the "invisible" lady want to look to Mr. "fool"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cavituva is falling...Occasionally responding to believers... "The hidden person" is watching Mr. "The Fool"... Is it... Audrey’s eye Bright, unconsciously had a guess: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it now a replacement for the believer in Kavitova is the 'fool'?<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. 'Hidden' knows something, so? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about the electric turn, "Justice" Audrey also followed the body half-turned, looking forward to watching the leisurely sitting on the top of the bronze long table Mr. "The Fool" in the chair.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, "Down Man" Alger is also surprised by the movement of the "hidden" not in the expected range. Shocked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was only trying to test her relationship with Laceia, a member of the Morse Abstinum. How could she suddenly look to Mr. Fool? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does she know that the current 'Poseidon' is the embodiment of Mr. 'Footer'?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "She responded to this largely! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She had had many secret contacts with Mr. Fool before being pulled into the Tarot, and even secretly worked for him?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Algey more and more, pay more attention to the "hidden", and then subconsciously follow each other, looking at the "fool" in the gray mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, "hidden" and "justice" are divided into successive orders, but the almost unanimous action makes the "magician" Foers and others apparently aware that it is wrong. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How are they watching Mr. Fool? Is the death of "Poseidon" Cavitewa related to "Folly"? Fols and Emlin White thought that they were smart enough to speculate on the cause and turned their attention to the top of the bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik does not know who is "Poseidon" Cavitowa, and it is not clear what it means to respond to the believer after the death of the other person, but since Everyone is watching Mr. "The Fool", and he naturally followed the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "world" is a second late, as if to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first swept the "downside down" and saw that Algero was a little scared and then changed the direction of the line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein has already realized that the "invisible" lady is guessing from which details she may be replacing the "Poseidon" Cavitewa to respond to believers, tangled In the question of how to express. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should pretend that "this is only a small matter, I have not put it in my heart, since you mentioned it, then I will admit it by the way" or "body For the gods, there is no need to explain everything to you. There is no need to explain anything to you. There is no need to admit or deny it..." Klein recalled the setting of "fool" and quickly made a decision:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is neither acknowledging nor denying, so as to avoid the person of the gods, but to put a sentence in a key place, so that people who have not guessed become more confused and let the skeptics In spite of the hustle and bustle, I still feel the fog, and I feel that the intention of Mr. Fool is difficult to measure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein, who leaned back, chuckled and said carelessly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Cavi Tuva is relying on the relics of the 'natural disaster' Gao Shinam to become a demigod."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They originally asked Mr. "fool", Ask about things related to "Poseidon"... However, this still can't convince me, I always feel that there is a deeper truth hidden inside... Is it... No? "Magic" Firth frowned and started a variety of associations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That half-god-level scepter is the character of Cavitowan, or the relic of the 'natural disaster' Gao Shinam, or both definitions? 'The Scourge' is who Heinham is, the name is very elf style , the amount, 'inverted man' mentioned that Laticia discovered the remains of an ancient elf... the residence of a superior elf?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mr. How did you get the scepter? By ‘hanging people’, or who else? No, it’s not like ‘hanging people’, otherwise he won’t take the initiative to mention this... Mr. ‘fool’ instead of ‘sea god’ responds to what the believers are plotting? Is this a part of his recovery that really affects the reality? "<来 /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "hidden" Jia De Li Ya thinks more and more, more and more people feel that the level of "fool" is so unpredictable, just like He is now Like the shadows covered by thick fog, the more you can see clearly, the more confused you are, the more horrified you are, the more you are afraid.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be between gods Game... Jia Delia sighed in my heart and felt it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My guess is not wrong! "The hanging man" Alger finally confirmed today The "Poseidon" is the incarnation of the "fool". His worries and embarrassment seem to have paid off at this moment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are occasions, disguised as ' I can pray in a bright and calm manner to the goddess of the sea god... I don’t know how much the 'fool' has recovered, how much power can be revealed from the seal? Even if it only reaches the semi-god level, it can provide a very big blessing at sea...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'hidden person' is not too surprised, which shows that she does I have already had contact with Mr. Fool, and I have learned some things in advance. This reverse also indicates that her sequence will not be low. It may be a strong pirate general... This is both good and bad news for me. Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The good thing is that there is more power in the sea and more support from the strong. At some point, we can cooperate tacitly and complete some things that were previously unimaginable. The bad thing is that most of my intelligence and resource channels will be covered by her, and the role in the Tarot will go down. Of course, all this has a premise, that is, she really is the 'star above' . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I have to adjust the focus of collecting intelligence and resources, and more to the church, this is where she can't replace me." Alger was happy and thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Poseidon" is really "Folly" Mr.! No, no, no, it should be said that the current "Poseidon" is the incarnation of Mr. "Folly"! Has He begun to really interfere in the real world? This is great! If I travel to the sea in the future, I can pray directly to "Poseidon" and get a response? "Justice" Audrey was surprised, happy and proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as she knows, in the major churches, there is no fixed ritual magic, and it is a multi-year priest who can only receive prayers by prayer. Occasionally encountered, or a god who can be indexed by hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the case where every prayer has a response, it is also an extreme exception in the "God". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I can! Mr. "The Fool" is returning to his throne step by step. Replacing "Poseidon" is one of the steps... Audrey did not hide his emotional changes, smiled and sat tall and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshinam? This is the name of the elf. I seem to have heard of it... "The Moon" Emlins thought to make memories, but it was not harvested for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the death of Cavi Tuva, "Poseidon" is still responding to believers and "hidden", "justice", "downside down" to "fool" "What is the connection between Mr., he vaguely guessed a little, but did not think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this have to do with me? It will not affect my ability to save the blood, nor is it something interesting! Anyway, having a question to pray to Mr. Fool is right! Emlin sighed a few words and expressed disdain for other people's emotional changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heavenly Disaster"? "The Queen of Natural Disasters"? There is no record that her name is Gao Shinam... "The Sun" Dairik has a small side to the left side of the head, which is his usual movement when he thinks about things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the small "sun" is not clear whether Gao Shinam is the "Queen of Natural Disasters", otherwise it will not be such a reaction... Klein Disappointingly retracted the corner of his eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
