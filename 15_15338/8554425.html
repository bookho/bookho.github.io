			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggestions? My suggestion is how far to hide, to stabilize the main... When I heard the "sun" problem, Klein gave the answer in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in order to maintain the image of the "fool" and see what other people would suggest differently, he kept silent and did not manipulate the "world". Opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short silence, Alger looked sideways at the "sun" and said quietly:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The information you provided is too small, and it is difficult for us to give useful comments."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't know the half In addition to the 'real creator', that is, the strange statue of the 'fallen creator', there is nothing in the ruined temple, and naturally there is no way to analyze the corresponding situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; "The fallen creator" is indeed the "real creator" ah ... "The Sun" life of the Silver City actually has the "real creator" belief, but also built a temple ... "Magic" Firth is listening If you are interested, you can take a book and write down the book. "Justice" Audrey looks forward to the "Sun" specific description of the strange temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick nodded and his eyes looked slightly for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idol, there are still many broken murals, horrible evil spirits, but this has been removed by the two elders of the six-member council, and the team has been removed..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The murals I have not seen with my own eyes, it is said that the end of the day and the prophecy of the "fallen creator" to save believers, and the corresponding bloody sacrifice ceremony..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the corner of a mural, there are strange words that have evolved from the giant language. After a general crack, several elders think they mean:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Redemption Rose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This may be the code name of the original mural creator, or the name of the organization that built the temple and the city. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" According to the Chief Judgment, these murals have a history of at least a thousand years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "I mean a thousand years of your cognition, but I am not sure. In Silver City, we, we use the stage of lightning and frequent times for the day, when it is less and soothing. At night, one cycle is one day, and the four seasons only exist in books, so we can't grasp the specific number of days, only the chief can confirm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Having said that, Fols simply doubts that he is listening to the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A city without a sun, no red moon, no day and night, no city with four seasons is not true! Only fairy tales can only be described in this novel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the author must have taken marijuana, in a state of mental convulsions, in order to create such a city... Fols surprised after the first The idea is that I want to write a novel based on Silver City! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she quickly gave up on this plan because she didn’t know what it meant by Silver City, and she didn’t know if it belonged to the secrets of the seven churches. When the book was just published, the author himself was punishable by the night-time custodians who took the door to collect the copper pennies deposited in the gas meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Baiyincheng environment is like this, um, and the darkness of the monster that the "sun" always mentions... Unfortunately, I still only have sequences 8, otherwise I really want to ask Mr. "fool" to send me to go there to do an adventure, no, no, Audrey, you are not a naive girl, you should clearly understand how dangerous it is..." Justice" Audrey releases her thoughts from time to time and sometimes reviews herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least a thousand years? The aurora will appear no more than three hundred years, or even less than two hundred years. This should not be built by them... Well, perhaps the belief of the "real creator" was in the early fifth century, even in the Quaternary, but At that time, the organization that served Him was not an aurora... After a thousand or two years, under the pressure of the Seven Great Churches, the believers of the "real Creator" repeatedly fell into crisis, and the sects were destroyed again and again, and eventually revived for the Aurora. Klein, who had guessed, made no change in his sitting position and state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ruins of the city-state and the horrible monsters in the half-destroyed temple have been cleaned up. Our mission is to explore the underground part of the temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Do you have any suggestions? What should I pay attention to in your understanding of the Fallen Creator?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My suggestion?" Alger said almost without hesitation. "My advice is definitely not to go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'The Fallen Creator' is the real evil spirit, even though his temple It has already been destroyed, and it is likely to hide the danger of being very unpredictable. If you are leading the other six elders of the deliberation group, you must go or not, but the risk is high, but you just Say, the person responsible for this is the 'Shepherd' Lova, and the 'real creator' is the god at the top of this extraordinary way! So, definitely can't go," Alger added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your suggestion is the same as mine, but such a proposal does not require the "sun" to describe the half-destroyed temple, from the very beginning The conditions can be concluded... I understand, you are deliberate, "I hang the man", so that you have not paid for anything, you can roughly figure out the situation of the half-destroyed temple... It’s just bullying a child... The “fool” Klein, who sits at the top, leisurely reaches for the forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Sun" was silent for a few seconds, and it was difficult to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, the task is a must Accepted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""""""""" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before this mission, will you still participate in patrols? Find an opportunity to deliberately let the monsters hurt yourself. You can refer to silver on specific scales. The past examples of the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, "justice" Audrey read a message from the "sun" eyes and movements:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does this work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief surprise and confusion, Dairik frowned slightly: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, I haven’t patrolled recently..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“倒吊人”阿杰呵One voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can pretend to pick yourself up Out of control, no, the accurate statement is that getting yourself out of control is out of control. In this case, I think the top of the Silver City will definitely not bring a 'dangerous item' that will break out at any time to explore?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a skill. If you keep your spirituality in a more dry state for two consecutive days, you can produce auditory hallucinations, signs of loss of control, and then not If you continue to squeeze, the situation will improve within a week, and you will not really lose control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, you must have methods and measures to save the uncontrollable precursors. Recovery should be faster, so you have to estimate the time, preferably two or three days before departure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik heard one For a long time, I muttered to myself: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, people who have runaway precursors will be controlled and will be isolated in the round tower. Underground, receiving treatment for drugs, ceremonies, and magical items. If the situation is mild, use only medications..."<b r /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, a honest and sincere good boy is poisoned by an old fritter...but, "Down man", why do you know to let yourself? Close to out of control skills? If this technique is used frequently, the loss of control may actually come... Klein sighs in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Justice" Audrey was also stunned and felt that she had a good lesson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the "Sun" is still hesitant, and does not seem to want to deceive the elders of the Silver City, "downside down" Alger asked slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other elders of the Sixth Committee know that the 'fallen creator' holds the 'Shepherd' route?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
