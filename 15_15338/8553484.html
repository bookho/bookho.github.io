			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Vilas is located in the western part of the Kingdom of Rouen, across the Hornaces from the Republic of Intis, but in Beckland, A street named after it, located on the edge of Queens, is the headquarters of the Capital Police Department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people choose this street to settle down, for peace of mind, Raft Pound is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the street house with the number 29, the baron is dressed in cotton pyjamas and stands in a warm living room, standing in a closed window Next, staring at the opposite side of the West Vilas field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was just in his early forties, he had already had two white spots, his eyes were swollen, his wrinkles were obvious, and his body seemed to be sipping alcohol anytime and anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floor behind Raft was littering some torn female underwear, and the opposite of this was a fireplace burning with flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine glass from the baron's hand raised the remaining liquid in one breath, then slowly walked toward the door and wanted to go back to sleep in the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no pipe for transferring heat to the fireplace, he feels the chill of the bone marrow in the late autumn as soon as he leaves the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Raft Pound whispered a curse and staggered to the door of the bedroom, twisting the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dim light inside the bedroom, only a faint blush glows into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruffett is about to close the door, fit down to the bed, and his eyes suddenly solidify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chair next to the curtain is sitting quietly in a figure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure is wearing gray-blue clothes and trousers, wearing a dark-colored cap, and the whole person is hidden in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected Pound’s gaze from the baron, the figure slowly raised his head and looked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face is painted with red, yellow and white, like the most funny clown! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruffett is about to call out, turn around and escape, but sees a revolver aimed at himself and hears two words that are low and dull:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suggest you not to do unwise things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you cooperate well, I won't Injury, you won't take away your belongings if you have one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruffett Pound’s face changed a few times, very honestly Close the door of the bedroom, then raise your hands halfway and sit by the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, what do you want me to do?" He slammed the wine cellar and reminded him with a slight trepidation. "The opposite is West Vilas! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, but I think, I am closer to you than Westvilas." Kline, who made a clown camouflage, changed his voice. And the tone, warned, "And my purpose is just to ask you some questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Before coming to West Vilas Street, he was in the fog It is dangerous to take a divination in the mysterious space and get a very safe answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Question?" Raft’s lips twitched for a while, bitterly laughing. “It’s coming again... can I never escape this nightmare?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A lot of people have asked?" Klein followed his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, not just asked! My uncle, after the respected old viscount passed away, there were too many things happening around me, and the old man The housekeeper resigned without reason. I didn’t know where I went. The attendants and the maids changed one after another without any warning. They became strange and cold. They were looking for something, right, looking for something. I was less than 10 years old. I can only look at it like that, I dare not tell others, I am afraid that I will never wake up again!" Raft replied quite in a crash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you looking for? Looking for the underground building, or the treasure of the Pound family, for example, the extraordinary features and magical objects buried near the evil spirit? The royal family and the church should not be unaware of it. The top must know the extraordinary character and the law of conservation! Since the Pound family is broken, should similar things be taken back? Unless, the old Viscount paid a great price, and purchased the extraordinary features and magical items of the same sequence, so as to conceal the underground building things... Klein calmly listened and produced a lot of speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be relaxed, but he can always ask at any time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long has this day been maintained?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I don't know, there are faces that I don't know. How do I confirm that the rest of the people are not accomplices? Oh, I pretended not to find anything, trembled for several years, then at Under their induction, drinking alcohol, playing with women, gambling, smoking marijuana, doing all sorts of things that make you feel like a waste!” Raft Pound slightly smiled nervously. “They finally feel relieved, no longer staring at me. Wait until I sell the house, they call, leave, don't know where to go, no, they are still secretly monitoring me, not letting me call, right, don't let me call you!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy has a mental illness...I don’t know if he’s saying it’s true or not, the mood color changes very logically, but in case he just feels guilty For the old viscount, I fantasized about such a drama, looking for my own fall. The reason, after that, I have completely persuaded and completely believed... As a qualified keyboard powerhouse, Klein, who knows a little bit, has seen similar cases in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for two seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did these people ask you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They asked me how the two children of the old viscount died, and asked the old prince what was wrong in the past few years. I was less than 10 years old. I don’t know anything at all!” Raft waved his arm and couldn’t hold his voice and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calm, please calm down." Klein pressed his left hand and turned to ask about other things, trying to confirm Pound from multiple angles whether the Baron knew that Underground building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a question and answer, time flies past, and Klein whispers: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You don't seem to know anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I am bothering you, I should say goodbye."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up, slightly stunned, and gave a gift, which was very educated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, the impact of the collapse and excitement of Raft Pound’s face disappeared instantly, and the light blue eyes became very deep, as examined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the intruder dressed up by the clown is about to stand up again, he immediately resumed his performance, anger, madness, bitterness, and nervousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, his voice suddenly sounded a mysterious voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blush!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein perfuse spirituality into the "Sleep Charm" The left hand of the gun threw it at Rafter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the burning sound, the strong and strong tranquility spread, shrouded the man from the baron, so that his eyes could not stop, let him The body fell softly on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, the inquiry was just for comparison with the future. Then there are programs such as 'Dream' and 'Psychic'." Klein patted The other person’s pajamas, with their hands pressed against the chest, once again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he used the "dream charm" to enter the other's dream like a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray, fragments, the world that is constantly flashing, Klein walks awake and rationally next to Rufft, watching him meet a blank face, no There are five senses, the waiters and maids who feel the horror, watching him always look back and look at his old face silently, watching him curl up in the corner, shivering and watching him shadow A little bit shrouded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very consistent with his previous description... Klein tried to guide to figure out the truth of the matter, but Pound seems to have something from the baron. Very serious psychological shadows, a little irritating, will yell and scream in the darkness of the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Klein unable to get more information at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, he quits the dream and adds a "small spell" to Raft Pound, and then takes out "Amanda" pure dew and other materials. Prepare for a psychic ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
