			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold sea water instantly drowned Klein, soaking the golden red dress on his body, making it heavy like a stone, dragging the human body down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, "squirming hunger" also ate the pirate, reducing the weight of a whole person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not try to rise, but continued to sink, faintly heard several rumors passed through the waves, like the pirates of the "sailor" approach Persevere to catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is their home! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can be active here like fish for a long time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not panic, as a "magician" who did not perform unprepared performances, he certainly considered the evacuation plan after the failure of action, after all, nothing Will be 100% successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in order to best play Elaine, not to be found by the "disease lieutenant" Trey, he not only did not bring the rest of the magical items and wallet cash, Even the spells related to the water and wind fields have been thrown on the fog, but this will not hinder his play. The state of the trinity of the gods, the deaf and the believers has many wonderful operations to deal with similar situations. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly made the "squirming hunger" pale and stained with green, and the surrounding seawater frozen and turned into a layer of hoarfrost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the hoarfrost completely condensed into ice crystals, Klein's back butterfly muscles moved, arms slammed open to the sides, with the help of the "live corpse" Those frosts are broken and they are allowed to fly into the sea further afield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, there is a small space around him that does not exist in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water flows in an instant, and to fill this gap, Klein stretches out his left palm and releases a terrible chill again, spreading over and creating a sea of ​​water. Ice wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a short time, he seems to be in the sea in the ice, can stand, can speak, but can only be confined to a relatively small space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately went four steps counterclockwise, and read the name of Fusheng Immortal Tianzun, and quickly let the spirits enter the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His figure just appeared on the high chair of the "Foolish", and he immediately picked up the "Poseidon Scepter" placed in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without recognition, Klein thought about the light that symbolized the new "Poseidon" believer Gelman Sparo, following the establishment in advance. Good contact, lift up the milky white scepter, let the blue-green "gems" bloom and shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He responded to "believers" and put himself a layer of spell-like effects, including but not limited to underwater breathing, free action, and resistance to stress. In the end, he used paper angels to interfere with divination and issued orders to underwater creatures in the surrounding waters to help and cover the escape of German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, Klein did not delay, and immediately returned to the real world and regained control of his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the pressure of the sea has squeezed through the melting ice wall and re-enacted the "independent" space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Klein has been able to breathe smoothly and swim fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a sea fish swim over the rippling and crystal water, and saw a shadow rising from the sole of his foot. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a weird brown-red octopus that is so large that it seems to be able to hug and wrap the entire boat with tentacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It spits out the ink around it, darkens the nearby waters, and several "sailors" who are searching and chasing the attackers are invisible. The body is actually paralyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they re-dive and search for enemies again, they have completely lost the trace of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Klein is swimming freely on the bottom of the sea, and even has a free distraction to relive the action just now, reviewing the gains and losses:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "playing Elaine is fully prepared, letting her sleep with her bed, I don’t know how many nights, Trey has not been able to see through the first time, and promoted the digestion of potions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The process also overcomes psychological barriers and finds a mental state that is both integrated and extracted, which greatly helps the digestion of potions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The basics of fighting are basically the best, belonging to a prepared performance, but still underestimating the power of a sequence of 5 'painful witches', underestimating a step Stepping into the experience of this level of 'disease will', even if she lost the magical items at the beginning, it is difficult to kill with my current strength and seal, unless the 'Poseidon Scepter' is used...but This is in the waters of the Rothschild Islands.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today's battle can be very clearly seen, I still lack a powerful offensive magical item..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the failure of action, Klein is undoubtedly somewhat lost, but he is not depressed, because things are not over, he intends to write to Azick Sir, see if the other party is interested in the ancient literature related to death, and have time to come over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has a snap finger to light the coat before leaving the captain's room The men’s clothing that was replaced in the room, as well as the hair and dander that belong to him, this surface looks The reason is not to leave a trace, but the reality is to cover up and deceive.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to hide the invisibility of being thrown into some rooms after entering the cabin. Hair and buttons that will be noticed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When "the disease is going to be", Trey is misled into being an attacker who is afraid of revealing his identity, afraid of being cursed by the air, cautiously wiping After losing all the traces of her own residue, it is difficult for her to let the pirates seriously check whether there are still similar things.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those hair, buttons In a certain period of time, Klein can use the divination to lock the position of the black death number. In this way, as long as Mr. Azick expresses his will, he can take the other party and quickly find the "drug lieutenant" Trey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, I thought I didn’t need the help of Mr. Azick, and I could succeed on my own. After all, it was a little worse... Kline sighed. I feel that my self-esteem is somewhat hurt.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why he doesn’t open One of the reasons for looking for help from Daxie is that he can’t be completely sure that Trey has mastered the ancient literature related to death. If it doesn’t, let Mr. Azke’s white run is quite The embarrassing thing, and he is worried that even with the assistance of Mr. Azick, to find the black death number, find the "disease lieutenant" Trey, still have to become Eileen, still have to wear the other's clothes, Take action on your own bait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of acquaintances, this is too shameful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, if it is not for the purpose of obtaining information, it is simply to get rid of the 'disease will'' Thunder, things will be much simpler, wait for me to swim back to Baiam Going over the fog, with the locked position, making a storm with the 'Poseidon Scepter'...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not to say a wide range of attacks. It is inevitable to kill Trey on the spot, but this will cause the attention of 'Sea King' Yann Courtman. At that time, the whereabouts of the Black Death will be exposed under the eyes of the Storm Church... 'Sick girl'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shakes his head and laughs at the shoreline, following the guidance of the diviner's spiritual intuition.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Black Death, Trey lifted a heavy defense and wore a bloody tattered shirt. Go to the diamond-studded bracelet and bend over to pick it up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very cautious attacker, I was an assassin during that time, too Xu is not as good as her, no, he..." Trey gnawed his teeth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not only because she almost died in the other hand, but also because she felt each other Dyeing with Elaine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
