Klein modestly let go and asked Stuart to come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is actually telling the truth. This thing is really lucky. He knew that Emlin White was there before the other party took over the task. where. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart took off his coat, took off his hat, hung them on the shelf in the foyer, and snarled:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This damn weather is getting colder and colder, maybe I have to try the cotton jackets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't you call it cold? You go to the north of the county and go to the winter county for a day. You will understand what is the real low temperature, the real winter." Klein laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he asked generously: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A cup of hot coffee?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly what I expected." Stuart followed the walk to the living room on the first floor. "I went to the north of Kamiha, knowing the low temperatures and heavy snow there, that It was a wonderful holiday, but Beckland’s cold was not bad. It was like magic, piercing my clothes, infiltrating my bones, hey, the fireplace that people want to praise!” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart stood in front of a fireplace burning charcoal for twenty seconds before sitting on the couch and watching Klein busy with instant coffee Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New Year I plan to go south for a holiday, go fishing in Desi Bay, what are you planning for vacation? We have endured the year of Beckland's air It’s such a holiday, hard work and hard work.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, also go to Desi Bay..." Klein hesitated, Side of Stuart's face, a moment she looked in a trance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a matter of agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the agreement of brother Banson, sister Melissa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, I will let you see my sea fishing technology when I get there." Stuart said incessantly, "We still don't have enough money, otherwise it really I want to go to Fossac, go to Intis, or even travel to the South."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein got the coffee and handed the white glazed porcelain to the other party, himself Then take two steps back and sit opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart held the cup and took two deep, warm and warm gases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, he put the cup down and said very officially:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I will share the rewards I received this time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The Whites gave a total of £50, and you made significantly more contributions than I did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock, how about you get 30 pounds? I have to give my line people some hard work."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only 50 pounds? Is a vampire worth £50? Klein couldn't help but swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also knows that the Whites don’t want to increase the amount of rewards. They should be worried about giving too much money and scaring detectives, causing them to create unnecessary associations. This has attracted the attention of the police or some official organizations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ordinary private detectives, the 50-pound mission was tempting enough, and Klein asked people to investigate all the reds in the entire city of Tingen and the outskirts. The chimney house used only 7 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, the Whites also gave an extra £1, saying that it was your fare for the past few days." Stuart took out six questions with a little doubt. 5 pounds of denominations, and 1 pound of denominations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein reached out and took the opportunity to check the authenticity without explaining the fare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Except for Mr. Stanton, you are the best detective I have ever seen. Are you halfway through, or have you studied with a big detective?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow Which big detective has studied? This is much more, what Sherlock Holmes, what Hercules Poirot, what kind of primary school pupils, what is the name of the grandfather in the name of the swindler... Klein silently spit two sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am from Kamihain, I have done a lot of work in the early days." Then it became a detective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So your knowledge is rich enough!" Stuart stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, you are a little embarrassed to compliment... Klein smiled and did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart has a coffee break:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock, I will meet later I can't help you with a difficult case that I can't solve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My network in the detective world is also spread out... Klein replied cautiously: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the time, if I have time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After chatting a few words, Tuart pleaded with interest and Klein sent him to the foyer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you put on your coat and put on your hat, Stuart is about to pull the door out, suddenly turning back, sincerely said:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock, you are too simple.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your talent is worth a better coffee. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? Klein is a sneak peek, and it’s a bit embarrassing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughs a bit :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't tell if the coffee is good or bad, it's the same for me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sending Stuart, Klein went out I bought some beef bones and some beef at the butcher shop, went to the vegetable shop and bought ingredients such as white radish, and matched the corresponding seasonings.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants Preparing a beef bone radish soup for dinner, used to serve the rest of the rice. As for noon, he found a restaurant on the street and ate a lamb chops.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Leisurely afternoon, Klein continued to study the "Book of Secrets", the more he saw, the less he knew too little about occultism.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, his foundation is solid Many things can be quickly grasped as soon as they are touched.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, he smells the seductive scent of the ox bone soup, and the throat I twitched up and down twice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the sound of the doorbell again, which is like the horn of the rice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Swallowing, Klein went big After that, he grasped the handle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a natural appearance of the visitor in his mind, that is the handsome but not masculine red vampire Emlin White.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to urge... It’s a trustworthy guy... Kline opened the door and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good evening, Mr. White. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin raises his chin and makes the impatient look overflowing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is about to Opening, Klein glanced at the brown priest's gown on his body, revealing the "I understand" smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You just came from the harvest church?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Emlinton, he could not maintain the gentlemanly manner, biting his teeth: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The old man, the old man...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Damn, what the damn hints to eliminate?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Klein's answer, he patted the clothes on his chest and raised his face:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Take me to see the patient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a rich dinner waiting for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sucked my nose and saw what it smelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t say more, put on coats and hats:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, I am taking you there now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the door and take a few steps, he cautiously asks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Do you have a medical practitioner certificate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else to convince Mr. Jurgen to let him agree with Mrs. Doris taking the medicine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin looks at the sky at forty-five degrees:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need that Kind of documents to show my ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Klein frowned, he casually added one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It's too simple, I just got it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... This tone sounds very proud of the medical practitioner certificate. ... Klein smiled and didn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin looked at the wet ground in front of him and said casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know my most Do you like Beckland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Klein did not add a curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin laughed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long gloomy sky, covering the sun's fog This makes me feel too uncomfortable even when I go out during the day.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is great, except that the air is not very good. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the vampire will really suffer some damage from the sun? Fortunately, I thought about it yesterday, did not bring the sun brooch, otherwise it is not Law and Emlin exchanged... Klein seemed to understand something.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room, they have arrived outside the Jurgen home, Klein stepped forward The doorbell was ringing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the door opened and Mrs. Doris, who was dressed very thick at home, opened the door with surprise:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Detective, are you coming to be a guest?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Cat Brody is quietly beside him, watching Emlin with vigilance, it seems that this guy is not quite right.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein points to the vampires around him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a new doctor who is good at treating the lungs I am sick, so please ask him to help you, this, Dr. Emlin White. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? Do you still remember this thing? Really a good boy! "Doris pleasedly invited the two to enter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children... Klein’s mouth was fretting and eventually nothing was said.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to the living room, Emlin lowered his voice and said to him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
