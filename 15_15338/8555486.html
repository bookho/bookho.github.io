			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aiming at the picture that appeared in the silver mirror, Klein suddenly expressed his expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This mirror is very powerful, and it has its own name, which seems to be a living seal...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The harm of such a thing may not be too great, But the seal is very difficult, not a special case, and it is rarely used. The mechanical heart member named Icons Bernard seems to be in a low position, should be a deacon, and it is not simple... Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The limit that divination can do is almost the result of the silver mirror that was just presented. Even if I go above the fog, there will be no better. Harvest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'desire apostle' can't be determined. People who meet the conditions of high cheekbones and blue eyes don't know how much in Bakerland... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​Klein was mixed, and the image presented in the silver mirror quickly faded away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb Then, the words that are red and bloody are outlined in the mirror:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the principle of reciprocity, it is my turn to ask questions, if you lie or answer no Out, will accept the tasks I have arranged or be punished. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Klein looked at his eyebrows:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the truth Big adventure mirror? A little bit of meaning...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the word of blood drops slowly into a new letter, the new statement:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The real name of red light? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Light? One of the leaders of the Brotherhood of the Net Light? One of the seven rays of the high spirits? Klein seriously thought about it and found that he would not A.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only knows a "yellow" Wilnia.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icone throat After a brief squirm, the forehead was sweating.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief silence, he said in a deep voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Nanides! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Error. "The blood red words on the mirror have changed again. "Task, or punishment?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iconser’s expression was obviously struggling, and eventually he vomited:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" punishment. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice just fell, a silvery lightning was born out of thin air, squatting over his head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Zizz, Iconser's hair straight up, his body slammed down, and a little black smoke came out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The mirror did not follow him to the ground, but floated on his own and descended on the table.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two seconds, ICON trembled The chair stood up, then sat there, panting while shaking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at it all without saying a word, for a long time, I didn’t know what to do.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons, who was a little slower, looked at him and barely squeezed a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should I have heard of what, what is a seal, and we should know that they all have certain negative effects. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Klein looked at the hair that Icons stood up, and suddenly understood why his previous hair was so fluffy, messy, and stubborn.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein couldn’t help it. Say one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, you can ask yourself, there is no need to be in front of me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call, the requirement of this mirror is that someone must be on the sidelines. "Icons is still shaking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's really spiritual... Klein went up the table two steps and came to the table, curiously scrutinizing Looking at the silver mirror, I found that this living seal has nothing special except the pattern, and there are no special places.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons was facing him, shaking and screaming:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can also ask questions, we don't mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't have this idea." Klein would play "True Truth" with a guy like a pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the conversation, he tried to touch the edge of the silver mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The touch is cold, the feeling of metal... Kline just came up with such an idea and saw the old silver mirror tremble slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It quickly emerges with white words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your faithful and humble servant Arrow Dess is at your service."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? Klein was in awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he stayed away from the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the situation? This mirror was just very cold and I was playing "True Truth" with people... How did it turn out like this? Klein was funny and confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly made some guesses based on the information available:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver Mirror knows The real name of 'Red Light' seems to have a certain relationship with the spiritual world...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the mysterious space above the fog seems to be related to the spiritual world. At least when I summon myself, I can see the place of the suspected spirit world through the gate...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This mirror called Arodus is aware of the fog Breath?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One by one, Klein saw Icons slowed down, stood up again, and took the old silver mirror. The other two players in the room also ended up pretending that they did not see anything, and the purposeless search. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After some inspections, Klein bid farewell to Icons and others and found Essinger Stanton who returned to the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you do next?" he asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger’s expression replied solemnly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Let Stuart and their Family members moved together to facilitate protection, but this can only be a short-term solution.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I and you, as well as Caslana, normal activities, accepting secrets The protection, I hope to find out the 'desire apostle' as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you a believer in the god of steam and machinery?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Klein replied, drawing a triangular emblem on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he lamented:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time, only in the bathroom Dare to get into the fog...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens, Hall Inside the luxury villa of the Earl's house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey looked at the elegant wall clock on the wall, endured tension and excitement, and sat down in front of the dressing table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will go to the home of psychology teacher Islant, and step out as a key step in becoming a full member of the "Psychological Alchemy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, she had to calculate the time to pray to Mr. Fool and ask for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this time I can see the angel? Audrey thought with expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She calmed for a few seconds, her hands clasped, and stood in front of her mouth and whispered the name of the "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 Minsk Street, Klein is standing in the living room, watching the scene that has finally cooled down, a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, the “desire apostle” brings only danger, and in Stuart and others, there is also a change in life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to solve it as soon as possible... So many extraordinary people have so many seals, there is always something to restrain the "demon" way... Thoughts are mixed, Klein suddenly listens To the illusion of the Unreal cascading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be Miss "Justice"... He had prepared to look around and walk to the bathroom if nothing happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he locked the door of the bathroom, he couldn’t help but sigh in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "My life has also been changed a little..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the threat of "desire apostles" was lifted, accepting the "mechanical heart" secretly protected He can only go as little as possible on the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next week, "Tarot will", streamline the process and content, but how to compress, ten minutes or so, ah, constipation is normal The matter, who stipulates the extraordinary can not constipation? Klein struggled to reverse four steps and entered the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, "Justice" Audrey followed the previous teachings and held a simple ceremony to enter the "artificial sleepwalking" state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein saw her appearing in the dark red star, she followed the instructions and proceeded with the spirit, first to contain the "Black Emperor" card with the spirit. Then pick up the paper man who cuts the craft and lift it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No accident, the paper man gathered the power of the swaying above the fog, turned into a huge angel with twelve pairs of dark wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey saw that the sacred and majestic angels came to the front, wrapped their layers with wings, and could not speak for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the angel, the angel of the "fool"...and the twelve angels of the wing! This is exactly the same as the description in the mythical books... This is also the angel of our Tarot Club! Audrey looked at the figure of the angel and quickly disappeared, suddenly felt that the other party was very kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was pleased, excited, and sincerely thanked Mr. "The Fool", then called the maid and told them to prepare for going out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled back to the living room and looked at the hole in the wall that was hit by bullets: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Is it cheap to cover the cheap oil paintings, or to fix it, paint it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillston District, Seventh Avenue, Islant At home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey let the maid and bodyguards stay in the living room, and they took the golden-haired big dog Su Shi and followed the owner into the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the living room, there are two other people waiting, one is introduced by Mrs. Norma, the psychologist Hilbert Arukard who knows Audrey. One is Stephen Hampres, the convenor of the previous psychological seminar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, although it was already a dinner party, only a regular candle was placed in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candle was placed in the middle of the coffee table, slightly shaking the dim fireworks, dispelling the darkness in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for each other, the skin color is brown, and Hilbert, who has a little bit of Southland descent, looked at the golden-haired big dog Su Shi, but did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey smiled apologetically:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With it, I am safer Feeling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi also looked at Hilbert with innocent eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can understand this mentality, please sit down." Hilbert smiled and sat down on the sofa on the other side of the coffee table, Hampshire and Iraq. Slant also found their position and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Audrey sat down, Hilbert picked the candle and made the light brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks at Audrey through the candlelight:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
