			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the jungle of Blue Mountain Island, in the base of the resistance army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carat in a wheelchair lifted his bare head and looked at the sunlight that fell on the hole, and his eyes were unreservedly happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can clearly feel that since God’s return to the earth and the promulgation of the Ten Commandments, he has changed the blood and chaos of the past, and from time to time, the believers are full of wisdom and glory. The guide, and actively intervened in the situation above the sea with insight into the level of all things, trying to help the Rebels, helping all Roths, out of a difficult road that can see the dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is the true meaning of returning to the earth... Karat recalls the god that I just received, guessing that the red-haired woman named Elaine is 撬Move "Terrorist Lieutenant" Trey, shake the power on the sea to contrast, shake the key to the balance of the country, and only the world situation becomes chaotic, Rosde people can get the chance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karate took a breath, quickly arranged the ceremony, prayed to "Poseidon" and copied the photo of Elaine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he instinctively turned to look at the other side, the expression is quite complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a high priest who lives in the direction of the Poseidon Church and lives in a religious person who was originally at the top of the Rebels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not dare to disobey the gods, they did make a great change, but in many details, they are still immersed in the past, stubborn, conservative, backward, Barbaric, refusing to embrace a more civilized church... They will continue to do so, and one day they will be abandoned by God... Karat can hardly conceal his inner smile, but inexplicably a strong sense of sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read through the prayers of the believers, pick and give a response, gram Ryan returns to the real world, and he intends to go out and find people on his own initiative, and take a look at where there is a real opportunity to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he grasped the handle on his right, his mind suddenly flashed a thought that was ridiculous but achievable:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My real purpose is not to find the red-haired Elaine, but to get in touch with the 'disease lieutenant' Trey, to figure out the ending of the rich businessman Jimmy Neck, to figure out the batch of death The whereabouts of the ancient literature.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, all I need is a red-haired Elaine who can lead the 'sickness of the disease' to Trey, as for whether or not Really, it doesn't matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can completely turn myself into a red-haired Elaine, let Daniz send me to 'Gillies' Ozl, and receive a reward by the way, and I am simply and simply waiting to see 'The disease will be' Trey.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This operation is good..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slammed his head and found a reason to veto the idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it is no face, but women I am now Still can't accept it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Is it a psychological barrier to this aspect? Is it one of the codes?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And I don't know the red-haired Elaine. I don't want to pretend that it is disguised. It's only a piece of skin. It's hard to deceive someone who knows her. Then I don't see the 'sickness of the disease'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, finding Redhead Elaine may not be Trey, it may be the enemy of this pirate general.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know the details of the 'disease' will not be able to assess the level of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stable is better, follow the will of the heart, first find out the red-haired Elaine, master the details from her, and then consider what to do next." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Klein suddenly noticed that something was wrong in the living room, and Daniz’s snoring was noticeably smaller and became smaller for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Iceberger Lieutenant" is coming? Klein twisted the handle and opened the door to the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to cover up the smile of his mouth and said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The captain has just arrived.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "She said that the fleet of 'blood above' appeared on Long Island and continued to sail south, as if to enter the raging sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The source of this message is trustworthy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;长尾岛? The southernmost island of Rothschild? It seems that "the blood above the top" did intend to come to Baiam, but was shocked by the confrontation between Cavitowa and "Sea King" Yann Courtman, bypassed here and went straight to the raging sea... well, His intelligence officer, Old Quinn, did not send a radiotelegraph notice, which should be one of the reasons... Klein regretted that he could only say that the plan did not change quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- He intended to use the hunting "Blood Admiral" as a furious adventurer and bounty hunter German Spalo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Killing a "steel" Maviti is always lacking in shock... Kline has no openings and looks at Daniz calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi was seen somewhat uncomfortable and laughed at two channels:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' The blood will be 'sliding away, and your cooperation with the captain should stop?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I go back to the 'Golden Dream'? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After you can contact through your messenger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sinks down from the pocket Take out the pen and brush and write the way to summon your messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he shook his wrist and let the piece of paper fly out like a foil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz's sequence 9 is a "hunter", and it is easy to catch the sticky note with one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced twice, and the palm suddenly burst into a red flame, burning the paper completely into ashes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, even if I forgot, the captain has a way to remind me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused, smiled and asked again: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I go back to the 'Golden Dreams' number?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gently daggers :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can...can! Daniz resisted the urge to swing and celebrate, so as not to stimulate the madman Spallo Sparo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled cautiously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go to pay for the room during this time. By the way, I went out and bought a ticket. You know, Bayam is not calm recently. The captain does not want the 'Golden Dream' to be docked here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Still will be a man, knowing that the room rate has been settled... Klein did not speak, kept a cold posture, put on his coat, picked up his hat, and walked out of the luxury suite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his back disappeared in front of him and disappeared at the corner of the stairs, Daniz retracted the room, clenched his fist and waved twice:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great! Great!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Finally free! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put on the cap without delay, and settled the room at the front desk of the "Azure Wind" hotel and told that it was not a check-out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi soon came to the street and went straight to a place called "Seaweed Bar", only to feel that the outside air is so sweet, so that people feel comfortable <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps, he suddenly swept a piece of notice posted on the corner of the wall:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The notice was only two steps away from Daniz, and the familiar looks were in stark contrast to him wearing a cap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Daniel grinned, showing a sad smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was busy pushing the cap down, almost covering his gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, he was still uneasy, looking for the nearest department store, bought a gray scarf, wrapped around the neck, and put his nose with his mouth. Wrap it inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until then, Daniz was slightly relaxed, stepping up and rushing to his destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seaweed Bar" belongs to the local gangster gathering place, often with famous pirates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there is not much intelligence and resources involved in the "Swordfish Bar" and "Scented Leaf Bar", it also has its own characteristics: there are many underlying channels! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing Daniels has to do is to buy a black ticket to Gragas, there is no need to provide proof of identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very clear that his previous rewards have been filled with all official ticketing points, the original "White Onyx" first class. Tickets are also obtained in a similar way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the bar, Daniz did not remove the hat and scarf, carefully looked around and found Denier selling black tickets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not go straight, taking his eyes back from the thin, black, thirty-year-old man, looking for a living face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some selection, Daniz crowded the crowd, came to a young man drinking at the bar, patted the other's shoulder, and lowered the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me a favor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The young man was alert. I saw a sneaky guy: the lower half of his face was tightly wrapped in a gray scarf, and the cap on his head almost covered his eyes, and nothing looked like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dress is simple, it is very suspicious at first glance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is the lowest winter temperature in the Roths Islands around ten degrees Celsius! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz refers to the next Denier:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See that guy?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me buy a ticket to Gragas tomorrow. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He handed over three 1 pound notes, laughing low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It belongs to you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the black ticket is much more expensive than the regular ticket, Graggs is not far away, more than 3 pounds, of course, due to the shorter journey. There is no need to buy first class.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Daniz does not buy it himself is to worry that Denier recognizes himself and things will be a little troublesome. Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When his reward is only 3,000 pounds, pirates and adventurers of the same level or lower consider that it takes several people to join hands to solve him. Gold is not enough to make people forget the deterrence of "Iceberger Lieutenant" and bear the risk of losing their lives. They rarely attack him aggressively, so in a similar black market, his safety can be guaranteed.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, his bounty has already been 5,500 pounds, even if several people join hands, each can get a lot of money, and the sea is the most desperate!<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, many feel that their rewards are low, and they want to prove their strong, they will definitely pick Dani. This name is a low-risk target.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, Daniz fears that De Nie will turn and sell himself, simply hire a face to go Buy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
