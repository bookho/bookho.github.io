			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After half an hour of uninterrupted silence, Klein opened his eyes and slowly got up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a cane, put on his hat, left the church, and took a rental carriage back to Minsk Street in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the warnings and investigations in the surrounding area have inevitably relaxed, becoming the shadow of the gas light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after the zero crossing, Klein took out the key, opened his own door, and went into the empty rooms to find the Secret Book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the effort, he saw the old book bound by thick parchment directly in the closet of the first floor room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hard cover of the book is dark black with two lines of Hermes written in blush tones:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The Book of Secrets." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calaman". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein breathed a sigh of relief, not rushing to read it, but in this room, quickly creating a spiritual wall, holding himself to summon himself, himself Respond to your own rituals, and then throw Azick copper whistle, master key, all black eyes, extraordinary bullets, biotoxin bottles, Werewolf extraordinary features, "Book of Secrets" and other items together with the container on the fog, prepare Wait for the movement to calm down, and then decide which one to take and take it with you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he didn't even study the extraordinary characteristics of the werewolf and the specific conditions of the biotoxin bottle. After a brief wash, he lay down on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because researching items, reading books is a waste of time, and it is easy to bring trouble to the real world in this quiet night. Second, Klein is acutely aware of one of his current shortcomings, that is, the speed of his spiritual growth cannot satisfy more and more extraordinary abilities and magical items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just fought so fiercely, he is now mentally exhausted, his head is sore and sleepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the most burdensome to spirituality is the "paper man substitute", followed by the brooch to create "sun holy water", but not used tonight, again "Summoning the Light" and "Flame Jumping"... Klein yawned and used meditation to get rid of the state of being too tired and being too tight to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than ten seconds, he entered a dream, and various fragmented scenes alternated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the open space surrounded by abandoned warehouses, "Mechanical Heart" Come and go again, go again, the person responsible for this incident has changed from the team leader to the strongman at the deacon level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons Bernard’s brown hair was always messy and stretched out, even if he wore a hat, he couldn’t cover it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So many of the "Mechanical Hearts" members secretly joked that the deacon is probably using a bomb to get a haircut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Iconser, whose face is hard and clear, is holding an old silver mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are an eye-like decoration on each side of the mirror. They are based on black gems and look fascinating and charming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons circled around: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the rats in the sewers interfered with divination And the experts of the psychic, effective treatment of the scene, but this is a mysterious extraordinary world, there is no way to guarantee 100% success."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the conversation, he looked at the silver mirror in his hand and stroked the surface three times with his right palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop for two seconds, Icons took a deep breath, Shen Sheng:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Arrods, my question is, what happened to the people who just happened in this place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, there was a picture in the silver mirror: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fire, there was a figure floating in the air, he was wearing a black double-breasted The dress, wearing a half-height silk hat, is distorted, his face is blurred and difficult to see, and he is also painted with oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s feet, the flames go up and engulf him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the flash of water, the picture changed, and a middle-aged man with a dark red cloak appeared. His arm burned with a blazing flame, but his head was hidden. In the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenes alternated, and Icons and others saw a woman with a long black dress and a loose gold hair, but her The face is completely transparent, as if it does not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the lady, there are two men with black hair and a back that is pulled by a strange arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the end of the change, fixed in a bunch of flames whistling, "fireworks" gorgeous bloom, bright shining on one side of the picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a dreamy scene, the man wearing a black double-breasted long dress appeared again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was twisted and stretched laterally, facing forward, using the hand of the top hat, holding the chest, slightly squatting, and bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face is not only violently disturbed, but also vaguely showing the color of the oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons is waiting to ask the players what they think, a few lines of ancient Fossack words appear on the silver mirror:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the principle of reciprocity, it’s my turn to ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you answer the mistake, or lie, you will suffer Punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "punish" is red as blood, as if still dripping liquid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icone's face was distorted first, and immediately became extremely solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, next to the silver mirror, the water flashed and a new line appeared:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What is your sexual orientation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons stayed stunned and felt that all the players around him had cast their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 6 o'clock in the morning, the day is just bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleeping Klein woke up in the church bell on time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to past habits, he will turn over and continue to sleep until he gets up at eight o'clock, but this time, he sits up and looks around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I was not taken to the gas meter..." He let out a sigh of relief, refused to wash, walked four steps away from the bed, and entered the fog. Above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to study the gains of last night! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit in the position of a fool, Klein begins with a simple one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the black-green fangs and observed it for a few seconds, with a paper pen and a divination statement:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It works."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that you can use divination instead of experimentation, Klein just because of himself There are both physical objects, and Sharon and Maric know a lot about the "Prisoner", "Crazy" and "Werewolf". I feel that the front is enough, so try to see what can be gained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After meditation, he quickly entered the dream and witnessed a scene:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the perfect red moon, he screamed in the sky, his body grew black and white, his teeth were clear and clear...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his hands, 吱He slammed the steel plate that was not too thin...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rushed over the wilderness and stalked a group of grey wolves that were chasing at full speed behind him. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let the one-eyed but ruthless waiter rush to the enemy without fear of death...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also used a variety of artifacts to kill people, including bombs, and became more powerful in a state of anger and irrationality...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes, Klein roughly understands the characteristics of the "werewolf" and grasps the hidden dangers of this extraordinary feature:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the "werewolf" Tyre was under the full moon, the desire was extremely indulgent, and after the death, a relatively strong spiritual brand was left, and this extraordinary characteristic was used to match the magic. As extraordinary promotion must withstand the impact early on, otherwise out of control sign will appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this negative effect has not yet reached the level of the seal, and the extraordinary characteristics left by the "wolf" can still be used directly as the main material of the potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately... Unfortunately, the 'live corpse' Jason's extraordinary character was swallowed by the strange door... I don't know where the door leads, Is there any way to get back..." Klein regretted a distressed drop of the black-green fangs and picked up the brown translucent biotoxin bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He started the dream divination according to the previous method, but this time, he did not gain the confidence of detailed enlightenment, so he revised the divination statement to:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's positive and negative."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray in the dark dream world, Klein again I saw a scene of tragic scenes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone fell to the ground, scratching themselves, grabbing the skin and flesh and blood, and grabbing the forest bones...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone squinted at her head, her eyes lost focus, and her breath became weaker...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone vomited and spit In the end, convulsing to die...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone suddenly laughed and laughed out of breath...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Someone and their opponents fought in a sudden, suddenly both stopped, looking to each other, then, they hugged together, kissed together...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scene changes At the end The translucent brown vial was placed in a cup with water, the transparent liquid gradually turned amber and was drunk... The person holding the biotoxin bottle was weak first, then coughed, then touched Forehead, I feel that my hands are hot and my condition is getting heavier...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream is coming to an end soon, and Kline’s finger tapping the edge of the long table is quite a headache. Those revelations: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In conjunction with Steve's words, the previous revelation means that after the lid of the biotoxin bottle is opened, it will continue to diffusely to the outside. As for the poison in the opponent's meeting, it is purely random, even the holder can't control it. The poison inside is really bad..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The effective range can't be read from the revelation... Well, soak it in the water, drink the amber liquid in advance, can prevent poisoning? But how many minutes do you want to smoke? People who hold biotoxin bottles don’t even Open the lid, the body will gradually get worse, slowly get sick, slowly change Seriously, what is the specific time dividing line..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took advantage of the forehead and planned to have an experiment on the fog to confirm But he doesn't know if the "biotoxin bottle" can work here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the current state of the spirit, he is not afraid of poisoning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let's go back and study it... Klein turned his attention to the "Book of Secrets" bound by parchment in front of him. Go to the first page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
