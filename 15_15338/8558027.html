			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to Graves to see "Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina Edwards? Klein took a second and almost frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an unacceptable thing for him. Instead, he can take the opportunity to exchange and ask some trivial details that are easy to tell. I will be inspired to accumulate information for subsequent promotion and future acquisition of high-ranking potion formulas<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more friend, one more channel...Klein meditation in my heart From this sentence, it was dangerous to take out a heavy gold coin in the face of the "flame" Daniz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glittering gold coins rise and fall, falling on Klein's palm, and the numbers are facing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a negative, which shows that Klein and the "Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina's meeting in the port of Gragas is not dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein moved up and looked at Daniz, plainly speaking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thank you on behalf of the captain for accepting the invitation." Daniz quietly sighed, smiled and raised his eyes, his brow stretched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the wall clock:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go to the bathroom first." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the bathroom first? It means to wait for you to go out, use your identity to help me buy a ticket? Daniz's gaze subconsciously followed the movement of German Sparrow, and his keenness showed the other's meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After confirming with the divine divination on the fog, Klein washed his hands and left the bathroom, to Daniz: <br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?" Daniz pointed to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was wearing a coat and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually, no need? You can go directly to Elland and ask him to help get two tickets..." Deniz is very sincerely available. Take your own opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at him coldly, saying nothing, wearing a hat and opening the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz shuddered and took the second article of “purchasing false identification and buying two tickets from formal channels by changing the ability of appearance” It is recommended to swallow the belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He re-wrapped the scarf, pressed the low cap, and quickly caught up with German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly twenty minutes, Klein pointed to the front and noisy The local pass:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was Daniz not long ago Buy the "seaweed bar" of the black ticket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To..." Daniz didn't expect to wander again, and was a little bit stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, he has roughly described his experience of going out during the time, so I don’t understand why Gelman Sparrow is going back here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thoughts turned around, he had a guess, and blurted out: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, no Would you like to help me to retaliate back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is crazy going crazy, being a friend is quite good, from his adventure to Elland, they venture into Bansie It can be seen... Daniz heartfeltly expressed a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein gave him a glance and said nothing, stepping into the "seaweed bar." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, there is no need..." Daniz followed, not so powerfully persuaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as he is concerned, if it is not afraid of things going on, it will be too good to put the black guys on the cement and sink to the bottom of the sea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bar is full of excitement, echoing the music with local characteristics, bringing a psychedelic feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi took a hard look around and looked for the people who tried to eat black and black, as well as the famous pirate "Blue Eyes" Mi Si. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's Denier." Daniz casually introduced the black market businessman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, it’s too messy here, I don’t know if the guys are still there... he regrets in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein followed, and his right hand stroked the "squirming hunger" worn by the left palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and looked at Daniz, his face said as usual:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scarf was taken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His tone is like telling Daniz to buy a beer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? Daniz was there and suspected that he had got it wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein opened his mouth a little bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"take the scarf, don't let me Repeat the third time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why..." Daniz's words were blocked by cold and crazy eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly and doubtfully took off his scarf, inexplicably felt that everyone around him was looking at himself and recognized himself as a big pirate with a bounty of 5,500 pounds. , "flame" Daniz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein keeps a hidden crazy smile and continues to command:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take off the hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buy tickets in the past. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, Daniz seemed to be struck by a lightning bolt and almost jumped up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This way I will, I will be recognized..." Under the eyes of Galman Sparo, his voice is getting lower and lower.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he already understood what Gelman Sparo wanted to do.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to use the value of 5,500 gold pounds as a bait to catch those greed The pirates or the gangsters behind the gangsters! Shit! I just thought that he was a good friend, no, how can I think he is my friend! This scorpion raises! Daniz is constantly angry, He is constantly swearing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no way to resist because he knows what a crazy guy Gelman Sparrow is.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a madman who even wants to hunt for the pirate generals!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz reveals a distorted smile and swings back and forth slightly Take off The hat, walked slowly to Denil.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was surrounded by a line of sight and paused for two seconds, Huo Ran recovered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of drunks retire in the tide, leaving a spacious road, just like the ocean is separated,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See them In response, Daniz was worried and worried that the scene was unexpectedly good.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the prestige of the big pirates? This is what people look up to. Feeling? Damn, I heard someone say my name, someone is whispering "flame"... Daniz understands that he has been recognized, slamming forward, hanging his hands and preparing to fight.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Daniz? ‘flame’ Daniz! "In the crowd, "Blue Eyes" Mises blurted out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His subordinates looked at him with excitement:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, really 'flame' Daniz! 5,500 pounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do we want to do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mis licked the blue eyes, raised his left arm, and gave the subordinate head a slap:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You stupid!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Flame' Daniz if you are such a stupid I haven't known how many times I have died! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He dares to appear like this, certainly not afraid of being attacked! Is there a strong man behind him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mis suddenly panicked and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suspects that "Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina Edwards has secretly come to "The City of Generosity" Byam! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the gap between people, he saw a young gentleman standing at the entrance, wearing a black double-breasted coat and wearing a half-height silk Top hat, black hair, brown face, thin face, sharp edges and corners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without words, Mies’s inspiration tells him that this is a terrible existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His high inspiration has brought him a lot of problems, but also let him successfully escape more danger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!" He whispered his voice, told him, and then with the help of the alcoholic, like the previous Daniz, escaped from the back door of the bar. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz stunned and walked over to Denil, and bought two tickets to Gragas from the wrong and frightened opponent. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until he returned, he walked out of the bar under the eyes of Gelman Sparo, and he did not see who launched the sudden attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does not say that there are many dead people in the pirates? Sure enough, the temporary hurry, the more hasty trap, it is difficult to work... Abnormal often means wrong, of course, you can use the abnormal to scare the enemy... Unfortunately... Klein pressed the hat and followed Daniz. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Daniz is kneeling beside the gas streetlight, seeing Gelman Sparo out, barely smiled:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I wear a scarf and a hat?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, that coward! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Klein didn't pause and stepped up the other side of the street.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!Daniz's pupils shrank, and quickly followed, eagerly asked:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why suddenly escape? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has no sideways, and his voice speaks steadily:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to wait in the same place." Is the 'Civilizer' invitation? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said while pulling out the paper man, shaking out and burning into ashes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Niz realized this, although the cowards did not dare to attack themselves, but they had the courage to report. If they succeeded, they still have the opportunity to get some rewards!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Running into the secluded alley, seeing that Greman Spalo paused, he was free to wrap his scarf and put on his hat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are we going now? ? Daniz slightly breathed a sigh of relief.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Look for Elland. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz's mouth suddenly twitched twice and couldn't wait to throw a fireball.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Buy a ticket to the island of Tiris. Klein added that he wore the alley.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the first island after the South of Rothschild.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes, there are also boats to Gragas! Now everyone’s attention is on the passenger ship of Baiam to Gragas, and no one can think of us going around the port of Tirisnus! "Daniz is following.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
