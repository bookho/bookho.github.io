			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the mainland cities such as Beckland, Tingen, and Port of Pritz, the colonial islands such as Banxi lack gas, the street lamps on both sides are sparse, and the candle cages are covered with glass. Waiting to be lit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the wind started early today, no one went out in the evening, the candle did not shine in the scheduled time, the road was dark, purely The blushing moon in the clouds illuminates the outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the previous, the wind has been much more peaceful, at least Klein does not need to be distracted from his hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin fog is gradually filling, and the doors and windows of the two-story house are tightly closed, dark and dull, as if they have not lived for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, carrying a dimly lit lantern, holding a hard cane in one hand, walked quickly on the quiet street to the "flame" Daniz Pointed out the direction of the lime restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mist, the wind swirled, and Klein felt that his neck was a little cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted the right palm of the stick and made the collar of the double-breasted long dress straight and straight, completely covering the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, a picture suddenly appeared in his mind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the picture, a watermelon-sized black shadow emerged from the fog and instantly rushed to his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't think about it, he waved his arm and arm and yanked his cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden black shadow just got close, it was drawn in the front, and it took a long time to fly backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the light of the lantern, Klein finally saw what was attacking himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a head! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a head that has lost its body and hangs the esophagus! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head floats in the air, the face is like a moldy dried cheese, the skin with yellow-green liquid is slack and sagging, but the bones are outlined. Outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has only two black holes in the nose, the eyes are white and black, and the eyes are bulging out, the lips are rotted, and the blood is mixed. Very sharp teeth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dog! "Flame" Daniz saw this scene, his heart trembled and snarled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if he has explored a lot of treasures and fought many monsters, it’s rare to see such disgusting things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his hands, I don’t know when to put the classical revolver, the elbows down, and I’m about to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw a purely clear light falling from the sky and falling on the head that was drawn a little stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scream came out, and the dry head quickly evaporated and melted, and the smoke disappeared, and no traces remained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's weak! Daniz subconsciously evaluated one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German Sparo This monster is the "sun" route? It’s not like... It’s supposed to be a magical item... I haven’t noticed it yet, and Gelman Sparrow has found the enemy and made an attack, it’s really strong... Daniz will soon pay attention Moved to another aspect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His thoughts just precipitated, and the corner of his eye saw a similar head flying out from the side of the fog, trying to bite his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz pulled the trigger without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brass-colored bullets accurately hit the moldy head, hitting each other's eyebrows, leaning back and stagnating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in the left palm of Daniz's virtual grip, a group of reds quickly expanded and the flames began to linger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned forward, dragged his arm, and threw the flame out of it, letting it slammed into the stiff head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire is rising, red burning, the skin of the head is so fast, and the sound of Zizz is heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it did not suffer as much as it rushed forward, his mouth wide open, and he was about to bite the neck of Daniz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change is somewhat beyond the expectations of Daniz, almost too late to avoid, busy shrinking the neck, rolling forward, barely flashed this deadly damage . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his left palm, there is redness again, but the flame does not swell, but instead shrinks inward and stacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a second of work, Daniz evaded and cast the orange fireball with only the size of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball was controlled by his spirituality, drawing an arc halfway and flying into the mouth of the dry head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire flashed, and the explosion smashed the flying head from the inside out, and countless pieces of blood poured into the surrounding area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finally solved...Danizi stood up and took a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He discovered at this time that this kind of monster with only his head is actually not good to deal with, and that Gilman Sparo simply killed one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mainly the extraordinary ability of the "sun" field is very restrained by similar things! Daniz made a disdain in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the thoughts turn, he looks at him and finds that Gelman Sparrow has not waited for himself, carrying a cane and a lantern, and running in a small step. Running to the distance, the black dress rose slightly back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Dog! Wait for me... wait for me! Daniz's pupils shrank and strode up and strode up, not alone in a thin fog and bleak environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Green Lemon Restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donna looked at the white porcelain bowl placed in front of him and the dark red blood clot contained in it, remembering the strange horror of those guests who had just eaten, remembering The mooring blood from the neck of the headless cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her throat squirmed and almost vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna decided to give up this food, even if the strong fragrance had penetrated her nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ate some salad and mashed potatoes, waiting for the outside wind to stop, only the wall clock on the wall went so slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time passed by, a table customer successively settled and left the second floor, where it is getting quieter and more empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚! Donna only felt that the sound of their steps down the wooden ladder was so irritating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, she found that the trees outside were no longer shaking, and the ground was full of various sundries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wind stopped!" Donna pointed at the window with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her father, import and export businessman Uldi Blanche pinched his forehead and whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Donna, what about your table manners?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Donna is arguing, Krivis raises his palm Going to the next pressure: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At 7:40, the dinner is coming to an end. Let's go back as soon as possible. There is a lot of nights in Banxi. Good legend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every businessman who lives on the sea is more or less superstitious, especially when it comes to folklore, so Ur When Dillo was indulged, he agreed with the proposal of Crevis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly paid for the bill, led his family and bodyguards, and went down to the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crives is about to open the door to explore the road, a room next to a sudden screaming sound, scared Donna almost screamed, holding the younger brother Denton's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure walked out and glanced at them, plainly saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fog, most "Don't go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure is wearing a black tuxedo, no hat, a pair of glasses on the bridge of the nose, a fleshy face, almost round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fox, what do you want to say?" Krivis recognizes that this is the owner of the lime restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox has no expression to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Banxi, heavy fog and dramatic weather changes At night, it is best not to go out, do not respond to knocks, otherwise, may, encounter, bad things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There have been people left!" The more she listened, the more she was afraid, and she stressed loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox refers to the rooms on the first floor:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They choose to stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox’s voice just fell, and the door was opened lightly or heavily. The gentlemen and ladies came to the door and watched quietly. Going to the Donna family, watching quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, we should respect the customs here." Uldi Blanche said, "Staying here for one night does not delay us boarding." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the original experience of Krivis, this time should follow Fox's suggestion, stay in the lime restaurant, but he thought of German Sparrow's reminder is that it is a reminder of a powerful adventurer who can watch the "flame" Daniz! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banxi Port has hidden dangers...not specifically indoors or outdoors...Crivis quickly made a decision on Uldi Road:< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Blanche, please believe in my profession."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I see There are a lot of folk customs, and there is no real effect." Another bodyguard, Teague, said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice did not fall, the restaurant door suddenly screamed, and in the distance there were consecutive screams faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, there is a percussion, don't respond." Fox said a quick and unhurried sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uldi’s heart trembles, he has to choose to stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna looked at the gentlemen and ladies who stood at their doorsteps, only to see their eyes unspeakable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, we have to go back!" The little girl stressed almost screamingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crevis also felt the unspeakable repression and the cold that permeated from the inside of the bone, re-emphasizing his opinion:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have problems, it will be more dangerous to stay here. There are artillery on board and sailors with guns and knives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This reason convinced Urdi, he signaled to Krivis to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crevis waited until the percussion sound subsided, holding the gun in one hand, pulling it back and opening the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside wind is low, the darkness is deep, the fog is filled, as if there are many monsters hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna took his brother, Denton, and hid behind Cecil, and left the restaurant step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restaurant’s door suddenly closed, so they could never return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
