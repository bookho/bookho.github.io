She endured for a few tens of seconds before she slowly looked up and pretended to look around at random. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, she saw that the customer who had just entered was sitting at the bar and waiting for wine and lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft micro-volume yellowish hair, wild beast-like dark brown eyelids, slightly drooping corners, lonely and sinister temperament... The pupils gradually overlap with the image in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who is suspected of being a murderer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Killing Williams' murderer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh once again burying his head and slowly stuffing the remaining food into the mouth. After a few minutes, she put the plate together with the wine glass and put it on the bar. Then she squinted and left the Workers' Union pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Because the boots are much higher, she effectively covers the most obvious features. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the way, take a slow pace, find a secluded location, and observe the people who come in and out of the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a while, she finally found an acquaintance, living in the Eastern District, working at the East Bayer Dock, the technical worker Burton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man likes to give himself a bad rye beer at noon or in the afternoon, his salary can only bear this beer, and he can’t do it every day. drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughing action swiftly smashed the past, took a shot of Burton's shoulder, and lowered the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It's me, Hugh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hugh?" Burton looked up and down the short man from the side, almost didn't recognize that it was some Eastern District. The street is known as the "arbitrator" Hugh Dilcha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have something to ask you." Hugh pointed to the corner next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berton doubts follow, and when he comes to the hidden place, he asks in an awkward way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Doing a rewarding mission?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard that he was also a bounty hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Hugh was in the middle of the scene, took out five 1p-pound copper coins and threw the ball. "Do you know the tall man in the pub? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean such a high, yellowish hair, very fierce one?" Burton stroked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Take a folded portrait and take it out, "You must confirm it completely."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is him. He has been here often in the pub for two or three months. He has never seen him before. He is very fierce. He is not reasonable at all. The fight is very powerful. You better not to provoke him. Burton carefully looked at the portrait and sincerely persuaded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I just saw that person, just like when I was a child, I was very dangerous, not an opponent, I had to avoid it immediately... In a tone, ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know who he is in close contact with?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I don't know, he is very unsocial, rarely speaks, and no one knows what he is calling. We have given him a nickname, called 'Giant.'" Burton grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about it and asking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides the pub, where have you met him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can ask your friend the same question, remember, must be a friend who is trustworthy "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burton recalled the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I went to the dock union to do business, Well, at the dock union in East Byron Dock, I occasionally see him appearing around, Hugh, why aren’t you a union? You are so fair, and the guys not only receive 1.5 sules per week. Membership fees, when we have to go to other docks and we have to raise a family, we will give us half of the salary!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord, this is all For a good life, we must help each other. However, they just organized a strike and returned to the lawyers who were sent by the rich, and our situation did not improve at all!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop, stop." He pressed the right palm of his hand. "Besides, you haven't seen it anywhere else." People'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, my friends shouldn't have it. After all, we often discuss him privately." Burton answered with a positive tone. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have no more to say, gave the five copper pennies to each other:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please You drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What I just asked, don't tell anyone, it will be very dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not fallen, she has turned and walked out of the corner, heading to the dock union in East Byron Dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, Hugh saw the two-story yellow building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her canvas coat over and exposed it, revealing the patch inside, and turning herself from a short worker into a tramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few tramps who looked at the corner of the street, shook their noses, and sat with them in the past, and the line of sight was intermittently swept across the street. Dock Union - when someone comes in and out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, and the weather is cold, enduring the harsh environment, and constantly observing the situation of the dock union and surrounding areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clearly remembers Williams’ insistence on drinking, and remembers the mood of seeing the newspaper that day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mood makes her more patient than ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the dock union came out of seven or eight people, they went to the opposite cafe in groups to prepare for lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hume your eyes and carefully scan every passerby to confirm their looks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No suspicious person...Hugh is ready to take back the line of sight and wait for the next batch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吱嘎, the door of the cafe was pulled open, and the heat inside suddenly rushed out. A man couldn’t help but take off his own Phnom Penh glasses. Wipe the cuffs with a mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hallowly looked at it, his eyes suddenly solidified:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That corner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always sneer at the image of a smile! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhous? Hugh suddenly turned back and didn't dare to look again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s skin color was short and thick, his face was sharp and angular, and it was very different from the portrait. Only the eyes and mouth were given to her. Familiar feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the feelings of everyone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it Lalhous? Will it be Llanus? Resting his head and staring at the slate on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer's home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearty lunch, the host and guests gathered in the living room to chat and agreed to wait for Texas to play together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some funny rumors and funny stories are intermittently reverberating, Klein keeps a smile, interrupts a few words from time to time, and sees the two children of Samuel’s family lively In and out of the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And next to him, Jurgen Cooper is still a serious expression, occasionally providing legal advice for everyone's discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled, micro-body, depressed voice asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will Don't you feel bored?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, their topic is very interesting." Jurgen took a hard look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein suddenly stunned and asked again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you laugh?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgan frowned slightly and looked at him doubtfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why laugh? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Klein twitched his mouth and didn't know how to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was going to make a joke, saying that the other person is very similar to his cat Brody, always so serious, but the sound of the illusion of the illusion . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female... "Justice" found so useful information on the clues I provided so quickly? Klein stood up and fainted: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went to the bathroom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the bathroom, Kline locked the door of the house, took four steps back and entered the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His judgment is very accurate, and the voice is from Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein suddenly has some tension, half expecting that half is dignified to spread spirituality and listen to the other's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the customary name, "justice" truthfully describes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are in the dock area The Workers Union Pub in East Byron Dock found the clues you provided, and the other's nickname is 'Giant.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tracking the 'giant' haunts, they Also found in the dock union of East Byron Dock, who was suspected of Lalhous, but could not be sure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are afraid to contact Lalousus for the time being. Because 'Giant' is very powerful and dangerous, and can only continue to wait for opportunities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They asked at the same time to confirm whether they were notified after Lalhous The police department, receiving a reward?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalus has a very powerful and dangerous helper... Does he have any other helpers? Is there a certain force behind him? Why is it so violent to kill, what is he planning in the dock union? A series of questions flashed in Klein's mind, making him feel that things are much more complicated than expected, full of fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the last request, his answer is undoubtedly agree, and even advises the other party to directly report to the church of the goddess of the night, because there is a leak in the police department. may. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the night of the goddess church kill Lalhus, it is also revenge! Klein silently said a word, there is a strong urge to immediately confirm whether the person is Lalhous, lest the wait is too long, there are variables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a breath, pressed his emotions and untied the cuffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Going to the dock union to confirm that Llanus is dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed After seven times, Klein opened his eyes and looked at the citrine pendant, and found it motionless and completely still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divination failed? Klein frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He changed another sentence and changed the way of divination, but the result is still a failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
