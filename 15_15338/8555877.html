			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The royal family..." Klein took the letter sent by Essinger Stanton and said to himself silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and saw the raindrops falling out of the window, and the gas street lights exude a circle of quiet halo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the living room, the coffee table is neat, a few stacks of newspapers are placed in a corner, and there is no sound around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat on the sofa, leaning forward slightly, silent for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly ten minutes, he spit out the turbidity, shook his head, and slowly and seriously threw the letter in his hand into the trash can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly stood up and went to the second floor without expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter from Essinger Stanton in the trash can quietly ignited and quickly rolled up, turning into a dark ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday morning, Klein stood in front of the wash mirror and used his right thumb And the middle finger presses the temples on both sides, and squats slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he unscrewed the faucet, buried his body, took the cold tap water and poured it on his face, washing his face in a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He became a spirit again. He hung up the towel and went to the first floor. He simply made a single-sided cooked omelette with buttered toast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, a cup of black tea with a few lemon slices is both thirsty and greasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When breakfast was spent and the remaining newspapers were leisurely viewed, Klein suddenly heard the doorbell making a jingle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who? New commission? Is it 'the heart of the machine' has explored the mausoleum of the Amon family? No, not so fast..." Klein committed a crime. Put the napkins and newspapers and walk slowly to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When holding the handle, his mind naturally emerged from the door:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp It was a middle-aged gentleman dressed in a meticulous manner. The shirt was white and white, and the thick gray-blue vest perfectly embraced the belly. The long tuxedo dress had distinct lines and no trace of flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gentleman is wearing a pair of bright leather shoes and can’t see the signs of rain and mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears double white woven gloves, two enamels are doped with a few silver hairs, the face is heavily grainy, and the light brown eyes are serious. Does not contain a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know... Klein muttered and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me, who are you looking for?" he asked politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged gentleman took off his hat and pressed it on his chest to perform a trick with the most standard posture:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I am a housekeeper, in lieu of my master to invite you, Mr. Sherlock Moratti."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do I know your master? What did he look for for me?” Klein was full of fog. At this time, he had noticed that the carriage was parked across the cement road. The outer casing was dark and thick, and the inside of the window was covered with curtains. At first glance, it was not ordinary goods. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low-key reveals luxury... Klein stared at him and suddenly found a prominent coat of arms in the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main body of the coat of arms is a vertical downward sword, and the handle of the sword has a red crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This..."The Sword of Judgment"... represents the "Judge of Judgment" of the royal family of Augustus! Klein’s heart glimpsed and broadly understood the origins of the butler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professional and rigorous steward did not care about his review, showing a polite smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You and my host have not met, but should be called You have to know that you have been providing him with clues to the organization symbolized by the tarot cards, and he has paid the money you need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s the big man that Talim mentioned. I’ve been using plausible fake news to swindle funds, and even pass the cost of old Kohler’s reimbursement to the past... This is not a good rejection of the other’s invitation, especially Tallim is still dead... Klein has been indulging for two seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does your master find me in the past for the death of Tallim?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Tallim is his friend, he is sad and confused for his death, and he heard that you were at the scene." Speaking clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I don’t... Klein wants to deny it, but in the end he can only nod:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes, I watched Tallim die in front of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a sad and regrettable thing." In good faith, "Would you like to accept the invitation of my master?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still have reason to refuse? That looks very suspicious! Maybe you are on the spot... Klein looks at the other side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have nothing in the morning."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, Mr. Moriarty, please." The old butler bent slightly, extending the right palm of the white glove, pointing to the carriage opposite the concrete road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哎, always avoiding contact with big people, but the result is that because of Tlim’s death, he has to face the one behind him... I don’t know if it will Inspired by more or more in-depth background investigations... I have to prepare the plan ahead of time, ready to give up this position... and, as soon as possible, get the characteristics of the human skin and the hair of the deep sea Naga, as soon as possible Promoted to "no face"! In that way, my ability to resist risks has doubled! When Klein put on his coat, put on his hat, and walked toward the carriage with the royal coat of arms, he had already thought about the following things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the servant carried by the old butler helped him open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the thick brown carpet, look at the wooden cabinets with red, white, champagne, lanzi, black rand and one crystal Grinding the cup, Klein was a bit restrained for a moment, looking for a window to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Lang Qi refers to the strong distilled spirits produced by pure malt. There are many kinds, such as the “strong lyrics” that sailors love to drink, and now in the cabinet The bottles are obviously high-end goods. As for Heland, it refers to the strong distilled liquor mixed with other grains. Like Langzi, it belongs to the Lun characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the carriage drove through the wet streets, Klein asked casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Queens?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, my host is waiting for you at the Red Rose Manor on the outskirts of Queens." The old housekeeper did not hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be the royal estate... Klein thought about it, smiled and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Can you tell me the identity of your owner now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler’s waist is getting straighter and the chin is raised: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is the descendant of the 'founder', 'protector', he is the descendant of the 'strong man', he is the fifth child of His Majesty, pull Earl of Sting, His Royal Highness Prince Edessack Augustus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original is the third prince, the penultimate prince, but there seems to be two Eleven-two years old... Klein recalls the occasional descriptions of the Craig Club and newspapers and magazines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage drove across a street, from the area with the artificial lake to the northwest, it took more than an hour, and finally arrived at a very large area. Manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
