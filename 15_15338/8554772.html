			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After checking up and down, Klein confirmed that there was no strange place in the White House, and that the couple had not left their hair, obviously it was against someone. Use the means of divination to pursue them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the bedroom full of dolls, stepping back four steps, into the fog, intending to use divination for final confirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before getting into the subject, he showed with interest the girl doll who was almost equal to himself, and like in the past in Tingen Like the illusion of divination, the sacred sun emblem, pick up the dark red round pen and write the next sentence on the tan parchment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The origins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the pen and hold the paper. Klein leaned back on the back of the chair and whispered quietly, slowly adjusting the spirit to the state of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a full seven times, his throat turned deep, his eyes fell and he entered a sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray world, he saw the craftsman of the dolls making an unusually focused production and saw that the red girl "girl" was placed in the doll. The house, seeing Emlin White. The eyes could not move out of the wallet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the picture is fixed in the bedroom where Klein is currently in, the hair is slanted and combed, handsome but slightly delicate and proud of the vampire Emlin White. Sitting on the edge of the bed, staring at this doll, and all other dolls of different sizes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a fanatic of the doll... Klein opened his eyes and reached for his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he waved his hand and let the pop figure with the appearance disappeared over the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, he picked up the round pen again and wrote the new divination statement again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The scene of the dead in the past ten years at No. 48, Hewan Avenue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- According to the statement of nearby residents, the White family moved here no more than ten years So, Klein can lock in a specific scope, and he believes that if the White family is just a good monster on the surface, they have actually been making a disappearance in order to suck the warm and delicious blood, then they can’t always let Things happened at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long decade, there will always be a few accidents, as long as they don’t close their hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After scrutinizing the divination statement, Klein repeated his meditation and meditation and quickly fell into a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray world, his eyes are sometimes dark, sometimes snowflakes become dots, sometimes broken and split, but there is no picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the result of divination:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 48, Hewan Avenue, has not died in the past ten years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all aspects of the situation, you can preliminarily judge that the White family is a vulgar who is the thief of the law-abiding thief... Klein looks at the mottled bronze long table in front Wrapped in spirit and fell into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning to the real world, he carefully handled the traces left by himself, leaving the original No. 48, Hewan Avenue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not make a final decision on this, but detoured to the Hewan Police Station, where a thief drunk was brought inside and copied to the pipeline. Under the backdrop of the scene, it was easy to sneak into the archives room and boldly lit the gas table lamp inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Klein found out the missing records of the last ten years, and slammed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police officers on duty from time to time outside the door, but the archives in their eyes have no light to leak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing suspicious..." I don't know how long it took, and Klein, wearing black gloves, put the file back in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he turned off the gas table lamp, in the deep darkness, took off his hat, pressed his chest and handed a bow to the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back all the way back to Minsk Street, Klein took a shower, changed the clothes, sat down at the desk, and spread the map of the Baker Lande that was first purchased on the steam train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first found the rose flower street in the southern part of the bridge, which is the harvest church, and the priest Utravsky is the bishop of this church, and Emlin White was imprisoned in the basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, Klein moved his eyes and figured out the names and layout of the streets around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance should not be too impatient, too eager to achieve, and let the audience put in little by little... Klein whispers, spreads the letter, and drops the pen:< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Stuart Detective:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if you have found that ang Mlin White? I have been paying attention to you recently. One of my informants told me today that he had seen this person on the Tutwa Street in the southern part of the bridge. Of course, he just said that it is very similar to the person in the portrait. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the pen, Klein folded the letter paper neatly, stuffed In an envelope with a black stamp of 1 pence denomination.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The waves are undulating, the vast sea of ​​Sonia.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Blue Avenger" ran smoothly, without the slightest shaking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger Wilson sat in the captain's room, holding a brass sex sextant, but his eyes closed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, a smile suddenly appeared on his face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I finally digested..." Alger Open your eyes, raise your hands, and make a little blue everywhere.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blues are mingling and become a huge wave that swept forward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger’s hands are pressed, this giant Suddenly disintegrated, turned into countless raindrops, and fell to the deck.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For nearly four months, his "voyager" potion was finally digested!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, he not only floated on the sea for a long time, completed various tasks delivered by the church, but also consciously explored the new waterway to find undiscovered people. The island, after several setbacks, finally got a little harvest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reversed the digestion of the potion, allowing him to basically master his own Family Code.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core is close to the sea, is the mastery of the channel and the weather information, is the exploration and discovery!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consistently deep Alger couldn't help but leave the seat, pacing back and forth in the captain's room, and imagining the future of eagerness:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the formula of the "Wind" potion and find the corresponding extraordinary materials, then take the church promotion sequence 6 and repeat the same process. The "sea singer" who became the sequence 5 during the year...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, he must always serve as the captain of the "Blue Avenger", not entering the interpersonal relationship The team of punitive officers, so as not to be secretly exposed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the promotion sequence 5, gain enough strength, I will be able to return to it secretly... Alger Subconsciously looked to the right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze seems to penetrate the heavy ship and the sea, falling onto an ancient and hidden island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger is not worried about his future promotion within the church. When he completes his wish, he can go all out to seek improvement in position! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, he will continue to pretend to be Sequence 7 in Sequence 5, and then drink a "Wind" potion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will increase his extraordinary characteristics, strength and digestion, but not harm his own safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
