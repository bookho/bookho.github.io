			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people have a common dream? Klein repeated in his heart a "star above the" Jia Delia's words, vaguely understand the current situation: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dangerous sea of ​​night will be here all The dreams of creatures are connected together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature that did not fall asleep at this time, because the spirit is not in this dream territory, will lack the necessary protection and be attacked by the nameless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why such an attack would lead to a disappearance rather than a death on the spot, Klein had not experienced similar things in person and could not guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking in the turn of the room, Klein took his eyes back from Capella, looking back at the magnificent city across the cliff, thinking curiously:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the world is really a dream of a local creature, what is the dream of this city beyond imagination?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared for a few seconds and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is its name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the name of a city that may exist in this myth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The star above will" Gardelia looks at the front, said with a nightmare: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I don't know... every time I enter the dream here, I have a chance to see it, but I can never get close.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She said, this and the dusk of Fossac The temple is a bit like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She should have her own guess, but never told me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She? The "mysterious queen"? The Dusk Giant Hall is the seat of the God of War Church... Klein looked around and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to take a look around."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that the "Future" will not only stay in this area for a few days, he will certainly encounter more nights, and will enter this dream world more times. Therefore, in order to prevent accidents and harvest information, certain exploration is necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And exploration is undoubtedly a need for a companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia De Li Ya is still sitting on his knees, his tone is still erratic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No interest "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......This is not a mature pirate general who should say something, it can be more euphemistic, Ms. "Hidden", you are now like a wayward The girl... Klein stunned and almost suspected that he had misunderstood, which contradicted the "stars above him" in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of Gilman Sparo also has a side that is not afraid of being dirty and not afraid of hard work, he immediately relieved, and quickly got a guess:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hidden" Jia Delia is not completely awake in a dream, can recognize that he is dreaming but can not effectively control! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, she will unconsciously express some of her inner feelings and peaceful moments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder she said that she could never get close to the miraculous city opposite, because she didn’t have the conscious consciousness at all... Klein thought about it and deliberately tried it. Asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We may be able to find something here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. "Jia De Li Ya did not hesitate to answer, but never shook his head. "I want to wait here, wait!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a half-awake state... Ryan judged from the reaction and tone of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer wastes time and turns to boulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stepped on the ground and looked back at the subconscious: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The star above will" Jia Delia still sits there with his knees, nothing else around The presence of human beings, the dusk of the opposite city solidified, spilled on her body, dragging her shadow long, and the shadow created by the dead yellow trees intertwined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain wind is blowing lightly, the shadows are swaying, and Jia Delia has no movements, stubbornly waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time you need a "psychologist" to interpret the mood of the dream, which has nothing to do with the revelation of divination... Klein snorted and looked around , looking for the direction of exploration. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that the left and right are black buildings of the monastery, and there are towering walls separating them from the cliff, no matter where you want to explore, unless Jumping directly to the cliff, otherwise you can't bypass the monastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there is no other choice, Klein went directly to the dark door of the monastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This door is nearly ten meters high and does not look like it is for humans. Klein looked at it for a few seconds, took a breath, extended his hands and pressed the door. Sew on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the cymbal sounded immediately, and the heavy weight of the door exceeded Klein’s imagination. His muscles swelled up and his face rose red, but only slightly Inciting the target, unable to push away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately this is a dream, as long as there is a logical belief, it can enhance the power, do not need to really open the "squirming hunger"... Klein spit out The tone of the left, the glove of the left palm was pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of green and flashing, he gained the power of "live corpse", his arms thickened and his legs suddenly expanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zha! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy friction sounded and the door slowly opened, revealing the scene inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two faint towers and a black building are connected to each other by a covered bridge, enclosing a wide gray stone square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square is covered with potholes, a huge arrow is inserted, and several fires are burning. It seems that there have been attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein crossed the doorway and entered the square. Unexpectedly, Frank Frank, Nina, Ottolov and others were here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is their dream? It’s not like... or, everyone’s dreams are limited to themselves and then appear randomly somewhere in the world? Klein was not sure about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franke Lee is closest to him, holding a shovel and shoveling gravel, next to the white bread, toast, and toast that had fallen to the ground. Pan-fried fish and other foods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is he going to do with them? Even dreaming is planting... Klein leaned over and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank does not stop, but his face is smiling:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have cultivated some small things, they need to sleep in the soil for a while to grow Yamato reproduction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What use are they?" Klein asked curiously and worriedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are a hybrid of bacteria that can make bulls It also produces milk, so that we will harvest more milk and let more people drink good milk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let go of those bulls... Klein's cheeks twitched: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can it succeed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The effect is ok But I am worried that they may not breed." Frank frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, he passed Nina and the sailor Ottolov, who were sitting next to a collapsed stone pillar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you thinking about getting older, leaving the pirate group, finding a man to marry, finding a place to settle? I don't think anyone wants to drift in life. At sea." Ottolov took off his apex and showed a slightly gray hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes and tone told Klein that his subtext is: If you want to, can you consider me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Nautical Chang, your age can be Nina’s father, you have to consider your own body... Klein passing by hears the conversation. I couldn't help but vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina sipped her drink and looked in one direction:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, that's not the life I thought about.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before joining you, I tried to settle down on the east coast of Fossack, no longer doing pirates, but I am completely I can't stand that dullness, every day is to smash wood, move things, have to stay at home in the evening, can't go to the bar, can't go hunting in the wild, and haven't changed a bit! And had to endure all kinds of accusations, endure those annoying guys, they wanted to hit the meal had to worry about the police! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s still good on the boat, although most of the time it’s boring, but often you can go to different places and see different things, huh, even the most boring time, Can also ruin those guys, train them to become qualified pirates, and tell them that the best performer of each month can spend the night in my room, then watch them excited and excited to enjoy the torture, of course, overnight and go to bed It’s two things, it’s not the same. I have to look at my mood.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True. Female pirates... Everyone wants to get different... gram Ryan commented on it in a pertinent way, and did not think that Nina’s thoughts must be wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t care about her choices, but if she murders and robs, I don’t mind using her head for a bounty next time... ... Klein took his eyes back and came to the place where the black buildings and the entrances of the towers were suspected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, he glanced sideways and saw that the shadows in the corner seemed normal, but in fact there were different feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bloodless" Heath Doyle? Even in a dream, he is hiding in the shadows? According to my effective psychological knowledge, this is an extremely insecure performance... Klein pushed the door of the entrance, which is also nearly ten meters high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his voice, his gaze suddenly solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rear of the main entrance is a vast hall supported by two rows of stout pillars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no candlelight in the hall, it is very dark. With the opening of the main entrance, the outside light shines in and makes it clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw a colorful wall painting on the wall and on the dome. They were connected to each other without leaving a gap, so that there was a great sacred place. feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure is facing Klein, holding a long giant wood with his axe, I don’t know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure is wearing a white shirt and a black vest, unlike any pirate on board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other people in this sea area? Or the gazing decks staring at my mysterious eyes? Klein's mood sank, slowed down, and stood guarded, and came to the side to see the figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a young man with a short blond hair that is three or seven open, with green eyes focused and serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing? Where is this place?" Klein cautiously said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intuitively believes that the other person is not the master of those mysterious eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man raised his hand and touched his earlobe without turning his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
