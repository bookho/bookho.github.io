			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the "Future", Anderson Hood held the boat with both hands and saw the undead army under the "black ocean" retreat, rushing to hit you I stepped on the back deck of the "Black Tulip" and saw that Gelman Sparrow pressed his hat to the right hand, descending from the sky, and steadily falling on the opposite side of "Hell Admiral" Ludwell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of scene is difficult to reflect under the shadow of deep red or green, under the shadow of ghosts and various strange spiritual creatures. The beauty of words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool! It’s the craziest adventurer... Anderson has sincerely praised, and immediately thought of another thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German.Spao before flying It seems that I have thrown a spell in front of myself, and I also specially demonstrated the opening of the mantra! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He meant...Anderson Hood looked down and found the spell made of white tin at his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the "Black Tulip", the body arched slightly, and the eyes locked in the enemy's Klein heart was not as cold and calm as his surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson, this guy is coming over with a spell. I am very likely to be a big man, even dangerous... the silver mask and two pale flames in the scorpion At the same time, Klein prayed silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the mysterious eyes of the gaze deck are watching, because of the opener of the dream world mentioned by Anderson Hood, he cautiously gave up immediately Pray to yourself, then go to the fog and use the "Poseidon Scepter" to respond to the option, and warn yourself not to expose the problem as much as possible. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that "squirming hunger" plus "fire" gloves plus "magician" various extraordinary ability plus "Sea God field" different spells, can make it own The strength of the battle with "Hell Admiral" Ludwig, and the attraction of the Azick copper whistle to the undead and the spiritual world of the Necromancer can help him to abolish the most powerful means of "powerful psychics" - For the sequence 5 of the "Death" route, as long as it does not exceed the necessary limit, in the face of a certain number of medium-sequence enemies, always play more and less! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Klein doesn’t think that he will win the “Hell Admiral” Ludwell and even kill the other person in this situation. The main battlefield is on the "Black Tulip". With reference to the application of "Stars above" to "Future", the brains know that the situation is not so optimistic, and the second is "Hell Admiral" Lutherville is currently the most senior The pirate general, backed by the "king of the five seas" and "spiritual group" two forces, the magical objects and even the seals will not be much more than Klein, perhaps more than, in addition, many rumors pointed out that he owns A ring left by the ancient god of death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus the sequence itself is indeed lower than the "Hell Admiral", Klein not only does not have a hunting to be successful, crazy adventurers play a further excitement, but introvert Tight, do not dare to care, just looking forward to the doom-ridden "strongest hunter" to fly over as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the two people at the same level teamed up, there is no small hope to defeat or contend with Ludwell who lost the army of the dead, give the star "Gaddria and her pirates vacated the time and space to clear the patchwork monsters!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts flashed past, and Klein did not hesitate to launch an offensive, allowing the "poisonous fog" stolen by the "fire" gloves to spread out quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can see that there are so many twists and turns in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell Admiral" Ludwell wearing an exaggerated triangular hat and silver mask also lifted the always clenched left fist at the same time, opening the five fingers , with the palm of your hand aligned with Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, the front deck was shrouded in a thrilling yellow-green mist, and in front of Ludwig, the illusory light broke out first, and then swirled at a point. , collapsed inward, and built a slightly blurred bronze door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bronze door is covered with a variety of mysterious patterns, with a deep and dead feeling that cannot be described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops, the door swayed and cracked a gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap is invisible darkness, like the deepest and deepest night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of indescribable eyes are hidden in the deep darkness, densely packed, everywhere, but unable to see the concrete look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bloody arm with no skin stretched out, a black vine that protruded from the baby's face extended, and a palm with its mouth full of teeth caught it. They screamed and laughed. , crying, shouting, scrambling to capture everything outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings a horrible suction, and the chill is so cold that the hurricane of the frozen bones can be blown out of the air, pushing something to those weird things, Pushed to the gap in the bronze gate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow-green "dark fog" was emptied, and Klein couldn't help but lean forward and squat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gloves of his left palm immediately became dark, with both the evil of the night and the honor of the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s brown scorpion was deep and dark, his left arm opened to the side and made a “please” gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrible suction that swept the front deck suddenly changed its orientation, and the white bones and rotting corpses that were heading for the back deck were "grabbed" one by one. To the gap in the gate, let them be entangled in the black vines with baby's face, hugged by bloody arms, dragged to the area where the eyes are innumerable after the bronze gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twist"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "distortion" of the "corrupted baron"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein "distorted" the goal of the mysterious gate, replacing himself with the scorpion and living corpse on the "Black Tulip". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, he is still affected by the aftermath of the huge suction, so that the pace is difficult, unable to take advantage of agile and fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cap he wore has been blown up by the hurricane, swirling in the air, fluttering to follow the untouched creatures in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "Hell Admiral" Ludwell wearing an exaggerated triangle hat raised his right arm and extended his palm forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right side of his upper body is illusory and seems to belong to ghosts and grievances. His arms and arms are constantly extended, and the distance is not too close. The palm of the hand grabs the enemy pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hurricane’s voice disappeared, and a slight low cry came into Klein’s ear, causing his body to numb, and the blood seemed to be frozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the pale palm is getting closer and closer, he seems to be possessed by the spirit of grievances, and it is difficult to make an effective response. Death is coming, desperately feeling that their vitality is passing faster and faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any resistance, Ludwell’s pale, illusory right palm grabbed Klein and pinched him into a thin paper man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper man was covered with dark green corrosion marks and was quickly torn into powder by a hurricane that did not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the side of the bronze door, Klein’s figure instantly appeared, and the glove of the left palm was dyed with pure sunlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately stood up straight and opened his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred beam of light that haunts the golden flame falls from the air and hits the bronze gate full of mysterious patterns! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun suddenly broke out, and Kline was almost unable to open his eyes, and the terrible door of "Hell Admiral" Ludwig "made" not only shook himself. Shake, a lot of blurring, even the exaggerated suction from the inside has been weakened, the black vines and bloody arms with baby's face evaporated more than half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, more of the weird arms and more twisted creatures have rushed to the door seams, trying to squeeze out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is about to continue to use the "Sacred Light" of the "Light of the Priest" to purify the bronze gate, "Hell Admiral" Ludeville's pale giant The palm has been caught crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hurriedly fluttered, continually rolling, avoiding the aftermath of the hurricane and the soul of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, twice, three times, his body slammed and leaped out, "squirming hunger" has no idea when it will become like gold Cast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
