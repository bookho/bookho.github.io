			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that the simple task given by Mr. Fool was just to examine the two people who might join the party. The general content is to find the person on the portrait, and that person Determined in Beckland... Alger Wilson tried to remember what happened during the last meeting, and it became increasingly impossible to understand how it relates to the hotbed of evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you looking for someone? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it’s still not dangerous...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple task of Mr. Fool Behind the hidden deep purpose? Is this a silent contest between gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted people" instantly thought of a lot, almost blurted out and asked "justice", trying to spend the price to understand the specific process of the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as a veteran official extraordinary, driving a "voyager" of an ancient ghost ship, he is experienced, the city is extremely deep, and forced to endure Impulse, I plan to first ask the Beckland what has happened recently through the internal channels of the Storm Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "Justice" Audrey's sigh of "Footer" is a glimpse of it, and I suddenly understand the things of Lalhous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original deity of Lalhous is the initial reliance of the "real creator" on the real world...and the harshness of the eastern district, the wharf area, and the factory area The situation is based on the rapid breeding and expansion of the fast-moving bed... "Footer" with a simple task to stop the "real creator" huge conspiracy, saved the entire Beckland! Audrey looked at the top of the bronze long table and blinked brightly, unconsciously filled with the color of worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the gloomy and introverted "world" laughs out loud:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes Every time I saw and heard that a lot of child labor died in my teens, because most of the workers who lived in the 30s were extremely tired and in a bad environment, I barely survived the test before but I was unemployed and lacked protection. The aging people who can wander in the streets and die in hunger and cold, I don't doubt the existence of evil spirits. They are on the ground, in the eastern district, the dock area and the factory area."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Oh, even the survey report mentioned that workers in some factories are hard to live for five years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eastern part of Beckland, there is a saying that the resident who lives there, the generation of grandfather must belong to a foreigner, no exception.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real meaning of the sentence is that people there will not have a third generation and cannot have grandchildren."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poverty, hunger, Their children are very thin and hard to adapt to hard work, and they will quickly die in Beckland, not to mention getting married and having the next generation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First After hearing the words "World", Audrey, who said so much, suddenly fell into deep shock and confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know anything about it... I read newspapers and magazines that only mentioned the residents of the Eastern District. It’s hard work. ... Audrey's eyes have obviously lost their focus for a moment, and she feels that her perception of the kingdom to the world seems to have been completely subverted. Suddenly, she deeply understood why Mr. "The Fool" had to sigh like that, why should he say such an era, such a Beckland, such a The Eastern District, the Docklands and the Factory District are hotbeds for the evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t go on like this anymore! Otherwise, one day Beckland will be destroyed! "Justice" Audrey Huodi has a strong impulse. I want to go back and do more understanding. I want to remind my father, Count Earl, to use the ability of "audience" and "reader" to guide the improvement of the Eastern District and the Docklands. The bills and policies of the poor living conditions in the factory area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the bronze table, "The Fool" Klein quietly observed the reaction of Miss "Justice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just deliberately lamented such a sentence, and used the trumpet "World" to give a detailed explanation, that is, to be a noble, there is still a simple "justice" The young lady recognized the seriousness of the problem and promoted the transformation of the kingdom through her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before becoming a "no face", I must clearly remember that I can’t personally mix this kind of thing... He set up such a piece for himself Boundary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Mr. Fool, thank you for saving Beckland. Your sighs also made me understand the root of the problem. Thank you, Mr. World, you let me know a lot of things I didn't know before." Audrey convinced her emotions and sincerely thanked the two gentlemen who were sitting at the top and bottom of the ancient long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saved Beckland? “Inverted people” Alger is no stranger to the situation in the Eastern District, the factory area and the Docklands. More is the description in the mouth of Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What exactly did this make? He frowned in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik listened quite seriously. Although he couldn’t understand it, he listened carefully and wanted to know more. The situation of the area where Mr. "downside down", "May" and "World" are located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to Miss Justice, Klein just smiled and did not respond more. Instead, he turned his attention to "downside down." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger suddenly understood what he meant and quickly made the last page of the promised Russell Diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the air out of the air and looked at it casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"January 10 On the 4th, I found a problem. If the unconscious high-sequence items are not sealed, they will unconsciously attract the low-sequences of the same route to come nearby, and the intersection will occur. The higher the original sequence, the easier it is. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, this situation does not seem to be always there, but intermittent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This diary suddenly made Klein spiritual, because he had a similar guess before. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to Beckland and found himself soon to meet with the Secret Society and the extraordinary people of the "Divination" approach, thus falling into extremes Passively extremely dangerous situations, but also obtained the corresponding sequence 7, sequence 6 and sequence 5 potion formulations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, he suspected that his own traversal hides secrets and gives him a certain resurrection ability, which will intermittently attract people and things related to the "divination" approach. Such as the Diary of the Antignus family, such as members of the Secret Society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing this diary of Russell the Great, Klein had a new idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used the corners of his eyes to sweep through the thick gray fog and the illusory deep red star below, secretly swearing two sentences:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it not me that makes me attractive, is this fog, a mysterious space above the fog?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is also the secret that I have hidden through that thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who has no more clues and intelligence, quickly converges on his thoughts and reads the second Diary:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On January 16th, the taste of the witch is really good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;...... Klein's mouth is slightly pumped, and I don't know what face to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater, I’m too young to see you...you can’t do it... can you not care about the gender of the other person? Do not care about her experience of "happy" stage? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppressing the urge to exhale, Klein looked at the last part of his diary:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"On January 20th, I made a second card."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me think about it, let me think, I Where should I hide it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I plan to disguise it as a bookmark, in a valuable book, if the winner is not For those who have a relationship, it will be hard to imagine that the most valuable book in the high value is actually the inconspicuous bookmark!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, This idea is good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Great Emperor, why don't you make it clear? Which book is the "bookmark" specifically attached to? Before I finished reading, I was still full of joy and thought that I could follow the picture and get a "Big Card" with the mystery of the gods... Klein was disappointed to keep his eyes at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
