			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ins. Zangweier went to Beckland... I don’t know how long he will stay there... um... every once in a while to confirm Once... Klein leaned forward thoughtfully, wiped off the surface of the parchment, and wrote a new divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lalhous The current position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, the chief culprit causing the death of the captain and others, and the danger of permanently slumbering for himself is undoubtedly Insz. Will, but the madman of Llanus is also an accomplice who can hardly shirk his responsibility, and must pay the price of blood for it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After meditation seven times, Klein once again entered the dream, but the gray world was split and the picture was exactly the same as he had just seen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad, slightly turbid rivers, one after another, row upon row of houses, Ron trend-oriented, various Gothic-style buildings The crowded streets, the bustling scenes, the chimneys that are constantly squirting the "fog", the magnificent palaces, the towering, iconic Gothic clock tower...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhous is also in the "land of hope", "the capital of the capital" Beckland! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein opened his eyes, slightly confused, because he wanted to divination is the specific location of Llanus, but the result is still only a very large, fuzzy The scope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This shows that the sequence of Langus is much higher than I expected... wrong, or it may be in the process of helping the 'real creator' drop the child. Gaining great benefits, such as a little divinity, for example, the umbilical-like item that remains in the baby's belly, and the latter...the latter is mostly taken away by Ins Zangweier. ..." Klein's thoughts turned sharply, whispered, and made preliminary guesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming the vague position of the two enemies, he also considered a realistic problem, that is, he has no strength to revenge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Llanus has only sequence 7, or even sequence 8, he is not easy to deal with, and he is obviously cunning and dying. It is a normal operation than the powerful one of its own... Ins. Zangweier is even more horrible, he is the demigod of sequence 4, and has a horrible "0" seal... My crossing is still hidden. Some secrets, but obviously can't be turned into combat power. Maybe it won't be possible for a long time... Only continue to improve the sequence itself, collect powerful magical items two ways... both hands, both hands are hard...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea was churning, and Klein decided to add a divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about the language, he solemnly wrote:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I become a strong hope "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gently let go of the pen with the present round, Klein leaned back on the back of the chair and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While meditating, he entered the sleep with meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray world, he once again saw the sights he had witnessed, saw rivers, piers, chimneys, crowds, palaces, various machinery and Gothic The bell tower, saw the Beckland, the capital of the Kingdom of Lun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, as the picture changes, he sees a mountain peak that penetrates the white clouds, sees a magnificent, ancient palace, and sees the top stone. The hugely carved seat, inlaid with faint gems and gold, sees the strange erects made up of myriad mysterious symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uninterrupted, the scene shattered, and Klein slowly sat up straight and reached for the edge of the bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beckland has my hope of becoming stronger..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second scene It refers to the main peak of the Hornaces Mountains, referring to the treasures left by the Antignus family. The "Imperial Puppets", which consists of countless mysterious symbols, are passed on to me. 'It's the key to unlocking everything...'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One by one thought flashed, Klein decided not to hurry to the Hornachs Mountains, hidden inside The half-god that is dangerous to the sequence 4 may not be able to withstand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the real world, he walked slowly out of the hidden place and returned to the grave of Dunn Smith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking deeply at the photos and inscriptions on the tombstone, Klein slowly drew a blushing moon on his chest and then turned to go outside the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the former value of the night, from time to time to patrol the former night of the Raphael cemetery, he is very familiar with the law of the grave guards and the surrounding environment. Without any disturbance, it was easy to get rid of the quiet and deserted area, along the paved road, with the shadow of the trees, and went to the city of Tingen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is so peaceful, the red moon is so dreamy, Klein is alone, the thoughts are like the dislocated horses, and they spread out infinitely. Come, think about the revenge plan from time to time, and sometimes think back to the captain’s unreliable memory, recalling the hidden sadness under the humor of the old Neil...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know Klein, like a wandering soul, walked into the nearest street and turned a blind road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he completely got rid of that state and fully grasped his attention, it was already two hours later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found himself standing on Narcissus Street, opposite to his brother and sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instinctively, Klein returned here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little more gratifying to take a step forward, he suddenly paused, revealing a bitter smile, whispering himself:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I knocked on the door in the past, Melissa would probably faint on the spot... Benson should be nervous to start losing hair, and then try to calmly convince me to curl up. Nominal..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he shook his head, Klein looked at the familiar door and looked at the Iron Cross Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also good, this is also good... I will not be involved in what I will do in the future... The pension for the night squad and the police department It’s definitely enough to make them live a stable life. Even if Melissa didn’t find a job, Benson was unemployed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After silently, Klein began Feeling his own exhaustion, but as a "dead", in addition to his clothes, and the carry-on citrine pendant, Aziz copper whistle, there are no other items, including the Golden Pound, including Sule, including pennies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it right to blow the copper whistle, send a letter to Mr. Azick, let him hurry to help me?" Klein smiled bitterly. One, "Forget it, don't contact him for the time being, maybe Ins. Zangweier is still observing him in secret, waiting for the right time, then looking for him... as the 'old monster' who has lived for a thousand years and lived for thousands of years. He should be able to understand the 'death and resurrection' thing... Well, it’s not too cold tonight, just find a place to make a good sleep, go to the Bingland Bank Tingen branch tomorrow morning, take out my unregistered account. The money in it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Because there are too many recent things, he has not had time to do the follow-up experiment of "sacrifice", 300 in the anonymous account The gold pound is still intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is enough to support my expenses for a long time... I will buy a newspaper tomorrow and confirm that it is the day of the week... No new prayers came in, indicating that I have not missed the party...” Klein thought, looking for a sheltered corner, sat down, took off his jacket, covered him, and fell asleep against the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sleeping, he was suddenly woken up and saw a policeman with a short stick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The epaulette has only one "V", the lowest police officer... Klein glanced at him and confirmed his identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police officer said sullenly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't sleep here!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Streets and parks are not the place to sleep for you who are lazy, do not want to do things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “This is the provision of the Poor Law!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the coat and walked on the street again, and it was dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he lowered his head and entered the Becklandingen branch of the account, taking out 200 pounds of cash with the default "password", the rest One-third of the "deposit", he stayed in the account, prepared for accidents <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-When writing the ancient Hermes spell as a password, Klein There is no doubt that I have heard "pray for voices." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he spent a total of 38 pounds to buy two formal suits, two shirts, two trousers, two pairs of leather boots, two bow ties, four pairs Socks, two sets of double-breasted coats for winter, two solid color sweaters, two thick trousers, and a cane, a wallet, a leather hand luggage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Klein went to the hotel to take a bath and change clothes, and then, in order to avoid the acquaintances he might encounter, he took the rental carriage directly to Tingen. The steam train station and bought a newspaper on the way to confirm that today is Sunday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Tingen to Beckland, it takes only four hours to take a steam train, and the first-class seat is three-quarters of a pound, which is 15 Le, the second seat is 10 Sule, half a pound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very crowded, very poor third-class seats are quite cheap, only 5 Soules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it, bought the class at 2 pm, second class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a ticket and carrying a suitcase, Klein sat down in the waiting room and found a position, only at 9 o'clock in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very grateful that the Kingdom of Luen does not have a strict household registration system, and can use three months of running water, gas and rent bills to prove identity and purchase steam Tickets are simpler, just give money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the waiting hall, thinking of leaving the city of Tingen in the afternoon, going to the capital of Beckland, Klein’s heart suddenly was empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered the sister who lived the mother’s feelings, remembered the brother who liked to talk about ridiculous jokes, remembered that the three people were eating very well, lying in the position On the scene, no one wants to move...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the scene, Klein smiled and smiled a little because he remembered Melissa. The turtle, known as the "Doll", remembered Benson's poor hairline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly had a strong urge to look at his brother and sister again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, Klein understood why he did not pick the earlier train and bought the class at two in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put on the leather suitcase, walked out of the waiting hall, and took the rental carriage back to Daffodil Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he hid in the shadow of the opposite house, looking at his own door, and several times he wanted to pass, he could not cross the wide street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked across the room and felt that he was homeless. He also had a similar feeling when he first crossed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw the door open and saw Melissa and Benson coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wear a black skirt, a black veil, a black shirt, a black vest, black trousers, a black jacket, a black top hat, the same expression, and emotions. Very low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa is thin... How is Benson so embarrassed... Klein’s heart is sour, he opens his mouth, but he can’t call the two names again. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He unconsciously followed Benson and Melissa to the nearest municipal square, saw a tent there and saw the new circus performing. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson bought the tickets and took Melissa into it, forcing a little smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This circus is very famous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
