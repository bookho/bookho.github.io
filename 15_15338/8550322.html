			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;荷,荷,荷! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge respite and the fierce percussion first alternated, and then overlap, so that the spirit of Klein and others instantly tightened to the extreme, as if to hear something evil whisper . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the opportunity of Ayr, Dunn, and Lorotta’s attention being briefly drawn, the tuxedo clown slammed a long distance out of his pocket. Paper strips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! His right hand was impatient, and the paper was "shaken" into a long whip that burned a black flame, and the long whip was pumped to the side of his ankle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whirlwind but sharp screams, the tuxedo clown got rid of the invisible shackles and made a flip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! Pong! Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullets of Dunn, Ayr and Lorotta fell into the wooden container at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tuxedo clown no longer stays, holding the wound in his right hand and running away from the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is extremely fast, leaving only one back in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he disappeared, he held his right hand in the abdomen and slammed his left arm, and the wound on his stomach disappeared, as intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position where the left arm was picked up was bloody and fuzzy, and silver bullets were looming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn and others did not catch up, because the gasping in the innermost warehouse was so big that people were struggling and inspirational. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the innermost warehouse suddenly burst and splashed in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed, a rag-wrapped thing flew out and fell not far before Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stared at it and found that it was an arm, the bloody muscles were bitten, and the white bones were irregularly broken. Spending out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Snapped!啪<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing flies out, first the blood overflows, the pupils magnified the eyeballs, then the earlobe that is torn off alive, and then is still beating Half of the heart, the intestines filled with yellow-brown objects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for the more disgusting “giant view” at Ryle’s home, Klein would have to vomit again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His emotions are about to break, and it’s hard to stop the impulse to shoot in the dark door, then withdraw some of the previous empty shells and install new ones. Hunting bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down returned to close and calmly shot a shot inside the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his bullets are like entering the sea, without any resounding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holly! Lotus! Lotus! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge wheezing is getting tighter and tighter, and the grayish colors are filled with "open" doors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang Pong, the bullets of Al. Hasen and Borgia penetrated the gray, but still could not stop the "color" from surging, also Did not let the other side leave a wound, spilling liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein held his breath, did not blindly shoot, saw the "grey" gradually revealing a complete outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a humanoid creature more than two meters long, and the joints of the hands and feet are all unnaturally twisted in the opposite direction, as if they were broken by human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One after another Baisensen broken bones are spent under its skin, the overall gray surface is full of gullies, like human beings stripped of the "shell" brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster ran a gray, rot-like viscous liquid, and the head was relatively normal, with deep striated lines and pale skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It opens its mouth and can see an all-ceramic denture that is about to fall, a few bloody spores that have been drawn into filaments, and become broken Musculoskeletal crumbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riel Bieber... Is this TM still like a person? Klein took a breath and felt his heart pounding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard’s hunter bullet hit Ryle Bieber’s forehead and penetrated directly into the past, leaving a deep hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray liquid stayed out and fell to the ground, twitching and turning into a milky and obese aphid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the monster was not affected at all, and the action was not fast or slow, and it rushed to the nearest Borgia, the real goal. It seems to be the iron black box, the seal "2-049". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Extraordinary power is out of control..." Dunn screamed, "Luoluta, it looks like a dead spirit, you find its weakness as soon as possible. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Luo Luota did not say much, raised his hand and held his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her pupil turned gray, then colorless, like entering the spiritual world and the kingdom of the dead, looking down at the enemy from a higher level, looking for That very important "node". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw that the normal shooting was invalid, so he did not waste his bullets, raised his hand and tapped his eyebrows, and opened the vision, intending to assist the "digger" "Ms. Louluta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his sight, there is only one kind of "monster" Bieber's aura, which is pure gray, full of crazy gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, Klein didn’t see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Al-Hassen and Leonard Mitchell sang at the same time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Ah, the danger of fear, the hope of blush."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least the truth is true: this life flies."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The matter is true, the rest are lying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The flower will be alive after a long time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of letting sleep permeates, the distorted gray-white monster slowly slows down and seems unable to resist poetry Charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, it opened its mouth and made a scream that ordinary people could not hear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰, Klein’s head hurts and quits on his own The state of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt the nose flowing out of the warm liquid, and subconsciously reached out and found that the palm of his hand was bright red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayr and Leonard are both leaning back to the ground, the corners of the mouth, the nose, and the eyes are all traces of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borgia, Dunn, and Lorotta each stepped back one or two steps and turned white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster just "screams" and the six extraordinary people seem to have been unable to withstand and become vulnerable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is close to Borgia, and the twisted joints are suddenly glimpsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! Pong! Pong! Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borgia and Dunn fired two shots respectively, but they failed to cause even a little damage to the monster Bieber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
