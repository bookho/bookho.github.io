			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Klein took the hat back, the extraordinary characteristics of Bishop Miller have been condensed, only the size of the thumb, light blue, but from time to time will be blue-green Traces, rushing dark and dark "tide". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the pistol runner, Klein trembled and slammed the empty shell that was either gold or silver or brass. When it is crisp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he did not panic to take out the prepared bomber and load another extraordinary bullet into the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he put away the revolver and bent over to pick up the extraordinary character of Bishop Miller and didn't care to put it in his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After walking a few steps, Klein slammed his cane and turned to go to Crevis and others, and took out a paper man like a waving whip. Shake my wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper man was quickly ignited, fluttered and turned into a reddish floor, extinguished into dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good handsome..." Denton forgot the pain he had just slammed and looked at him intently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle Sparrow is like putting fireworks... Donna nodded in agreement with her brother’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After using the "paper man avatar" to interfere with the on-site information and residual traces, Klein looked at the direction of return, calmly and succinctly said:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he turned directly and did not move slowly and slowly. The "Sun Brooch" and the Aziz copper whistle were taken from Elland and Daniz respectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uldi and others have no nonsense, no shouting pain, and quietly followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the previous battle, they fully realized the specialness of the extraordinary, especially the sound ability of Daniz, the most striking, very obvious, left them I was so impressed that they really realized that this is not something ordinary humans can mix. The only thing they can do is to follow the arrangement and try to follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to survive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with Daniz, the battle between Klein and Bishop Miller is concentrated in the almost invisible wind blade and the truly invisible spiritual field, except that it seems to be The divine light of the gods and the terrible appearance of Bishop Miller’s out of control, the whole process was unremarkable, and did not make the onlookers feel too shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passing through the area just now, Krivis, Cecil and others suddenly took a step because they saw the ground covered with cracks, densely packed, Everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...they immediately understood one thing, that is, the battle between Gelman Sparrow and the fallen bishop was more thrilling than the performance on the other side. How many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear and security emerged at the same time, and they have stepped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty or thirty seconds later, Klein stopped on the street outside the telegraph office and said to Captain Ireland, without any expression:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to take a telegram?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he couldn’t help but remind him:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t go strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." On this strange night, Elland is equally cautious. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a few quick steps to the front of the telegraph office and raised his hand and knocked three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly dull voice echoes, someone inside asks: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cautionary Klein frowned, because he was talking about a man! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elland is also a bit strange:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to take a telegram.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Who? I remember that the previous watchman was a lady. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man inside replied gently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am, Paavo. Court, Melanie's colleague. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is right next to me, she is very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pawo. The special voice just fell, and the female voice immediately followed the opening:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am fine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to, pay attention, Paavo Court, back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends, your folklore is not not responding, don't you open the door? How did Papho Court go in? Klein resisted the urge to question.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerland took a step back and cleared his throat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to take a telegram to the storm Church headquarters. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, we can't open the door." "Pavo Coulter did not respond with emotional ups and downs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerland also felt the kind of surprise, did not dare to force, and offered an alternative: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you send me a message and give me the script from the crack? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The content is a change in Banxi, Bishop Miller and pastor Jess are killed, signed by Elland."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Melanie’s voice is getting farther and seems to have returned to the telegraph machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a while, there was a whispering voice inside. Not long after, a telegraph manuscript was extended from the gap under the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerlan stooped to pick up and held back the impulse inside through the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the telegraph manuscript, and his nose suddenly twitched, smelling a faint bloody smell from the paper! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly turned his head and looked at German Sparrow, using his eyes to indicate that there was a problem in the telegraph office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, responding to him is a deep, introverted, unwavering gaze, and a calm and indifferent discourse:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Return to the ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop this sentence, Klein turned directly and went to the end of the street, the figure gradually integrated into the thin fog in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz carrying the broken lantern immediately followed the legs without hesitation, as did Donna and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerland sank for two seconds, holding the telegraph script to catch up with the big forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sound coming out of the telegraph office, it was very quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe because the fallen Bishop Miller has been cleared, Klein On the way back, when I returned, I didn’t meet the headless man with a black cloak. The mysterious head only appeared twice, and it was solved easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long they have gone, they finally saw the dock and saw a “white agate” with a candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allowed Uldi and others to regain their strength, from quick-step to trot, all the way to the lowered ramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein carries a bloody cane and keeps it underneath until all of them board the ship, and then leap and leap to the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Elland has begun to summon the subordinates, the second deputy, the chief of the sea, the gunners and other subordinates, let them organize sailors, adjust the artillery, do well Preparation for starting at any time - although there is no small safety hazard in leaving Hong Kong at night, if things get worse, it will be the best way to avoid danger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Sparo..." Donna took her brother, Denton, and ran to Klein's side. He had a stomach and wanted to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded and pointed to the cabin:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First go back to the room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger has not been lifted!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna nodded, and with Danden, erected The index finger is on the lips:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Blanches and the Dimudo family entered the cabin, Klein walked over to Elland and took the extraordinary character of Bishop Miller. The past:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there are still 'deceased' who are alive, give them back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary characteristics of a bishop who may have sequence 6 will inevitably be traced by the storm church, and everyone on the "White Onyx" will be The object of suspicion, Klein did not want to go out to sea, was wanted by the number one force on the ocean.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no survivor of the "deterrent" in Banxi, the headquarters The support will have to wait for a while to come, leaving Klein with ample processing and departure time, then he will not be reluctant to return, will find reasons to come back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Elland caught the thumb-sized thing and glanced at it with a little doubt.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t ask what it could be used for, hehe Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry about the investigation of the Storm Church, I will hint at them, you and I are a group. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I was considered by the Storm Church to be a member of the military militia? Klein gently decapitated, not much to say.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aylan looked down at Daniz next to him and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Flames? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha. "Daniz laughed twice and learned someone." You guess. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I don't think so." "Erland tacitly responded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple confessed to the matter, Klein came to the side of the ship, looking at the Banxi port in the fog, guarding the hidden danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, and the peaks of the shore mountains once again illuminate thunderstorms.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A silvery and violent lightning plucked there and gradually subsided.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog in Banxi began to dissipate, and the red moon’s light became clearer .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End? Klein saw this scene and didn't dare to relax completely.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For more than half an hour, three men who called themselves “the punishers” came to the dock to see Captain Ireland.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German Sparo After the divination confirmed and swindled the other party, Airland let the sailor put down the ramp.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three "receipts" first signaled the surrounding crew to leave, then depressed The voice informed the captain Klein didn't close to listen, patiently waiting for things to finish.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later Elland returned the legacy of Bishop Miller to the “Persons of Punishment” and watched them leave the White Onyx and go to various places to deal with the endgame.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Huh... Elland breathed a sigh of relief, came to Klein and Daniz, relaxed and then said, "The matter is solved, no problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it really solved... Klein Horan remembered Paavo Court and Melanie behind the telegraph office, remembering the lime restaurant Boss Fox and quietly watched one of his guests.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
