			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Klein took the hat back, the extraordinary characteristics of Bishop Miller have been condensed, only the size of the thumb, light blue, but from time to time will be blue-green Traces, rushing dark and dark "tide". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the pistol runner, Klein trembled and slammed the empty shell that was either gold or silver or brass. When it is crisp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he did not panic to take out the prepared bomber and load another extraordinary bullet into the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he put away the revolver and bent over to pick up the extraordinary character of Bishop Miller and didn't care to put it in his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After walking a few steps, Klein slammed his cane and turned to go to Crevis and others, and took out a paper man like a waving whip. Shake my wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper man was quickly ignited, fluttered and turned into a reddish floor, extinguished into dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good handsome..." Denton forgot the pain he had just slammed and looked at him intently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle Sparrow is like putting fireworks... Donna nodded in agreement with her brother’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After using the "paper man avatar" to interfere with the on-site information and residual traces, Klein looked at the direction of return, calmly and succinctly said:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he turned directly and did not move slowly and slowly. The "Sun Brooch" and the Aziz copper whistle were taken from Elland and Daniz respectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uldi and others have no nonsense, no shouting pain, and quietly followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the previous battle, they fully realized the specialness of the extraordinary, especially the sound ability of Daniz, the most striking, very obvious, left them I was so impressed that they really realized that this is not something ordinary humans can mix. The only thing they can do is to follow the arrangement and try to follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to survive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with Daniz, the battle between Klein and Bishop Miller is concentrated in the almost invisible wind blade and the truly invisible spiritual field, except that it seems to be The divine light of the gods and the terrible appearance of Bishop Miller’s out of control, the whole process was unremarkable, and did not make the onlookers feel too shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passing through the area just now, Krivis, Cecil and others suddenly took a step because they saw the ground covered with cracks, densely packed, Everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...they immediately understood one thing, that is, the battle between Gelman Sparrow and the fallen bishop was more thrilling than the performance on the other side. How many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear and security emerged at the same time, and they have stepped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty or thirty seconds later, Klein stopped on the street outside the telegraph office and said to Captain Ireland, without any expression:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to take a telegram?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he couldn’t help but remind him:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t go strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." On this strange night, Elland is equally cautious. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a few quick steps to the front of the telegraph office and raised his hand and knocked three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly dull voice echoes, someone inside asks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who was wary, frowned, because he was talking about a man! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan is also a bit strange:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to take a telegram.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you? I remember that the previous watchman was a lady. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man inside replied gently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am, Paavo. Court, Melanie's colleague. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is right next to me, she is very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pawo. The special voice just fell, and the female voice immediately followed the opening:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am fine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to, pay attention, Paavo Court, back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends, your folklore is not not responding, don't you open the door? How did Papho Court go in? Klein resisted the urge to question.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerland took a step back and cleared his throat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to take a telegram to the storm Church headquarters. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, we can't open the door." "Pavo Coulter did not respond with emotional ups and downs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerland also felt the kind of surprise, did not dare to force, and offered an alternative: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you send me a message and give me the script from the crack? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The content is a change in Banxi, Bishop Miller and pastor Jess are killed, signed by Elland."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Melanie’s voice is getting farther and seems to have returned to the telegraph machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a while, there was a whispering voice inside. Not long after, a telegraph manuscript was extended from the gap under the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerlan stooped to pick up and held back the impulse inside through the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the telegraph manuscript, and his nose suddenly twitched, smelling a faint bloody smell from the paper! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly turned his head and looked at German Sparrow, using his eyes to indicate that there was a problem in the telegraph office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, responding to him is a deep, introverted, unwavering gaze, and a calm and indifferent discourse:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Return to the ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop this sentence, Klein turned directly and went to the end of the street, the figure gradually integrated into the thin fog in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz carrying the broken lantern immediately followed the legs without hesitation, as did Donna and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerland sank for two seconds, holding the telegraph script to catch up with the big forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sound coming out of the telegraph office, it was very quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe because the fallen Bishop Miller has been cleared, Klein On the way back, when I returned, I didn’t meet the headless man with a black cloak. The mysterious head only appeared twice, and it was solved easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long they have gone, they finally saw the dock and saw a “white agate” with a candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allowed Uldi and others to regain their strength, from quick-step to trot, all the way to the lowered ramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Elland has begun to summon the subordinates, the second deputy, the chief of the sea, the gunners and other subordinates, let them organize sailors, adjust the artillery, ready to sail at any time - although there is no small safety hazard at night But if things get worse, it will be the best way to avoid danger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Sparrow..." Donna took her brother, Denton, and ran to Klein's side. He had a stomach and wanted to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded and pointed to the cabin:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First go back to the room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger has not been lifted!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna nodded, and with Danden, erected The index finger is on the lips:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Blanches and the Dimudo family entered the cabin, Klein walked over to Elland and took the extraordinary character of Bishop Miller. The past:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there are still 'deceased' who are alive, give them back. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary characteristics of a bishop who may have sequence 6 will inevitably be traced by the storm church, and everyone on the "White Onyx" will be The object of suspicion, Klein did not want to go out to sea, was wanted by the number one force on the ocean.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no survivor of the "deterrent" in Banxi, the headquarters The support will have to wait for a while to come, leaving Klein with ample processing and departure time, then he will not be reluctant to return, will find reasons to come back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Elland caught the thumb-sized thing and glanced at it with a little doubt.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t ask what it could be used for, hehe Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry about the investigation of the Storm Church, I will hint at them, you and I are a group. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I was considered by the Storm Church to be a member of the military militia? Klein gently decapitated, not much to say.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aylan looked down at Daniz next to him and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Flames? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha. "Daniz laughed twice and learned someone." You guess. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I don't think so." "Erland tacitly responded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple confessed to the matter, Klein came to the side of the ship, looking at the Banxi port in the fog, guarding the hidden danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, and the peaks of the shore mountains once again illuminate thunderstorms.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A silvery and violent lightning plucked there and gradually subsided.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog in Banxi began to dissipate, and the red moon’s light became clearer .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End? Klein saw this scene and didn't dare to relax completely.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For more than half an hour, three men who called themselves “the punishers” came to the dock to see Captain Ireland.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German Sparo After the divination confirmed and swindled the other party, Airland let the sailor put down the ramp.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three "receipts" first signaled the surrounding crew to leave, then depressed The voice informed the captain Klein didn't close to listen, patiently waiting for things to finish.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later Elland returned the legacy of Bishop Miller to the “Persons of Punishment” and watched them leave the White Onyx and go to various places to deal with the endgame.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really solved? Klein Horan remembered Paavo Court and Melanie behind the telegraph office, remembered the owner of the lime restaurant, Fox, and quietly watched one of his guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerland continues: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Specifically, Ace stumbled upon the ancient The cannibalism and the tradition of live sacrifices are recovering, confirming that a small number of people in Banxi have become cultists.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He hurried back to the church and reported to Bishop Miller. Unexpectedly, the leader in front of him was the leader of the cult, the real fallen, and he was cut off on the spot by Miller's wind blade and died in the main church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miller is about to deal with the body, but it was discovered by the servants, and things got out of hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Some servants were turned into monsters, partly under the guidance of the priests, and sneaked into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miller sees that he can't hide it, he left the church, called the cultist, went to the top of the mountain altar, the weather changed, and the 'peremptive' took out three seals. After the incident, they rushed over and broke out in a fierce battle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this process, Miller was injured and fled, and the remaining cultists stayed at the altar and were finally defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The church headquarters has returned calls, and will send people to investigate the reasons for the fall of Bishop Miller. Oh, I told them that because of the serious injury of Bishop Miller, we can join hands. Kill him, yes, 'the punisher' also asked me to find a Blanche family and the Dimodo family signed a confidentiality agreement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the matter clearly After the original committee, Airland was relieved and busy handling the rest of the business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not dare to relax completely, still on the deck until the clouds in the sky burned, the sun slowly rose, illuminating the entire port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the residents here going out, bathing in the golden sunshine, laughing and going to their jobs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banxi Port has a human breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really over... Klein turned back in confusion and prepared After the ship opened, I added it. As for Daniz, although I had already yawned, I saw that Gelman Sparo did not move and did not dare to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way into the cabin, Klein met Elland, who had not slept the same night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, we are about to leave, no need to worry about anything." Elland laughed and said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as he spoke, the whistle of the "White Onyx" made a "squeaky" movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the voice, Klein quietly vomited and decided to throw all the doubts behind him, no longer wanting things in Banxi, he nodded. It is a response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aylan moved his neck and sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last night, I have A wonderful feeling is that the ancient Binxi and the modern Banxi Port overlap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein intended to cross the other side and suddenly grasped it. A word, the expression is calmly asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bingxi?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, This is the ancient name of Banxi Port. It was called Binxi Town three or four hundred years ago. Later, due to multiple factors such as pronunciation, it gradually evolved into Banxi.” Airland introduced it casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this answer, Klein’s eyes narrowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers very clearly that the evil spirits in the underground remains of Beckland have said that if you want to find one of the founders of the "redemption rose", the former "angel The king of Medici and his blood descendants can go to the town of Binxi to try their luck! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
