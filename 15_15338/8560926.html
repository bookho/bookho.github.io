			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requested help from Mr. Fool? Can it still be like this? "The Hidden" Jia De Li Ya heard a burst of stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not doubt the personality and ability of Mr. Fool, who has been punished and found that his leader, Greman Sparo, is getting more and more After she was amazing, she had no doubt about this matter. Even when Mr. Fool’s used her ancient items to pull her in here and let her avoid the chasing knowledge, she already understood that the other party was at least “hidden sage.” The existence of the "primitive moon" level is simply because of various reasons, it is impossible to directly interfere with the real world, and it is suspected that the ancient gods in the process of recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of the "Moon" made her surprised that Mr. "The Fool" would provide effective and substantial help to the members of the Talo Society, not the teaching of knowledge. Or pull it in smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This aspect shows that I can also ask for help directly from Mr. Fool in a critical moment... This is more exaggerated than any ceremony... It is vaguely revealed that the process of the recovery of Mr. Fool is faster than I thought... The "hidden" Jia Delia has flashed many thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Justice" Audrey, "Sun" Dairik and others are not surprised, they have more or less prayed for "Folly" Help, see the angel of this great existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing everyone’s eyes are on their own, “Moon” Emlin shrinks his head and raises his chin:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have paid.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is an equivalent exchange! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equivalent exchange... An immediate response to a great existence, effective feedback, is simply priceless! "The hidden person" Jia Delia can not help I refuted one sentence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason she did not directly say that she also hopes to have such an "equivalent exchange" opportunity in the future, and this often means She will have one more life than others!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Foers thinks that "Moon" deliberately emphasizes the exchange of equivalence, here to "fool" "Mr. prayed for help, they all provided corresponding rewards!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moon" is really a person who loves face, no, blood family... "Justice" Julie seriously commented on the emotional changes of the "Moon" Emlin in a short period of time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication continues to go down, this time the Tarot party is a little stepping in The end.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Silver City, "Sun" Dairik first carefully remembered it again "Mr.'s "notary public" advantages and disadvantages, and then went to the north of the Twin Towers again, ready to pick magical items.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not do this before, is just After the promotion, the state is not stable, and it is feared that contact with magical items will cause loss of control.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the round tower, Dairik Berger has gone through the process and proposed himself The demand, saw the selected item and obtained the corresponding information file.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After careful reading and observation, he quickly narrowed the scope to Choose one: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is "Caldi's Ring", the appearance is simple, the whole body is iron black, inscribed with dark and complicated patterns, belonging to Silver City long time ago The legacy of a resident, it can help the wearer to shake the target, let the other party have a certain stagnation, and also make the normal humans lose their senses for a short time, or wake up the warmth and memory hidden by the crazy monsters, let them fall into self in a short time. Confused state, no longer attack;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is "The wrath of Thor", which is derived from a city state that has become ruined. It is quite heavy, and looks like a giant hammer. The surface is blue and deep, surrounded by silver electric light. The handle is suspected to be living. The leg bones, which can make a sound of fear and confusion in the battle, just like Raytheon descending to the ground, roaring without interruption, it has a strong destructiveness every stroke, and terrible lightning is never absent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negative effect of "Caldi's Ring" is that the wearer will unwittingly produce another "self", so he must be treated regularly by a "psychologist". If there is one or two misses in the middle, the problem will become extremely serious and it will be difficult to heal again, and the struggle between the two selfs will inevitably lead to loss of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The probability of being attacked is 100%... When you see this data, Dairik is in vain, because it means that many Baiyin residents have disappeared based on this reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the former masters of "The Wrath of Thor"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which one is chosen? It is a terrible thing to produce another "self". Miss "Justice" seems to mention that this is called personality splitting... "The roar of Raytheon" not only has the ability to influence the state of the enemy, but also has a strong attack power... my "Hurricane Axe" because it is used too often, it should be destroyed earlier than expected... I can shine, don't worry too much about absolute darkness... Dairik thought for a while, pointing his finger to the blue giant Hammer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want 'the wrath of Thor"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160 Burke Lund Street, Klein just walked out of the master bedroom and saw the butler Walter waiting outside, holding a few invitations in his hand:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., there are three invitations on Monday, afternoon tea on Wednesday, literary salon on Friday, dinner on Saturday, they come from..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s expression was gently listened to, and smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Tell these friends . Inviter, I will attend the "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" Yes, sir, "Walter line for a ceremony and left the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his back disappeared into the ladder, Klein couldn’t help but sigh in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This invitation is another week, so I should invite my neighbors to a ball or dinner...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please go back and forth several times, I can Really enter their circle, they are recommended to higher level big men, enter different clubs...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, such referrals are definitely built on enough On the basis of financial resources, a person who has no use value will not be referred to...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between the upper class is really troublesome, at least one month, I can only touch the marginal figures of the Bakerland smog event... or the church is good, as long as there is enough donation enough to be pious, you will be free to enter and listen to the bishops, of course, if the review is passed... Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it goes well, maybe within a month, I will be able to master the internal The shifting rules of the defenders, after finding an opportunity to enter the door of Chanis...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein retracted his mind and told the close-fitting male servant Richardson to coat, Take the hat and cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the arrangement, he is going to the Kingdom Theatre to see the most popular drama "The Betrayer Ring". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not just for entertainment, only to understand popular drama, famous music, fashion novels, he can talk to others in various gatherings in the upper class. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A popular gentleman must be very tired in private, one minute on the stage, ten years of work... This social gathering really It’s heartbreaking... Klein’s belly, let Richardson put on his coat, then take a high-end four-wheeled carriage to the Kingdom Theatre in the West End, sit in the luxury box and admire the Ring of the Betrayer. This is a drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Unlike movies and TV shows, theatrical performances are more exaggerated and more powerful. Well, this is the performance environment decision...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The story is not bad, but why do I feel a bit familiar and will not tell me that the original author is Russell the Great...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" These people should be famous theatre actors. They have been mentioned in the newspapers. They are said to be highly sought after. They are a bit like the stars of the Earth Network era...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" As long as you attend more gatherings in the upper class, you will definitely have the chance to meet them..." Klein habitually spits on the side while watching the drama.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
