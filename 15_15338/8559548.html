			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's... Klein's eyelids reveal a near-transparent thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like the outer shell of something, sometimes retracts a little, disappears into Klein’s field of vision, and sometimes looks out like an invisible wind, showing a little profile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With it as an anchor point, and looking up, there is a dark green near-black color standing quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the color of the trees in the Black Forest... Klein sighed, completely unable to imagine what the "color" of the "thing" symbolizes, only Boldly guessing this may be related to further control over this mysterious space above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without trying to do nothing, he jumped down the ladder that seemed to lead to heaven and returned to his own palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering the existence of the "mysterious queen", Klein was slightly cleaned up and left the fog and returned to the washroom of his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handling the hand, he stepped forward to the front of the suitcase and turned the "sun brooch" out and put it on the double-breasted long dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After such a toss, the variety of magical items he can use now can return to the state of Beckland, but he has sequence 5, Already have one of the most difficult skills to deal with under the semi-god, it is already a truly extraordinary world power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Normally, I should be very excited and very happy, but I didn't, I didn't even find the mermaid at the moment... because for me, Just stepping out another step of revenge, the goal that I really want to achieve is still far away...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next, sum up the code, digest the 'Master of Secrets' potion Look for the formula and materials for the corresponding sequence 4. Well, these things have to be left after leaving this area, and then ask Mr. Azick, Will. Anthony, 'Magic Mirror' Arrods...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, relax these days and feet, the spirit will be too tight to break, it will lead to the appearance of out of control..." Klein turned and looked at the whole body in the room. Mirror, I saw my height nearly 1 meter 8, black hair brown, thin face, well-defined, wearing a white shirt, long dress, bow tie, wearing a hat, with a dark golden sunbird brooch, calm expression, eyes Dark and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quietly watching for a while, he raised his hands, took care of the buttons on both sides of the cuffs, and patted the black long dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning cut through the sky, illuminating the dark buildings stacked in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "hunter" who bears the double sword, Colin Iliad points to the opposite:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "That is the afternoon town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white hair he cares for is constantly shaking in the wild wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So fast... Dairik, who carried the "Hurricane Axe", was surprised to feel a surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately relieved, thinking that this is reasonable, because the giant Wang Ting itself is in the vicinity of the Silver City, the afternoon town is one of the nodes connecting the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the lightning that illuminates the night, he can see the appearance of the afternoon town. It is built on the foot of the mountain and is naturally divided into upper, middle and lower layers. In fact, it is not smaller than most of the ruins found in Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here, the gray stone barriers have become different houses, some are hollowed out, nearly ten meters, and some are the same as Dairik’s current residence. It is as short as it can make normal humans touch the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These buildings are compactly arranged, laid out, partially collapsed, and some are still strong, but they are all stained with signs of decay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is completely different from the description of the textbook... Dairik recalls the knowledge he has learned in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding the axe handle, the eyeballs "inside" two rounds of miniature sun Dairik walked on the side of the exploration team, followed the "chief" Colin step by step into the afternoon town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been cleaned up once in the first exploration, the streets are covered with rotten meat pieces and traces of dry pus, quietly around, no A little sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful, there are a lot of strange monsters hidden in the dark." Colin Iliad with old scars on his face is not slow, and his back is pulled. One of the double swords, the sword is silver and restrained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the door to myth? When the creator abandoned this land, even the myths were abandoned? Dairik couldn't help but imagine the experience of the afternoon town in the great change, and intuitively thought it might be different from the country of silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still has a better time to look around, look for possible clues, and suddenly hear the shouts from the other side of the teammates:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is something!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick looked sideways and saw the surface of the 10-meter-high boulder house , grew a transparent face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This face is covered with countless cracks that are coiled in a regular, central position, forming a whirlpool-like one-eyed or mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whirlwind is like a hurricane, whistling and squirting out, the light inside the morning is like a beam of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗噗噗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hit several members of the squad, but they were like hitting a thick wall, only to make a dull and dense voice, and soon disappeared In a gloomy environment. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know when, Silver City’s “chief” Colin Iliad has been kneeling for a long while, inserting the silver straight sword into the decaying gray stone ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He provided the most powerful guardian for the front line players! At the same time, the rest of the expedition team members launched a very organized attack, and the Light Storm and the Red Fireball hit the monster first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the light that Derick summoned also fell on the one-eyed vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the explosion, the boulder covered with cracks collapsed, and the transparent face screamed and evaporated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this battle is easy, Dairik is not happy at all. He has listened to Mr. "downward man" and "justice" in the Talo meeting. Miss, they discussed the case of the extraordinary people fighting, combined with the experience accumulated by the silver city and various monsters in the darkness, worried that the way to master the silver city is limited, below the demigod, lack of effective control means, just now The situation just confirms this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there are seals formed after the death of the monsters... Dairik thought silently, and immediately heard the "chief" command:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Explore and clean up different areas according to the arrangements at the time of departure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes, the chief!” Most of the members of the Discovery Team had a wealth of experience and soon completed the grouping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric, a group of three, except him, and Joshua and Heinham who went to the abandoned temple together, the former is Sequence 7 "Weapons Master" and has a magical glove that can manipulate the flames. The latter has recently become the "Dawn Knight" of Sequence 6, with a height of two meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The average height of Silver City, which is based on the “warrior”, that is, the “giant” approach, is 1 meter 8 (including children over 6 years old). Even if the extraordinary characteristics are not inherited, the normal genes that have been changed will accumulate from generation to generation. Although Dairik is not very old, it is close to 1 meter, and there is still room for growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the assigned goal, Derick, Joshua and Heinm enter the left side of the alley with a triangular battle queue, exploring each building to enter House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
