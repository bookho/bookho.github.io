			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have always tried to pray for the "fool", I hope to get rid of the psychological hints planted by Father Utlavsky, but I also It is very clear that it is quite dangerous to mourn the names of unidentified people. Not all hidden existences will first give bait and guide slowly. In this kind of thing, they often look like sharks in the ocean, smelling bloody smells. It will be madly robbed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is now...Nybius, no, what does the ancestor want to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White is quite ridiculously open:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will be very, Very, very dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the black iron-like enamel, Nibes Odra’s voice responded wildly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, this is normally the case.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But not all hidden existences are full of malice, in Him Among them, there are also types that follow the rules and love trading, for example, the seven bright lights of the spiritual world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the ancestors gave such revelation, it shows that the dangers that the 'fool' may bring are not too serious or even.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And in this process, I will always protect you from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you not want to get rid of psychological cues? Have you become a believer in the Mother Earth and turned your back on the moon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't!" Emlin hurriedly denied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He silently bites his teeth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope to have a few days Consider the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, no problem, I believe that you will make a choice that meets the noble character of the blood family." , smile and comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending Emlin White. After returning to the second floor, Kasimi Odra re-enters the dark and gloomy underground hall, full of puzzles and doubts. Asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can the grandfather, the ancestor's revelation, have Emlin White. He is just a weak blood race that has not been in adulthood for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Nibes is transmitted through the thick black iron coffin cover, with a few echoes of the eaves:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, there is never Emlin White in the revelation given by the ancestors.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He just showed the scene of the end of the day, showing The erosion from the Red Moon, and mentioned the 'fool' and the corresponding name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this process, no blood clan appears, the so-called key person, just to convince Emlin White to virtualize the content.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, the ability to take risks for the future of the blood family is also a key issue. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casimi is first and foremost, and immediately has new questions:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you? Selected Emlin White? What special place does he have? "Nbs. Odra suddenly smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp Do you want to pray to the 'fool'? I don’t think we are paying enough attention to his problems. I don’t want to be an enemy of Utravsky’s bishop. Would you like to find another help? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will satisfy his wish this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casimi is there, I can't speak for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin. White stood on the railing of the second floor, overlooking the tireless fellows, and sighed with a drink of "wine." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday morning, Jowood District, 15 Minsk Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein squatted in front of the toilet, holding a brush and carefully cleaning the dirt inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the scheduled plan, after completing all the "visits" on Saturday and Sunday, he decided to take a day off and wait until tomorrow to report to Prince Edessack. As a result, the task was handed over, but in the time of relaxation, he found that the house was too messy and dirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this situation, Klein remembered that the cleaning was done by temporarily hiring the maid of the next-door wife, twice a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the Summers traveled to Seville in Desi Bay for a holiday, the maids followed and served, one won the year-end reward and returned to the country, he No. 15 Minsk Street, where he lived, has been cleaned for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had intended to endure for two days, anyway, he was about to "leave" Beckland, but after he was idle, he did not dare to sneak into the Craig Club Entertainment. I am afraid that I will be angered by Prince Edsac. I can only stay at home, so I don’t want to be pleasing to the eye. I just put on old clothes and started to clean up the new year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeping the toilet, washing the bathtub, cleaning the window, mopping the floor, wiping the utensils, washing the laundry... Klein was busy from 8 o'clock to 11 o'clock, only barely finished. Scheduled cleanup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he just made it, not so detailed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, the house is rented too much, not a good thing... Klein washed his hands and wiped his face with a towel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the bathroom, looking at the clean and tidy living room and dining room, watching the sun shining through the clouds on the transparent glass windows, showing golden spots Block, he has some sense of accomplishment, and he feels happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reward yourself at noon, go out and find a good restaurant... Klein returns to the second floor and changes clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he flipped through the newspaper and waited for a good lunch time, the doorbell suddenly jingled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All New Year, and someone to commission the task?" Klein got up and walked to the door, making up his mind to reject the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he only has 34 pounds of cash in his body, in order to get rid of the royal family, he must go to the South as soon as possible to "vacue" and can no longer take the task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the visitor was not a stranger, but the old housekeeper of Prince Edessac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler is wearing a tailored long tuxedo, not arrogant and arrogant:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Detective Moriarty, His Royal Highness waits for you in the carriage at the street, and wants to know the progress of the investigation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So eager? Also, save tomorrow to run Red Rose Manor... Klein quickly reorganized the rhetoric of last night's idea and responded calmly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was about to take off the hat on the coat rack, a sudden pain in his stomach, and the pain of trying to rub the toilet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After forbearing and discovering that he couldn’t help it, he apologized to the old butler:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very embarrassed, I go to the bathroom first, my stomach is not very comfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler has no abnormal expression:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is your freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One wave after another but it’s still easy to solve the problem After the residue, Klein washed his hands and returned to the foyer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he found that the old butler was no longer there, waiting for the maid outside the brown-haired natural volume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than 10 minutes, I have already been as soon as possible... I usually hold a newspaper, I can take another moment... Klein smiles: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the response, the maid who completed the task immediately unloaded the baggage and chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Detective Moriarty, you missed the lady again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Klein was slightly upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid lowered the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lady had a time with the prince. It is her proposal to detour to visit you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results, I missed because of a stomachache? This is a bit wrong... Klein frowned slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A room with a thick carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pen holder held by it stopped and stopped writing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notes that are spread out below have a line of words and a lot of smeared traces:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Smudge)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The goal is to get rid of control, but unfortunately, detective Sherlock. Moriarty has left before she goes downstairs."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goal affects the maids around, but is managed by Prince Edsac Kerr discovered the problem by chance and dealt with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Smear )<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goal is once again out of the trajectory, instead of Prince Edsack attending the funeral of Tallim, however, she quickly recovered to normal and she found herself unrecognizable Who is Sherlock. Moriarty, can only be miserably missed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Sherlock. Moriarty went to the Red Rose Manor for investigation, but the timing was wrong. The goal is to go to the golf course for horse riding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Smudge)<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goal once again defeated the arrangement, and Prince Edsack went to visit Sherlock. Moriarty detective, but unfortunately, Sherlock Moridy had a stomach It hurts, staying in the bathroom for 7 minutes and 45 seconds, and the prince can't wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The five senses are like carvings, but the middle-aged man with one eye put down the feather pen and looked at the woman on the side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are on her What did you put in? Breaking through the restrictions again and again would cause a big problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman smiled aloud:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just an accident, don't worry too much, there won't be any problems. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said while pulling her hair, revealing a long, slender neck.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she Slowly smearing all kinds of things on my face, more and more people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her posture, wearing clothes and wearing accessories, The middle-aged man with dark hair is slightly frowning:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you going? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman did not answer directly, said with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
