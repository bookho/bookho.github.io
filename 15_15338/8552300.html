			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazardous, not high, nor low...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means Mrs. Shelen’s still In the house, there is no absconding...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stunned and immediately understood the reason:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He used the method of "summoning" himself into a more peculiar spirit to search the safe, search the inside of the mezzanine, did not force unlock, did not touch the hidden mechanical devices or anything else, so Mrs. Shelen Undetected secrets have been found to be normal, she will only think which thief is burglary, or which private detective is commissioned to sneak into the investigation, but has not gained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, she is not alert enough to stay at home, which is a logical and logical thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of a situation is unsettled, giving an overreaction, not like Mrs. Xuelun, who knows Klein, that is a calm Pretending to be afraid and poor socializing, it is a member of the witch sect who has been hiding for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the phone has been invented, Mrs. Shelen will definitely call a lover, spoke of the law and order in Tingen, and alludes to Mrs. Maynard. Klein delused a play and told Dunn and Cohenley about the results and speculations of his divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the most intimate inference." Dunn pressed the lower half of the silk hat, and looked at the second floor of Mrs. Xuelun. The corridor, "We don't rush into it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Cohenli holding the seal "3-0217" subconsciously asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Psychic Mirror" in his opponent is full of fear, always afraid of the unexpected situation of this seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den wears black gloves and looks at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember to round up 'Teacher's something about Terry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember." Klein meditated for a few seconds. "She seems to notice our proximity in advance, thus Respond promptly and escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still remember the question of the captain’s question afterwards, and proposed the fire coverage plan, which is the safest and safest way. But this time it’s not working, it’s impossible to use it, because Mrs. Snow’s house has many innocent servants... If you inform them in advance and let them evacuate in time, it will inevitably disturb Mrs. Shelen, and according to Leonard, Terry can be invisible, so it must be assumed that Mrs. Schlumen also has a similar extraordinary ability... Klein thinks a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den looked up at the sky and the red moon:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good, you The answer is very good, your instincts in this situation are quite sharp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can't rush to close, alarming Mrs. Shelen, I try to drag her away Into the dream, if successful, you and Cohenli will go in and succumb to her, um... you can decide whether to kill her, if you can't control it, your safety is the most important thing."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, every time a critical moment comes, your mind is always so clear! I am waiting for you! Klein praised it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two months, he has almost figured out their extraordinary abilities in their chats with Dunn, Leonard, Frye and others. The characteristics, among them, as a "nightmare", Dunn Smith can freely enter and exit the dreams of every sleeper in the whole city of Tingen at home or in the Black Thorny Security Company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specificly in what manner, involving the secrets of their respective sequences, Klein did not ask in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the situation that directly drags people into a dream, there are scope restrictions, often only appear in positive confrontation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Klein heard the captain mention that it is not necessary to face to face to try this extraordinary ability, within 100 meters, it can get a certain effect, just need Time, the process, can't be done in one step, just like when a child falls asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Cohenli also quite agrees with the captain's plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more, Dunn looked for a corner position, closed his eyes, clenched his hands, buried his head, black knee-length trench coat and The half-height silk hat seems to blend into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxury and gorgeous bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Shelen was lying in a comfortable rocking chair, naked and without a glimpse, completely exposed the white and tender figure to the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sometimes looks around her head and looks at the full-length mirror and appreciates the charm of herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it, her cheeks are pink, her eyes are like water to drip out, and her expression is blurred and strange love is pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table on her side is lined with the statue of a white bone, and the long, snake-like hair seems to be soft in the warm light and pink atmosphere. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, Mrs. Shelen’s frequency of looking at the full-length mirror is getting lower and lower, her head is a little bit, and the eyelids can’t stop falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed by, Klein suddenly thought of one The thing, that is, after the captain dragged Mrs. Shelen into the dream, how can I inform myself and Cohenri in time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he is out of the "nightmare" state, Mrs. Shelen will wake up and be alert to something happening... I don’t know if the captain can gesturing while dreaming. ? Klein looked back and forth, not calm, and he planned to discuss this with the other side and divert his attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, his spirit suddenly stunned and saw a huge red moon, and saw the captain Deng wearing a black knee-length trench coat under the moon. En. Smith, saw a dull, cowardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was soberly aware that he was dreaming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was dragged into the dream by the captain... It turns out that I can tell you this way... He wants to lick his face, but he can only keep his sleepy state, silly Silly: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten's slightly decapitated:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Xue Lun has entered the dream, you can act."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he emphasized another sentence :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, you must be careful enough, not reckless... would rather miss, and don't take risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; His voice just fell, Klein's eyes were suddenly broken, and the line of sight reflected the direction of the corner, buried his head, and clenched the double fist of Dunn Smith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Cohenli, who did not know when to stop pacing, opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and clicked on each other and entered the state of performing the task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is the first time that Cohenli has encountered a more dangerous task, he is more experienced than Klein and has participated in many formal actions. At this point, I quickly adjusted myself and became calm and keen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this also has the night's bonus to the "sleepless", which is one of the reasons why Dunn let Cohenri instead of Frye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go." As a sequence 8, Klein took the lead role and signaled his teammates to follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cohenli did not object, holding the mirror wrapped in thick black cloth, taking a light footstep and starting to follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein led him, came to the position where he had turned over the wall, his hands extended, clasped the gaps and bulges, and climbed to the wall between two or three . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the first contact, Klein’s inspiration suddenly became tight, as if the black cloth was not a mirror, but the door to a dangerous and strange world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, every magical item that needs to be sealed has a sinister side... Klein secretly sighed, watching Cohen’s hands and feet climbing Come up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the convenience of action, Cohenli placed his cane next to Dunn, and Klein did not entangle this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the garden, to the side of the house, he walked along the tap water pipe and climbed to the second floor balcony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he almost instinctively hung his feet, his body drooping, and once again took the seal "3 - 0271". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coenli slightly glanced at it, and immediately became aware of the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein himself was shocked, his back was forced, his left hand was supported, and he turned over easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened just now? Why can I do that? I feel like the instinct... Is this the ability of the 'clown'?" Just after the recollection, I feel that in practice, I have better played the characteristics of the "clown". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Cohenli climbed up as easily as he could, Klein returned him the "Psychic's Mirror" and opened the door to the unlocked balcony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cohenli carefully untied the black cloth wrapped around the seal "3 - 0271", let it face down, according to the floor tiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disregarding yourself and your teammates is one of the rules for using the "Psychic Mirror"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cloth was pulled and the revolver was pulled out. Cohenley followed Klein and walked lightly through the corridor to the door of Madame Xuelun’s bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein held the pistol to adjust the wheel, while turning on the vision, using the left palm to explore the door handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers that the previous divination results were dangerous, so he did not dare to have the slightest effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I didn’t do a quick divination on the spot was because he knew that there was such a sinister original witch statue in the room. It will be disturbed, not by the fog, and it is impossible to get a correct and clear answer, and Cohenli is next to him, so that he can't enter the mysterious space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unspeaking silently, the door behind the door is open, and the eyes of Klein and Cohen are warm with the warm gas light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, they saw Mrs. Shelen, who was in the recliner position, and saw her tempting body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Shelen did not fall asleep, reclining there, laughing at the corner of her mouth, looking at the two guests who were rushing to visit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, Cohenli turned over the palm of his hand and used the "mirror's mirror" to shine on Mrs. Shelen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is a sneak peek, and immediately blurs out: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers very clearly that on the other side of the lounge chair, there should have been a full-length mirror, but now he did not see it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the second hand beats a bit, and the “Psychic’s Mirror” has locked Mrs. Shelen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Mrs. Shelen was blurry and turned into a full-length mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cohenli saw himself in the mirror, and saw the seal "3-0271" in the mirror, and saw that it was reflecting on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Psychic's Mirror", a figure emerges instantly, and it is a faceless, cold and silent Cohenri himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Klein was tight at the same time, it seemed to be entangled by countless invisible filaments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
