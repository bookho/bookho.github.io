The cruel interrogators will burn the target body with red iron. The experience of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the beautiful lady can't be so rude." Becker suddenly stopped his right palm and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jerked and shook the orange-red flame into a red long whip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whip burns the air around, and there are barbs in the festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becker waved the flame whip and drew it on Irene, pumping her clothes to coke open, and the skin showed a dark black mark, and she got her The face is twisted and screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who sent you?" Becker asked again in a gentle tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene’s lips licked a few times and finally opened:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Becker subconsciously listened to the answer, his eyes suddenly reflected a bloody color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not good! Becker slammed back and rolled over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the position where he stood before, there was a slamming flame that made up a burning wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗噗噗! The rain-like blood and flesh spilled out and hit the wall of fire. It sounded like a ring, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some of them penetrated the flame, A sparse bloody spotted road was laid on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the road is the re-starting of Ambassador Intis, Becker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Irene’s abdomen ripped open and saw two arms wrapped in viscous liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two arms slammed into each other, and a figure was drilled from the belly of Miss Emily, who covered the bloody, viscous, creepy The liquid that drip down continuously has the size of an ordinary adult man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to imagine that Irene, as a normal woman with no abdomen in her abdomen, hides such a thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can this be hidden? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body below Irene’s head was completely blasted, turned into pure flesh and blood, poured into the humanoid, mixed with the constantly dripping liquid. A weird red robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure reveals its own appearance, the beautiful demon is like a woman's face, and the bloody robes on the "it" are shining under the fire, like A blooming flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Bishop!" As a senior intelligence officer, Becker immediately associates the corresponding sequence name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequence of the "secret people" route 6, "Rose Bishop"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone" The Rose Bishop is an expert in flesh and blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary person of this sequence can strangely hide in other people to avoid various investigations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he drills out, the host loses his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the Lord!" Irene’s only remaining head screamed and closed her eyes forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rose Bishop" extended his right hand and clicked on the chest four times, in the order of the top right and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s eyes with blood and fire immediately looked at Becker, and his right foot took a step forward, passing through the fire wall, without any burning damage. Only the dark red liquid is constantly dripping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becker once again turned back and suddenly raised the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his most capable assistant, Rosago, and several intelligence personnel have been sent Going out, but there is still no shortage of extraordinary people in the embassy. It is the military officers who are allowed by the Kingdom of Lun. It is the protective force on the bright side here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-sequence 5, one-sequence 6, three-sequence 7, and sequence 8 and sequence 9 that add up to near ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becker’s voice kept reverberating in the room, but it couldn’t be transmitted. The music outside did not change, and the dance did not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be a world of independent isolation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This..." Becker wisely stopped shouting, narrowing his eyes and examining the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Bishop of Rose" is not eager to start, smiles low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is your own will, the rules you set yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You told the guard before, don't bother, don't get close, don't let people come."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... I magnified your rules of your will, a little twisted, you want to break this interval, you must overcome yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becker’s face changed slightly. From this seemingly obeying the rules, the actual distortions, constantly drawing on the characteristics of order power to serve themselves, thought of the name of another sequence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Corrupted Baron!" Becker whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "lawyer" approach, which is the sequence of the "black emperor" approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, Becker’s face suddenly became extremely gloomy, and added a sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Shepherd! You are a shepherd!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you from Aurora? Mr. A?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you want to assassinate me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Bishop of Rose", no, "Shepherd" Hehe smiles:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to know who I am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Accept the Lord's favor..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t finish his words, his body suddenly froze, his joints seemed to be covered with rust, and the whole person had a meal and seemed to become a puppet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becker laughed, and the gloomy moment disappeared. He pulled out the white handkerchief in his left chest pocket and wiped his mouth:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very glad that you can talk to me so much and give me enough time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White handkerchief was taken After walking, he showed a thumb-sized head in his left chest pocket. This is a black puppet head with eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Shepherd" opened his mouth and wanted to speak, but only heard a hollow voice that seemed to come from a distance:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, his body swelled, his skin became dark and his head was long Two curved goats with sinuous patterns appeared, and the wings were covered with sulphur-flavored wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shepherd" approached three meters and turned into a demonized creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even then, he still seems to be stuck in every joint, the movement is stiff and slow, and his thoughts begin to blur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still have the power of the 'devil'? It is worthy of the 'shepherd', let me send you to see your Lord." Becker no longer nonsense In the right palm, a flame long gun was condensed, and the tip of the blazing flame was a long gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bent over his arm and threw a long gun, nailed the "shepherd" to the wall and burned it to ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequence of the "conspiracy home" is called "arsonist", and the ancient name is "Fire Master"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough! Cough and cough! At this moment, Becker violently coughed up, coughing as if to spit out the heart and lungs, coughing the flames, the guns lost control, the inch dissipated, and the cough His face is red and his forehead is hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of his magical items on the enemy was also lifted, and the "Shepherd" got rid of the stagnation and returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you think I have to talk to you so much? How is the feeling of severe pneumonia and unstoppable cough?" The demonic face squinted Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this sentence, Baker Lang remembered the appearance of a beautiful demon like a woman when the enemy first appeared, remorse: <br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, disease!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, cough, kill one, cough, cough, pain Witch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shepherd" lifted the demonicization, and the body became shadowed and layered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I just accepted the Dark St. "Gifts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that 'the conspirators' always have a variety of methods, so I will use my strongest ability, no Let you have any unnecessary hopes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a book in front of him, a transparent and fuzzy book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ancient book is flipping fast and accompanied by a low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I come Yes, I saw, I recorded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as I have recorded it, I can use it once. This is the ability that the Dark Saint deliberately showed me. Although it can only have half of the original effect, it is enough." The voice of "Shepherd" became ethereal, and the body was wrapped in the darkness of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly became a little giant of two meters, three or four, covered with black, cold armor, only the eye position, flashing two deep Red light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dark knight raised his straight sword in his hand and took a step forward, suddenly it was a beggar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becker’s screams, the layers of flames in his body were opened, the constant bursts of light were opened, and his body was split in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! Becker fell to the ground, and there was no blood spill in the fracture. Even his soul seemed to be eroded by the dark sword that seemed to be non-existent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! Bang! Bang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire groups that Bakerlang sprayed out of control lost control, and the room collapsed and shook the glass, and this time, because of his own will The resulting isolation has disappeared with his death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Shepherd" did not stop, nor waited for the extraordinary characteristics to be released, restored the appearance of the shadows, and seized the embassy’s military officers have not arrived. The opportunity, through the layers of the wall, ran into the darkness outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
