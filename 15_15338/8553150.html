			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really...very style! In the face of the bodyguard's answer, Klein upturned his mouth and showed a clear smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I can temporarily contend with Rosago, the "Master of Secrets", and even form a saw to some extent, she is mostly the strongest of the sequence 5, no Knowing which sequence, what is the name of the potion, the state is quite peculiar... If there is no her, I have no chance to use the word "dirty"... Klein picks up the newspaper next to it and pretends to read it. In fact, think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he quickly shifted his focus back to the question of whether there were loopholes in itself, for example, the extraordinary characteristics of the pollution left by Rosago have strong The spiritual brilliance, which is only blocked by the iron cigarette case, is likely to be obscured, and it will be directly exposed under the prying eyes of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quietly turned on the vision, looked down at the pocket, and saw the faint color in the iron cigarette case, but it was not obvious, quite Thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a mixture of his own gas field color, which is difficult to distinguish and hard to detect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, at least the high sequence of strong can be seen through the two interferences... No wonder the herbal powder and the corresponding essential oils and other materials, Metal vials, not wooden ones, must be used, because some of them contain spirituality, and if the level of vision is high, they can penetrate the board and see the color of the gas field..." Klein suddenly understood some Precautions in the field of occultism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to work according to the chapter, did not consider why, now understand the true meaning behind the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After repeated confirmation, Klein put down the newspaper and went to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally planned to take off his bath and relax completely, but he thought that there was a bodyguard who didn’t know where it would appear, and felt a little uncomfortable, just wash his face. Brush your teeth and soak your feet with hot water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the bedroom, take off his coat, hide the items, Klein fell on the bed, because it was too tired and strong for a while, his spirit It was quite tight, but it was impossible to fall asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blinking at the blushing moonlight on the ceiling, Klein did not try to immerse himself in deep meditation, but unconsciously unfolded his thoughts. It’s like riding a horse without pulling a reins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it, because there were too many coincidences in Tingen City, and afterwards I understood that this has a deep relationship with the seal "0-08". So he quickly noticed a problem:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second case after I arrived in Beckland gave me the magic formula for the next three sequences. "Is this too clever?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although this is in line with the revelation of my divination - "the hope of becoming stronger in Beckland", but also Too fast and too simple?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Simple is not about difficulty, but about the degree of trouble. This is a very difficult and dangerous thing, but it is not complicated. It seems simple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to my expectations, it should be through the "May of Justice", "Down Man", Miss Hugh and her companions The collection of information, a little bit of the tail of this ancient organization, after many twists and turns, finally got the formula, which is at least three months, who knows, this is not yet It’s been successful in three weeks...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Who will not be clearly arranged by anyone?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... It’s no accident that the secret retreat has something to do with the Republic of Intis, and the side of Russell’s diary confirms this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ability of 'Divination' and 'No Face' is very suitable for intelligence organizations. It is reasonable and normal for the serializers of similar channels to become the assistants of Bakerlang. There is a coincidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ambassador sent someone to retaliate against me, there should be an idea of ​​diverting sight, that Rosago, who is the easiest to succeed and the easiest to escape, is The choice to effectively reduce risk is not surprising."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As I have summarized before, the problem is that Mersor is too embarrassed. I am worried that everyday disguise is not easy to attract people's attention. It is not easy to cover up the face. Although these two points are affected, especially the former. , but in accordance with the corresponding personality, mentality and origins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, this is not the point, this does not explain the second case I encountered involved" The problem of the sequencer in the divination's route."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fighting is doomed? It feels wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Let's think about it again. After I crossed it, the first second case involved was also related to the 'divination' approach. Of course, this can be explained by the arrangement of '0-08'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, the notes of the Antigonus family also polluted the 'good luck puppet', the complex vertical that involved the treasures of the Antignus family. The eye symbol shows me that the reason I thought at the time was that after the extinction of the blood of the Antigonus family, it would become a 'divinationist’ And I have been exposed to it as a living object."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now think about it, this reason is very playful, in case I am a devout goddess of darkness Believers? But at the time I just made a guess and didn't make a decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The treasures of the Antigonus family obviously involve the divination 'Pathway.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Think more, why do I cross over, why am I just attached to Klein, not someone else... ... At that time, Klein happened to be black divination, controlled by the Antignus family's notes, and the note was clearly related to the 'divination' route."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, the first Russell Diary I saw had regretted not selecting apprentices, thieves and diviners. It was a coincidence."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the beginning to the end, except for the part involving 0-08, those things are very messy, not like conscious Arrangement, closer to one, a passive attraction, mutual attraction, and intermittent attraction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am attracted to the 'divination' approach What are the related things and things that are attracted to them at the same time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking very strange, this attraction can even affect the fate indirectly, let Mr. Azke Can't see it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What strange features do I have? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This feature allows me to die and resurrect?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein has the urge to confirm the divination on the fog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he quickly denied the idea, not only because the bodyguard may be looking in the mirror, but also because he thinks his greatest feature is to have the mysterious space above the fog!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, using it to divince itself, obviously there is no way to have an answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least for now, there are no obvious traces of manipulation, pure If you just attract it, you can accept it... and I have chosen an extraordinary way. I can't change it before the sequence 4. Let's take a step and take a step... Well, first of all, don't go to the Hornaces to find Antioch. The treasure of the Genus family... Oh, I have a hunch, I will say the true fragrance in the future... Klein silently laughed at himself, feeling that the tiredness of the slowing gradually rushed, so that his eyelids could not stop closing.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thought before he fell asleep was:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To participate in various extraordinary gatherings, and to collect the extraordinary materials corresponding to the "magician" through Miss "Justice", "Down Hang" and "Sun" students, and there is no "faceless person". Refused, in addition, try to get a magical item with no negative effects. Before the digestion is completed and the strength is improved, the power of self-protection is more... In addition, invest, trust, save money, and find Languwu. Sri Lanka, the beginning of revenge with him, can be regarded as practicing hands...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the intention of Klein.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 7 o'clock in the morning, he naturally wakes up, and the outside is still cloudy and foggy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
