			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Happiness” is the sequence of the witch route. When Klein Principal’s wife obtained its complete formula, it is difficult to recall the specific Content must rely on dream divination to help reproduce, but if you really want to hear the main materials covered, you will still feel familiar and will produce associations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but look at the buyer’s side and confirm that the other person’s face is from the skin color, body, voice and face that is not covered. Male. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frontier of "Happy Witch" is "Witch". No matter what gender is originally, as long as it passes, it will be unified as a woman. No... He hasn’t become a “witch”, what is the main material for “Happy Witch”? Um... Is he helping people buy? Is he a partner of a "witch" or a loyal subordinate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as a relatively old and inherited secret organization, the witch sect should not be too lacking in the corresponding materials, with their nature, with the legacy of the former members. Extraordinary features to modulate the potion are normal operations... The "witch" behind the purchaser and the organization are lost? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of thoughts, and Klein has the urge to follow each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after careful consideration, he rationally gave up this plan, not to mention whether he can bypass the "eye of wisdom" precautions, lock the other side's trace, light It is the opposite situation, the time to do divination and other factors, it is enough to let him choose to follow the will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case there is more than one "witch" over there, there are other more powerful extraordinary people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, it is a good thing for the "witches" to be promoted to "happy witches". The former will spread disasters and endanger many innocents, but once they become the latter, the goal is "Happiness" is on, in simple terms, the social harm is small... Klein sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silk gland of the adult widow spider has become a more valuable, less common material, like the Kane’s promotion sequence 6 The pituitary and the human skin have the same characteristics, almost equal to half of the house in the capital's quite good location, so the buyer did not get a satisfactory answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurately, no one gave him a reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of the party became silent until the pharmacy of the chubby pharmacist sold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After previous attempts, he had a lot of repeat customers. In less than three minutes, he sold all the items he could sell and gained more than 50 pounds of cash. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "Eye of Wisdom", the old man announced the end of the party, each participant left in different channels in different orders and at different intervals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is in the middle, and after going to other secluded streets to disguise himself, he immediately rushed to the east and arrived at Black Palm in the cold and mixed smelly nights. Street, entered the one-bedroom house rented, and bought a gun bag on the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a break, he took out a revolver, opened an iron box with extraordinary bullets, and took out two "purifying bullets", two "hunting bullets" And an "exorcism bullet", stuffed them into the hole one by one, and placed the shot at the empty magazine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put down the posture, tried the test and can fire normally, Klein put the revolver into the armpit of the armpit, busy to do other preparations: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, check if there is any abnormality in the "black eyes" in the iron cigarette case, for example, put the Azick copper whistle into the tin box for the bullets. With the help of the Holy Night Powder, a closed spiritual wall clinging to the surface was created, and the shield of the ancient delicate copper whistle was completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming the shape and position of each of the three spells, Klein went to the fog to do divination, then put on the cap and go out again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His goal is 32, Wilti Street, South Bridge, the place where the thief found the "master key"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be clues about apprenticeship follow-up recipes or related items. Klein had long wanted to explore, but he suspected that the tragic guy had become a resentful creature. I have to wait until I buy a "purified bullet" to dare to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the steam subway stopped operating, Klein arrived in the southern part of the bridge in this most cost-effective way, and transferred to the public carriage to the vicinity of Wilti Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the night is deep, Beckland is carrying a drizzle of chills, there are almost no pedestrians on the street, and the light of the gas streetlight is covered by the glass surface. The contaminated liquid makes you look like you are in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein circled around and observed the condition of the house on the 32nd, came to its side and climbed to the second floor, from the previous thief The balcony door that was opened but obviously could not be closed again, easily entered the target interior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- He did not bring the "master key", fearing that the item would cause an abnormal chain reaction here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout of this house is the same as normal. A corridor connecting the balconies on both sides runs through the second floor. It has bedrooms and washrooms on both sides. Sun room, living room and other rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the blushing moonlight coming in from the balcony, Klein saw that all the doors here were opened, and the various items inside were thrown into the ground, messy. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should have been done by the thief, he couldn’t take all the items, he could only find the most valuable ones...but he took the “master key” Not to open the door... Klein checks the past one by one and looks for things that may involve mysterious realms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, he wore black gloves and he came to the stairs without any gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just walked two steps down and suddenly reflected a figure in his eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure clung to the wall at the corner of the stairs, facing Klein, with dark hair behind his head, almost covering his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who had already opened the vision, had not had time to observe it, and the figure suddenly moved! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s neck creaked, his head turned like that, and his body still turned his back to the second floor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;朦胧, faint, illusory blush in the thin light, the figure's eyes are completely convex, full of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪,啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two eyes fell on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure’s head got out of the neck and squatted on the wooden stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already dead, there’s no spiritual light... Klein looks calmly, judging, just like what happened just a farce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a guess from the old black clothes of the other party and the many rooms open on the second floor, thinking that this is another thief, after the previous thief, patronize The thief of this house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unfortunately, he is not so lucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you say that the "master key" actually binds the "danger" here, and when it is taken away, everything breaks out? Klein pulled out the revolver, adjusted the firing position and the trigger, along the stairs, step by step to the side of the dead body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squatted, checked slightly, and failed to find other causes of death other than the neck being broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, Klein stood up straight and cautiously descended, even if the soles of the feet were wooden steps, he did not step on the sound of groaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, second, third, he walked the stairs and stepped on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of his eyes is a corridor connecting the two sides, where the blushing moon shines in, faintly outlines the balcony, and the sides of the corridor, one The fan door opens wide, revealing the messy scene of the scattered objects. There is no living room, no restaurant, no kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second floor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
