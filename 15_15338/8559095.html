			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving the "Sweet Lemon" bar, Klein returned directly to the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he packed his bags, the huge white bone messenger suddenly appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It originally wanted to pat the shoulders of Klein, but because of the height of nearly four meters, the head passed through the ceiling and failed, only the letterhead was forwarded Throw, the active disintegration disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Azick finally replied, it’s almost a week... Is this messenger changed? Much like the original one, I will make a corresponding reminder... Klein caught the letter and showed it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I don’t reply until today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe because the memory of recovery exceeds the limit that the body can withstand, I have been sleeping for several days to adapt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The things you describe are indeed in line with the characteristics of the 'stealers' approach, and their corresponding sequence 4 is called 'parasitics', from this up, all Have the extraordinary ability to parasitize others.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I know, 'parasitic' has two forms:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A kind of preliminary, 'parasitic' hides itself with the 'host', prolongs life, restores the wound, he can see everything the 'host' sees, hears all the sounds heard by the 'host' But can't interfere with the 'host' thinking and steal his ideas, so the 'host' wants to communicate with the 'parasitic' and must actively voice;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The other is comprehensive control. The 'parasitic' and the 'host' spirit are almost integrated, knowing his ideas, understanding his intentions, and actively taking over the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the face of the first 'parasitic', you can remind the 'host' by dreaming, subconscious dialogue, etc., without worrying about being discovered, because 'parasitics' must With the sense of the 'host', you can detect the things around you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the second state, there is no bypass of the 'parasitic' and 'host' dialogue The solution, but there is also the opportunity to clear, that is, relying on the object of the 'host' belief, it is difficult for me to accurately describe this kind of thing to you, can only tell you that when the mind prays, the object of faith can find the 'parasitic person' The existence and feedback with certain ceremonies to complete the separation or removal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the premise is that the 'host' itself is not clear about what will happen, otherwise the 'parasitic' will be alert and prevent..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter situation is not what happened to the small "sun"? He prayed to me ignorantly, and I saw the existence of Amon's avatar, then concealed the purpose, taught him the ritual, and purified the "parasitic"... Klein had a deeper understanding of the previous thing. Level of understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, I can't confirm the state of the poet at the moment. In Tingen, he occasionally talks to himself, this is perhaps the first. The performance of the ecology, but the problem is that it has been several months, and the 'parasitic' may have completed comprehensive control.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confirm this thing first, in order to know what to do, otherwise blind dreams will only lead to the purpose of being noticed by the 'parasitics' in advance, making the problem more serious and more difficult to solve...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is the second kind of ecology, the poet believes in the goddess, but the goddess has tens of millions of believers, and it is unlikely to focus on the red gloves of a non-sacred non-sacred person...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s different from my 'fool', there are always prayers to see, often one-on-one service. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the state of the 'starting period'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it Suddenly a little embarrassed and lamented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intended to entrust "Moon" Emlin to secretly monitor Leonard Mitchell and find out if the other person would often whisper to himself, considering " The kind of "fire" gloves have made Emlin appear in Leonard, appearing in the eyes of the "parasitic", and the high probability has become the object of their alert and investigation, and they have to give up the idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. 'Magician' is only a sequence of 8, is a 'master of tricks', not yet in an angel-level 'parasitic' and a red glove around The ability to monitor...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The identity of Miss 'Justice' is a good cover, and she is also a believer of the goddess. The problem is that she is now back in the family territory and will return to Beckland in June...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. 'Inverted Man' and 'Hidden' are at sea, and the little 'Sun' can't even connect with the outside world...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The members of the Tarot Club are still not enough. The forces that are developing downwards are not enough. I can't find a suitable candidate to help me with this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the people I know, Miss Sharon should be the best at the most intimate, but I can't contact her now, even through Miss 'Magician' and Emlin... Hey, before fleeing Beckland was too hasty, many things didn't take into account the follow-up..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein raised his hand and licked his forehead, thinking of Leonard It is the elite "red glove" in the night, with the senior deacon and the church watching, the "parasitic" is not in a short time. When I made something, I decided to temporarily suppress the problem and wait until I have the right helper.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe wait for me to digest the potion and go to the Sunia Sea I found the mermaid in the east, completed the promotion, and returned to Bakerland to do it myself... The rich Klein no longer hesitated and quickly made a decision.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sweet Lemon" in the bar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uneasy Bilt After dealing with the two celestial devotees in the confession, I finally got a good news.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that Admiral Amyrius will return to Baia today today. M? He took the cigar and got up and asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His deputy Sotos nodded lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;" Just half an hour ago, his fleet left the port and sailed to the Rothde Islands. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call..." Bilt sighed without concealing, confirming that General did not blame himself.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the replacement of Gilman Sparo in less than four days, the "make" the members of the General Guards suffered heavy losses, "Make" the superiors of your brother was dismissed from the Governor's position, the secretary suffered damage The mistress’s tragic villa, he couldn’t help but deny himself and doubt his ability to do things.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the responsibility for those things may not all be in the German Sparrow On the body, but concentrated together, it still makes people think that this is the problem of crazy adventurers, at least he is unlucky enough, and as his recommender hirer, Bilt believes that he can't evade himself, and will inevitably bear from Amyrius. The punishment will be.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The general is not a demigod, not blinded by anger, praise the Lord, may the storm be with us. "Bilter holds the right boxing left chest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, one of his men sent out hastily rushed back.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, Gelman Sparo is gone! "The man rushed to report in a hurry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill's brows slightly wrinkled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Missed? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! After he checked out, carrying a suitcase, a few laps on the street, and then disappeared! "The man said truthfully.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really difficult to monitor an adventurer who can become anyone...Bilter sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to look for him again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who was targeted by the "Desire Mother Tree", changed his mind carefully, changed his identity, changed his residence, and prevented anyone from being targeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the gain of playing Admiral Amyrius, he decided to digest the potion as soon as possible through practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheeling to the Olavy Medical Ambulance Foundation, Klein once again entered here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
