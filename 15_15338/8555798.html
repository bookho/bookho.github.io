			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Creator? Klein stunned and immediately thought of the information given by Old Kohler:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a recent belief in the original creator in the Eastern District, the Docklands and the Factory District, He does not really die, exists in every human being, exists in everything, as long as he serves Him wholeheartedly, praises Him, not only can he be redeemed after death, enters His kingdom, and his current life can be greatly improved. For example, every day there is meat that eats oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very close to the Aurora's variant creator theory, so Kline was judged to be the secret organization at the time, feeling that after the Lanerus incident, Start to pay attention to the vast majority of the poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have developed so arrogantly, and they are pulling people on the road? Klein replied with discretion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old middle-aged clothing The man suddenly smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know what the end of the day is about to come? Do you know that the original Creator would establish a sanctuary on the ground and shelter the believers?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, Klein wanted to be taught by the trend, slowly into the peripheral organization of the Aurora, collecting evidence and clues, and retaliating against the other party’s search for "fool" believers. After the move, but after careful consideration, he felt that this was too dangerous. It was not too productive and troublesome to be alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he decided to report the current phenomenon to the "mechanical heart" and let the official organization handle it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I figured out this problem, Klein instantly sinks his expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, too I don't want to know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped forward and opened the other side, ignoring the cry of the middle-aged man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to the Eastern District, he carefully observed that many workers who were unemployed due to improvements in the textile machine and entering the off-season were gathered in groups and listened. The comfort and guidance of unidentified people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigation of the Eastern District, the Docklands and the Factory District was completed in the first two months. How did the three churches and the Houses have no specific measures? Their attention to this side must be improved, and they will not be able to find out the current situation... Want to put a long line to catch big fish? This, it is easy to play off! Klein, while licking his belly, pressed the cap on his head and walked out of the East and went straight to the Beckland Bridge area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Brave" bar at noon has just opened, there is almost no alcoholic, only busy workers in the vicinity will enter here, for a simple lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was among them, spending 10 pence to order a pork sausage with oatmeal and a cup of Nanwell beer, which was very rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly filling his stomach and drinking beer, he only looked at the bartender:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cass Is Pas Kanlining there?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He plans to add some ordinary ammunition by the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender gave him a glance:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to haven’t been here for a long time?<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Casper is dead. It is said that he was restless when he slept at night. He was wrapped too tightly and killed himself. Oh, I don't believe it would be there. Things happened, I only heard similar situations in ghost stories, but those black and white dogs said so. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black and white dogs refer to police officers wearing black and white uniforms.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be killed by their own quilts This sounds esoteric... Is the high-ranking strongman of the Rose School who has always found Miss Sharon and Maric, and chose to kill and vent their anger? The high-sequence strong person's personality? Look at it, Casper I can't contact Miss Sharon anymore... maybe they have left Beckland...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspars’s danger to the extraordinary world is not enough Ah, it’s me, I won’t return to the “Brave” bar, I will bring the accumulated money, change the city to change the environment... But under normal circumstances, the high sequence strong will not deal with this ordinary People, when they are forced to "psychic", do not consider whether there are sequelae... It is the rose school that indulgences desire, and the high sequence strong can actually do this kind of thing...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was surprised and sympathetic to the black market weapon trader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender wiped the cup and continued:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to buy something, now There are new businessmen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Klein asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"‘Old man’ is in the billiard room on the 3rd.” The bartender did not raise his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately got up, slowly slammed into the familiar place and knocked on the hidden door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Come in." A voice came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice is a bit familiar... Kline pushes open the wooden door and looks inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing at the table is a boy who is not too old, wearing an old coat, a brown dome hat, and a pair of bright red Eyes, it was Ian that Klein knew when he first arrived at Beckland, and he was involved in the third-generation difference machine manuscript for the disappearance of the Zerre detective, and he had to pay a big price for the Aurora. Mr. A killed the ambassador of the Kingdom of Lun in the Lun Kingdom, Becker Jean Jean Madan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is you, Moriarty detective?" Ian was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has deliberately posted two beards to make himself look old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled into the billiard room and closed the doorway:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long time no see. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that Ian appeared here and became a black market weapon merchant, he was quite surprised at first, but immediately thought of some details, I think this is Reason: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein can find the "Brave" bar and Casper. Kanlining, it is from Ian's introduction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big boy must have a certain network in the vicinity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Ian converges on the horrified expression and mutters, "I went to Port Pritz for two months and found the guys savage." It was fierce, and there was no humility and love for the children. I had to go back to Bakerland and re-do what I was good at. Then I met Kaspers and decided to change careers."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for Klein to open, he added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Detective, I keep in mind, I still owe you two requests "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to explain so much, I don't care what you did in the past, although I always feel that you have escaped from the military situation. This is a bit suspicious. But it's not too concerned... Klein picked up a club and gestured: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to doing underground weapons trading, you still seem to be selling Intelligence?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes.” Ian replied very calmly, “What do you want to know? Free.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s so cool...because what happened to me? Kline launched the club and hit the cue ball, letting a red ball fall into the middle pocket accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not polite, straight up the body:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recently looking for 'fool' believers There are a lot of rewards. What news do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian thought carefully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I even suspected that the 'fool' had any believers, and no one could find a clue. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......This is the so-called cannon to fight the air... Klein silently laughed and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, there is a reward. Someone is looking for a university tutor called Azike Ai Gesi. I want to know who released this reward, so please confirm whether or not to mix this thing, oh, look for People are very wasteful of time. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian didn't answer it directly. He looked around and pressed down the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Military Intelligence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Military Intelligence? It’s not a spiritual group... It seems that it is the arrangement of Ings Zangweier that caused Mr. Azick to have a conflict with the military affairs. Maybe let him know a secret that should not be known? Klein flashed a series of thoughts in an instant, and finally smiled and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that I don't have to worry about the reward being fake, but I am afraid of that. Zick Eggs was tracked by the military intelligence because he had mastered the secrets. As a result, perhaps the day of the reward was the last time of my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ian spread his hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not clear to me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You can just provide clues. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good advice. Klein didn't ask more, spent 5 Sule, added some ordinary bullets, and immediately left the "Brave" bar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the rental carriage, Looking at the gloomy weather outside the window, he suddenly had some embarrassment: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caspars Kanlining died, which means Miss Sharon and Maric Will give up this 'spot'. I can only find them unilaterally. It’s hard to find them again...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless they need help, they have to deal with the evil spirits in the underground ruins. Stage, otherwise, I should not see them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I am not a friend, I have cooperated twice. I can be an extraordinary person. There is no need to cover up the acquaintances of the face, so that there are fewer than two similar people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you haven’t just experienced the 'Apostles of Desires' event, you will only be left with Emlin White. This wonderful vampire can disguise the mysterious field. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately, okay..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, Klein An illusory whistling sound suddenly sounded in the ear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you have? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stood up in a cold, waiting to see who was sitting in front of him, only relieved, but helplessly laughed:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Sharon, do you always appear unconsciously? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon wearing a gothic court dress and wearing a black bonnet is sitting quietly on the other side of the carriage, his face pale as always." .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will knock on the window next time. "Sharon nodded without emotion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't repeat the previous question, she looked at Klein so quietly and introvertedly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s also scary to knock on the window? It’s also scary... Kline is not in a hurry to mention the “human shadow” and instead asks:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The high-ranking strongman is gone? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "Sharon spits out a word.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein breathed a sigh of relief and reminded me:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It could also be a trap. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he remembered something and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I finished watching "The Book of Secrets", and got the corresponding news from other channels, praying for the 'primitive moon' is very easy to go wrong, it is best not to try. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. "Sharon didn't ask why.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused for a second, and said in a voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 'primitive moon' and the 'bounded god' are suspected to be enemies. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
