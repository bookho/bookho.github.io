			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall where the stone column was broken, there was a group of night-timers wearing black trench coats and silk hats around the altar of the wreckage. The headed person was the goddess of the night. Church of the Archbishop of Beckland, Anthony Stevenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it broken?" He whispered, not staying again, coming directly to the stone door leading to the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich darkness emerged, the stone door was silent and open, and St. Anthony led some of the nights into the inside and went deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, they did not find a guard and anything of value, it seems to be cleaned up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, they arrived at the deepest room, but there was nothing but walls and pillars. The blue door that Klein came out had long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lanterns in the hands of several nights suddenly lost their light, and the night shrouded the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything is back to normal, they find that the walls around them don’t know when they have melted, but there are no hidden doors and tunnels, or thick soil. Stones are either corridors when they come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Anthony was silent for more than a dozen seconds to speak:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try divination.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Search nearby. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walks through the cliffs and woods without roads, and sadly finds that he seems to be really sick.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary effect of Mr. A’s extraordinary ability Adding to the wet state of winter, he made a shameful cold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he did not dare to stop to collect dead branches, ignite the fire, and bake clothes. , dry the banknotes, because he is afraid to be found by the extraordinary people of the church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even if he has already endorsed by Stanton Essinger at the "Mechanical Heart" He obtained a semi-official identity, but the "original witch" awakened, "real creator" came to two highest-level cases, he will inevitably accept a rigorous investigation, for example, taking turns to "mechanical heart", the penalty Taste the black tea in the night, and repeat the whole process actively or passively.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two hidden dangers, one is There are acquaintances inside the night, although the detective of Sherlock Moriatti and the deceased Klein Moretti have a big difference, they can hardly be distinguished by photos, but he still has no confidence in face-to-face. Second, because of the similar approach, the Goddess of the Night God is not very friendly to people and things related to death. Up to the pale age at the end of the Quaternary, the god of death was fallen under the siege of the Seven Gods, and Sherlock Morrie. The helper of the caller of "The summoning" at the critical moment of the detective is a powerful descendant of death, which is a problem that cannot be washed away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person just now The very high power may be rushing to deal with Ins. Zangweier and '0-08', I have no time to pay attention to this kind of friendly little character, but I can't care about it, the run still has to run! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I have the opportunity to write to the "Mechanical Heart" to explain the second reason why I have to leave Beckland temporarily, so that In the future, there may be opportunities for cooperation. Of course, we must first secretly observe whether the "heart of the machine" has a strong hostility towards the descendants of the dead... I don't know what Mr. Azke is doing now...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, maybe in the official announcement, Sherlock Moriotti died in the meteorites, it is not disappointing this identity, this name..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein endured a fever and cold alternating state, want to find a town as soon as possible, enter the crowd.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only at In human society, the ability of "faceless people" can be brought to the extreme.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman who cooperated with Mr. A, should be a witch, went to the Eastern District... From the circumstance, there may be a large-scale death there, I don’t know... Klein’s heart with divination’s spiritual intuition It’s heavy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, all the colors in front of his eyes become rich, like the oil splashed by the gods.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It felt like a flash, Klein found himself away from where he was, saw the color of the bronze, and the soft Azick Aegis appeared next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Azick, are you not hurt?" He was relieved to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Azke answered calmly and smiled. "But for the 'undead,' this is not a big problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein calmed down and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ince Zangwell and '0—08'?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Ins. Zangweier is still alive, still holding the '0’ seal.” Az Ke said as he walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein struggled to keep up and couldn’t help but sigh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a pity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't care, he suffered a minor injury." Azk solemnly said, "More importantly, we know that he is in the royal family." Do secret cooperation, don't worry if you can't find him later, so you can concentrate on improving yourself, and I can try to go back to several places that have already been recalled, and wake up more memories. Oh, you are lucky. I have been secretly observing the military intelligence and the royal family. I want to determine the whereabouts of Ins. Zangweier. Here, the red rose manor is a key point, so I always linger around there, otherwise it is not so Come and save you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Klein was a bit embarrassed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Azick, don't you wonder why I didn't die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also often enter the coffin and wake up, this is I thought about it before." Azke smiled carelessly. "In my broken memory, similar things are rare in others, but there is no precedent."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; often into the coffin and wake up... often? Klein suddenly found out that his concerns were not in the real eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the “undead” of the “Death” route... Mr. Azick said before that he had stayed in this sequence for a long time, the meaning of the words That is, he has been promoted for a long time... Klein thought about it and asked with some anxiety:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Azick, Insz. Will you find that I am Klein Moretti?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is afraid of revenge on Benson and Melissa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He shouldn't have, at most I think we've known it for a long time, or you are simply mine, mine, the police say, my informant." Azick recalled the next way, "but that '0' seal may be noticed, but you don't have to worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Klein Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick didn’t know what to remember, his face suddenly became a bit weird, and he seemed to want to laugh and feel horrified:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The '0' seal will always try to write to his master, this should be its essence, will not change, so this key moment can make Ince Zangwei I don’t think it will take the initiative to disclose the information, unless it involves a place that cannot be explained.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Mr. Azick It was so convincing and well-founded that Klein breathed a sigh of relief and the cold seemed to be a little better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick sees it and adds one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are best to stay away from Baekeland in the near future De, Ings Zangweier may retaliate against you with the '0' seal, relying on your pseudonym.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as not in Beckland There is no problem, the '0' seal will not affect more than a metropolis. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have guessed, there is scope limitation... otherwise Ins Zangweier can completely hide in a small town in the South Chinaland and arrange leisurely The fate of all goals, do not have to worry about being found... Klein asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take a short time back to Bakerland for a day, or for a long time, no problem Right? Under the premise of changing identity and appearance. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
