			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall where the stone column was broken, there was a group of night-timers wearing black trench coats and silk hats around the altar of the wreckage. The headed person was the goddess of the night. Church of the Archbishop of Beckland, Anthony Stevenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it broken?" He whispered, not staying again, coming directly to the stone door leading to the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich darkness emerged, the stone door was silent and open, and St. Anthony led some of the nights into the inside and went deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, they did not find a guard and anything of value, it seems to be cleaned up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, they arrived at the deepest room, but there was nothing but walls and pillars. The blue door that Klein came out had long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lanterns in the hands of several nights suddenly lost their light, and the night shrouded the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything is back to normal, they find that the walls around them don’t know when they have melted, but there are no hidden doors and tunnels, or thick soil. Stones are either corridors when they come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Anthony was silent for more than a dozen seconds to speak:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try divination.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Search nearby. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walks through the cliffs and woods without roads, and sadly finds that he seems to be really sick.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary effect of Mr. A’s extraordinary ability Adding to the wet state of winter, he made a shameful cold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he did not dare to stop to collect dead branches, ignite the fire, and bake clothes. , dry the banknotes, because he is afraid to be found by the extraordinary people of the church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even if he has already endorsed by Stanton Essinger at the "Mechanical Heart" He obtained a semi-official identity, but the "original witch" awakened, "real creator" came to two highest-level cases, he will inevitably accept a rigorous investigation, for example, taking turns to "mechanical heart", the penalty Taste the black tea in the night, and repeat the whole process actively or passively.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two hidden dangers, one is There are acquaintances inside the night, although the detective of Sherlock Moriatti and the deceased Klein Moretti have a big difference, they can hardly be distinguished by photos, but he still has no confidence in face-to-face. Second, because of the similar approach, the Goddess of the Night God is not very friendly to people and things related to death. Up to the pale age at the end of the Quaternary, the god of death was fallen under the siege of the Seven Gods, and Sherlock Morrie. The helper of the caller of "The summoning" at the critical moment of the detective is a powerful descendant of death, which is a problem that cannot be washed away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person just now The very high power may be rushing to deal with Ins. Zangweier and '0-08', I have no time to pay attention to this kind of friendly little character, but I can't care about it, the run still has to run! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I have the opportunity to write to the "Mechanical Heart" to explain the second reason why I have to leave Beckland temporarily, so that In the future, there may be opportunities for cooperation. Of course, we must first secretly observe whether the "heart of the machine" has a strong hostility towards the descendants of the dead... I don't know what Mr. Azke is doing now...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, maybe in the official announcement, Sherlock Moriotti died in the meteorites, it is not disappointing this identity, this name..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein endured a fever and cold alternating state, want to find a town as soon as possible, enter the crowd.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only at In human society, the ability of "faceless people" can be brought to the extreme.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman who cooperated with Mr. A, should be a witch, went to the Eastern District... From the circumstance, there may be a large-scale death there, I don’t know... Klein’s heart with divination’s spiritual intuition . & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp heavy <br <br /> & nbsp />;It felt like a flash, Klein found himself away from where he was, saw the color of the bronze, and the soft Azick Aegis appeared next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Azick, are you not hurt?" He was relieved to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Azke answered calmly and smiled. "But for the 'undead,' this is not a big problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein calmed down and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ince Zangwell and '0—08'?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Ins. Zangweier is still alive, still holding the '0’ seal.” Az Ke said as he walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein struggled to keep up and couldn’t help but sigh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a pity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't care, he suffered a minor injury." Azk solemnly said, "More importantly, we know that he is in the royal family." Do secret cooperation, don't worry if you can't find him later, so you can concentrate on improving yourself, and I can try to go back to several places that have already been recalled, and wake up more memories. Oh, you are lucky. I have been secretly observing the military intelligence and the royal family. I want to determine the whereabouts of Ins. Zangweier. Here, the red rose manor is a key point, so I always linger around there, otherwise it is not so Come and save you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Klein was a bit embarrassed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Azick, don't you wonder why I didn't die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also often enter the coffin and wake up, this is I thought about it before." Azke smiled carelessly. "In my broken memory, similar things are rare in others, but there is no precedent."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; often into the coffin and wake up... often? Klein suddenly found out that his concerns were not in the real eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the “undead” of the “Death” route... Mr. Azick said before that he had stayed in this sequence for a long time, the meaning of the words That is, he has been promoted for a long time... Klein thought about it and asked with some anxiety:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Azick, Insz. Will you find that I am Klein Moretti?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is afraid of revenge on Benson and Melissa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He shouldn't have, at most I think we've known it for a long time, or you are simply mine, mine, the police say, my informant." Azick recalled the next way, "but that '0' seal may be noticed, but you don't have to worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Klein Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick didn’t know what to remember, his face suddenly became a bit weird, and he seemed to want to laugh and feel horrified:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The '0' seal will always try to write to his master, this should be its essence, will not change, so this key moment can make Ince Zangwei I don’t think it will take the initiative to disclose the information, unless it involves a place that cannot be explained.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Mr. Azick It was so convincing and well-founded that Klein breathed a sigh of relief and the cold seemed to be a little better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick sees it and adds one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are best to stay away from Baekeland in the near future De, Ings Zangweier may retaliate against you with the '0' seal, relying on your pseudonym.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as not in Beckland There is no problem, the '0' seal will not affect more than a metropolis. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have guessed, there is scope limitation... otherwise Ins Zangweier can completely hide in a small town in the South Chinaland and arrange leisurely The fate of all goals, do not have to worry about being found... Klein asked at his discretion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he finished, he licked his face and instantly changed back to the state of Tingen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick eyebrows fretting and nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem is not big."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back at the distant sight that he could not see:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I seem to be the church of the night Strong presence is on the line, you better not to be with me, so as not to be affected, huh, they are very interested in the extraordinary characteristics of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I am going out to sea, digesting the potion and looking for the mermaid. This is the condition for my promotion." Klein explained his plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azk has crossed his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mermaid? Become a dead mermaid Is it ok? I can find at least four."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should, no..." Klein reached over his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His intuition tells him that this is definitely not the case, but he plans to divination on the fog to confirm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick did not mention the dead mermaid, but said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the matter? Contact by messenger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courier... Klein suddenly guilty and guilty:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It was killed in the battle between me and Mr. A. It saved my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick glanced at him and shook his head and smiled: Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not care, as long as it is not killed by the angel-level powerhouse, or with a special method, as long as the underworld still exists, it can be slowly reborn there." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before this, similar messengers have, there are, and I can’t count how many. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger that looks so strong and so powerful has a legion? Klein opened his mouth and couldn’t speak.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His shame dissipated a lot, curiously asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Azick, the underworld, where is hell? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spiritual world, the accurate description is that it is a special place that ancient deaths have developed in the spiritual world. "Azuk is not concealed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient god of death? That should be the ancient god of the ancestor of the dead bird, Gary Carrie... The original underworld belongs to the spiritual world, no wonder The basic structure in occult is "real world - spiritual world - astral", does not contain the underworld and the abyss... Klein is about to ask the relevant questions, suddenly remembered something, and quickly said: <br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Azick, I got a 'Big Card' made by Russell the Great, which contains a high sequence of secrets, I think it can help you wake up more things, but You have to wait for a while, it is hidden in Beckland. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not mention a reward, fearing to reveal the secret of Tarot, the mysterious space above the fog and the "Justice", so this can only be used The euphemistic way thanked Mr. Azke for his help and dedication.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azczy looked at him with amazement, but eventually did not say anything, gently The first road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you get it back, let the messenger bring it to me, I will return it to you immediately after the study, or you can directly copy the corresponding content to me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and seemed to think of something, so he took out a thin glove made of human skin from his pocket and handed it to gram. Ryan Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have awakened the memory, no longer need it, huh, it is the relic of the pirate lieutenant, I have to do some seals, let It does not usually be hungry, but every time it is used, it must be fed with a human flesh and soul, otherwise it will engulf you. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
