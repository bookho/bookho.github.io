			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, hearing Bilt’s sigh, Sotos pressed the edge of his eye socket and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, the big man will arrive the day after tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilter looked back at the dignified look:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We only have two choices, one is regardless of whether or not German Sparrow Trustworthy, I entrusted the task to him, hoping to have the best results. Second, I immediately gave up the industry in Olavi, brought cash and jewelry to leave here, went to the ocean to be a pirate, I am sure to let the 'pirate hunter Most of the sailors and adventurers of the 'number followed us.' Sotos paused and added another sentence. "Hey, when you were an adventurer, led us to control the ships, hunting pirates, it was so determined and decisive, I I think you already have a decision and don't need me to do anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, don't need to compliment me." Bilt smiles Two words, "I am not the pirate hunter who was not afraid in the blood and artillery. The long-term ease of life has eroded my will. I don't even want to continue to seek opportunities for promotion. The companion who becomes a monster seems to still live in my mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... He vomited and his expression became serious:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, you are right, we have no hesitation, we must make a decision immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Bilt leaned over his head and pointed his finger at the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sotos was a glimpse, and immediately understood the meaning of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the "sweet lemon" bar, Klein strolls on the street, ready Go to the intersection and hire a rental carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he heard the window upstairs creaking and saw a figure falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the reason for the terrorist incidents of the Antignus family notes and the different telegraphs in Banxi, Klein’s first reaction was Bilt Brando After dying, after he visited him, he suddenly died and fell from the upstairs, landed on the ground, and his eyes were round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like when he first opened the door and saw Riel Bieber’s mother dying in the easy chair, the body was highly rotted, and the eyes were smashed by external vibrations. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar thought flashed past, and Klein saw that the figure falling from the upstairs was Sotos Young, not Bilt Brando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other party’s status is normal and obviously alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops, troubles come on... Klein has a sigh of relief and has a more accurate judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is doing himself, he will definitely pretend not to see Sotos. Yang jumped off the building to intercept himself, grabbed the other party’s opening, turned around and left, rushing Until you get rid of each other, just like the state of "the star above" will be chased by knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I am now Gelman Sparrow, a crazy adventurer can't escape because of this little thing... Hey, more clearly It’s an extra bonus. Klein stopped and watched Sotos wearing a linen shirt and a brown jacket steadily landing. He pressed his chest and gave a gift:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Gilman Sparo, we have a very important thing to entrust to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come... gram Ryan’s face responded calmly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’ve been idle recently.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will delay you too much time, you can listen to what you want to do first, then consider whether to refuse or accept." Sotos, who has a black beard and has a black beard, said sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m afraid to listen, I have to accept...the amount is actually okay, if Bilt Brando and Sotos. Forcing me to pick up the task, I don't mind turning them into gold pounds and extraordinary materials... Klein seriously thought that he didn't seem to have too much scruples at sea, and the pirate general's strength could basically be traversed in most places. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the gold-shelled pocket watch on the inside of the garment and glanced at it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give you 5 minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, enough." Sotos pointed to the entrance to the "sweet lemon" bar at the back of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the previous room, Klein looked at the wall clock and said indifferently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There are still 3 minutes and 12 seconds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of his inexplicable makes Bilt feel calm and begins to believe that Gilman Sparo has absolute The ability to complete the task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. German, I heard that you can change to look like anyone, just like the past 'Hurricane Lieutenant' Kiringes." Bilt Asked about the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who leaked this thing? Klein's eyebrows leaped and looked at Bilt's gaze instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German.Sparo can change into anyone. If it is spread, it is not a big problem for Klein. Because this is either reminiscent of "squirming hunger", reminiscent of the death of Qieringus, or being suspected of being a "faceless person" by a certain extraordinary person who is secretive. The former may lead to "the dusk hermit" Concerned, the latter has a high probability of paying attention to the Goddess Church and sending people to investigate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the Church of the Night God is not strong at sea, and Klein is not too worried, just not willing to clash with the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, he had to give up the identity of Gilman Sparo, and the image of an adventurer who is crazy, strong and soft. Widely known and recognized, gaining more and more feedback on key nodes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilter feels the change of Gilman Sparo's gaze, the whole person is tight, hehe laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the message that was uploaded from the black death number."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trea... she is retaliating against me, total One day, I was going to finish hunting for her... Klein nodded lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can be honest when this news."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not deliberately explain where the ability to change others came from, because it is in line with the design of the German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilter suddenly sighed and calmed down for two seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are helping one The big man is looking for a substitute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the unclear gaze of German Sparrow, he explained in detail:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The big man needs to act alone to deal with a hidden thing that cannot be known by others. Therefore, there must be a substitute to replace him in daily affairs, meet different guests, and deal with his mistress. Don't expose a little problem, and he can return in about three to five days.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have already found someone who looks a lot like him and spends a lot of time correcting His manners and accents, and reported this good news to the big man, who knows, the tramp overeating, and the disease died the night before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The big man is about to start his own actions. We don't have enough time to find another person who looks like him. I can only turn to you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the real chance I want to play... Klein is shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also keenly noticed a point:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be the leader of the "Adventurer Mutual Aid Society" Bilt Known as a big man, it must be a real big man. Things that surround the big man are often not simple, and there is no small risk! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it, low and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think this thing is dangerous? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, as long as you are not exposed, there will be no danger. All you need to do is to represent the big man on the open side, huh, No one dares to assassinate him, um... I know what you are worried about, afraid that the big man will kill all the insiders afterwards. Rest assured, the pirates have made a lot of vicious rumors about him, so if you end successfully, how can you leak later? This thing, no one will believe, will only be treated as a joke like rumors." Bilt smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
