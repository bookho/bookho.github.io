			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as Stuart’s aiming at the gun, Klein, who had been on alert, had already noticed that he had stepped forward with the other side’s movements. The ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stuart, whose emotions were clearly out of control, pulled the trigger and the bullet hit the side of a private detective and hit the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brushing brush, the rest of the detectives stressed pulled out their own revolver, it seems that everyone is an enemy, the scene is chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, Stuart and a private detective face are red, green and violent, and the eyes are burning with the "flame" of fear and anger. Like a so-called demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Caslana snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not very loud, but full of majesty, so that everyone in the room is trembled and unconsciously wants to obey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene was short and quiet, but the mood of the people did not seem to have actually improved. Klein had rolled over to the other direction and stood up with his own Revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His thoughts are rushing, and he is not allowed to hide. He intends to rely on the illusion ability to calm down several visitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the doorbell rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮叮当当当! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several private detectives slammed a clever, with a bit of clarity in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light doorbells are like a basin of cold water, poured over their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart looked at the revolver in his hand and whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just What are you doing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official extraordinary shots? Klein breathed a sigh of relief, carrying the revolver and approaching the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just took the handle and his mind naturally showed the appearance of someone outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Essinger Stanton with two white spots, a thin face, a deer hat and a black coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big detective’s face was a little pale, and his left arm was raised from the shoulder to the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is really fine! Klein was a happy first, and immediately became cautious - he still remembered that "the master of the secret master" Rosago became a familiar police officer to swindle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein fingers clasped the trigger, opened the door, and stepped back two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger. Stanton smiled and nodded to him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for this afternoon Visit, otherwise I may not be able to continue to hide and seek with the devil.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You saved my life. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... Is the correct interpretation of "suitable for visiting Essinger Stanton" is that going to him this afternoon can help him get rid of the danger? In the next few days, "should be visited"? Staggered the scene of the murder, not suspected? Klein was a little ridiculous.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not relax and vigilantly let go Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a minute. Essinger suddenly lowered his voice and smiled. "Do you want to discuss the topic of the extraordinary in front of Stuart?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you are so naturally and I am extraordinary? Also, I can stand still with the demon dog for more than ten minutes, which is enough to show that I am not Ordinary people... and I also provided advice on deliberately pointing to demonic animals... Klein quietly lags behind Essinger Stanton in two steps.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Mr. Stanton, are you okay?" they asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger moved his left arm slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After being hurt, but Not too serious.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, don't be nervous, things will soon pass, the police are waiting for the guy in the darkness nearby. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it because of the serial killings? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you lock the suspect? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will he hurt the innocent? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private detectives rushed to ask.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger under the palm of his hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t worry, I will tell you in detail, but Before that, there were a few questions I needed to find Sherlock and Caslana to know, we went to the living room for a few minutes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His long-standing prestige allowed the detectives to refute and sit down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although They are still not at ease, but there is no problem of anxiety and emotional out of control.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the living room, close the wooden door, Klein looked at the closed room Suddenly thought of one thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This environment is very suitable for items of the type "biotoxin bottle"!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough... Klein cleared his throat, went to the opposite side, opened the glass window.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still did not relax on Essinger Stein Don’t even think that Caslana is absolutely trustworthy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger took a circle and took the Klein easy chair directly, then Hehe laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am older, I still like to sit like this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat down on the single sofa and asked again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Stanton What happened? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aisinger looked at Kaslana after seeing the coffee table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We All are extraordinary, I will not explain the concept of common sense. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Extraordinary? "Caslana first looked at Klein and then looked at Essinger. It was a little weird but not too unexpected.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are also an extraordinary person. ...... How was it that I was stumped by a weak ghost, and I didn’t even see where the problem was... Well, maybe it’s not good at dealing with the sequence of Shadow Wraith creatures... Kline responded to Kaslana’s Eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to study in Rumburg for four years. There, he has come into contact with the extraordinary world and has become a believer in the god of knowledge and wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After returning to Beckland, I gradually established a good relationship with the military, the Church of the Night God, the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery, but still not Dare to really reveal your identity, because the punisher will definitely remove me as a cultist. In this matter, other official organizations will not directly help me, because it is equivalent to fighting the main church of the storm.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not the tyrant's church. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The tyrant? Klein asked casually.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger took out the pipe, but only sniffed the smell of tobacco:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I will go back to today's business, the person who attacked me, the person who sent you a threatening letter, the owner of the serial killer murderer, huh, you should know that the murderer is a 'devil' sequence. The black dog, especially Sherlock, you first pointed out that the demon might be an animal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein smiled, did not deny, and did not admit. Kaslana just handed her hands up and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger suddenly shakes his head and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to worry, I am not a law enforcer, and As a believer in the god of knowledge and wisdom, I can't teach in Beckland, I can't formally form an organization, I can only help you with people like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, can you help us back the pot? Klein tweeted in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger sees that they still have not admitted, continue to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The devil's dog The master is the strongest of the sequence 5, the amount, as far as I know, the sequence 5 of the 'demon' route is called 'desire apostle', able to use and manipulate each person's emotions and desires to induce them to fall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When faced with the 'desire apostle', there must be no strong emotional fluctuations, no obvious desires, or it will be controlled remotely by him or buried in the seeds. Or direct catalysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will expose a lot of problems, gradually fall, or get out of control at a critical moment, unable to resist... This is just some of the extraordinary ability of the 'desire apostle' I have confirmed this in the battle with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Klein Horan understood the other party’s threatening and provocative actions. One reason: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to irritate himself and let his emotions have a sharp volatility, so as to reach the fallen seeds or catalyze emotions, let it run out of control purpose! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will make his subsequent attacks easy and easy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, I have seen extraordinary people who have experienced a lot of things. At that time, they were only alert and cautious... Stuart should be seeing threatening letters. At that time, there was a more obvious emotional change, so the seeds were buried by the "desire apostle"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you fail to stabilize them in time, the scene will It became confusing from the inside, leaving the surrounding extraordinary people to react, leaving plenty of opportunities for the "desire apostles"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Essinger. The Stanton family feels that time is slow, because the emotions of sudden vigilance, tightness, and alertness are magnified? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Klein recalled, he was fortunate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out to be like this..." Kaslana also seems to understand a lot of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger smashed the forehead:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was almost manipulated by him, so After being injured, he used a magical item to catch up with him in the house until Sherlock visited, and the three parties were stalemate before they got a chance to breathe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "My poor assistant, I was still looking forward to the New Year's return to Rumburg for the Mass." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he sighed long.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the police arrived, I took the opportunity." After fleeing, I used the river to get rid of the tracking. Essing added a sentence and said, "Sherlock, Caslana, how are you going to deal with it?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caslana silent moments:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Stanton, do you have any suggestions? ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First accept the official protection, let the 'desire apostle' Not afraid to act, and hope that he will soon be caught or killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
