			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw Jurgen Cooper in an office at the Les Police Station, the young senior attorney still dressed very formal, Like a dinner that is always ready to attend the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Double-breasted black long dress, hard-necked white shirt, large bow tie, shiny leather boots, so the police are very polite to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgen holds a half-height silk hat, blue eyes look at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The procedures are all done, you can leave after paying 10 pounds of bail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Klein did not say much, followed Mr. Jurgen, who looks good but gives a feeling of old-fashioned, came to the financial office next to the police station, took out his wallet and smoked two five-pound notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very happy at this time to bring all his cash, £95, to his body, otherwise he might have to borrow from his good neighbor, Jurgen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the most serious thing is, if cash is placed at home, after the police’s on-the-spot search, how much can be left in the end, Klein really has no confidence, but he You can't put it on the fog, because you may end up with a bribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently many newspapers and magazines have been smashing the police, thinking that they lack supervision, doing things rudely, corrupting, often extorting, fierce and sinister, Kline does not dare to believe, But I don't dare not believe it. After all, the money from Mersor is likely to be cheaper for this police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After paying the bail, Klein followed Jurgen out of the police station and was beaten by the cold wind blowing in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After closing the case, your bail will be returned to you. Of course, you can't expect them to take the initiative to inform you, um... after a week, if not When people come to get you back to the police station, you can ask for bail here. In theory, you can finally get the corresponding compensation, from the other party's legacy, if any.” Jurgen is parked next to it. A carriage went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rainy days during the day have finally stopped, but the red moon is still covered by dark clouds, and only the gas lamps on the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein almost thought that the 10 pounds would not come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but calculate the commission of Ian, which paid 5 pounds, but the room was damaged by a lot of furniture and tea sets, and he had to buy it. New, or find someone to fix it, plus the cost of materials, the cost of the carriage and the cost of the next clothing repair, it seems probably a loss...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the 10 pound bail is not returned, then the loss is big! Um... The extraordinary features left by Mersor are worth a lot of money... Klein boarded the carriage and frowned slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always thought that private investigators who use their residences to do office work have no entrustment at all, and will not lose money. As a result...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at his eyes and sat down with Mr. Jurgen, and sincerely said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, thank you for taking the initiative to bail. I, how much should I pay for this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgen is very officially in the first place:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"This order is free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that Sergeant Fasin said about your business and believe that we have a lot of opportunities for cooperation in the future." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still many opportunities for cooperation in the future... Klein laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Urgen Lawyer, I think you are cursing me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgan solemnly shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not what you think, private detectives have a fixed cooperative lawyer. Often things "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;“Just I want to find a lawyer and help me draft an investment contract.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Investment contract?” Jurgen said slightly in a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know this is not a private detective, but I happen to meet a good investment opportunity." Klein briefly explained, "Jurgen lawyer According to your fees, how much does such a contract need to be paid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Generally, based on the total amount of the contract and the difficulty level." Jurgen He replied rigorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The total amount is £100, and the required terms are..." Klein described his needs in detail, including first-time subscriptions, negative rights, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgan seriously thought for a few minutes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2 pounds, Monday morning for you "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein didn't say much more about it, but instead asked about what happened to Jurgen's case tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way back to Minsk Street, Klein took the initiative to pay 3 Soule’s rental carriage fee, bid farewell to the young but serious lawyer, and went to his own building. houses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door and seeing a messy scene, Klein was tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning of his private detective turned out to be a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Klein took off his coat and buried himself in the mess, the doorbell was suddenly ringing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the door with doubt and saw Julian, the maid next door wearing a black and white dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Moriarty, Mr. Summer and his wife want to invite you to talk about the past." Julian said with a little fear. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coming...the problem of compensation...Klein smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He changed his good clean jacket and followed the maid to the next door, Luke Samuel and his wife Starling Summer Is sitting in the sofa area of ​​the living room waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxury, Luke, with two beautiful moustaches, stood up and whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, Mr. Moriarty, I actually know that you are a private detective. Being a neighbor is really unqualified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, it's my own problem, because I don't know if I am suitable for this industry, maybe I will find another job." Klein and the male owner shook hands. "I am sorry about the matter tonight. I will make compensation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just an accident." Luke said with relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde blue-eyed and beautiful Stalin asked curiously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really Killed an intruder? Oh, I know you want black tea, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it’s just a thief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t say that the matter stemmed from the commission he accepted, lest the Summerrs have Mustard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the police did not tell them, I don’t have to do anything more... Klein silently added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke Samuel laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must have excellent fighting skills, As a neighbor, I feel very, safe, and maybe we will have something to entrust you in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is half-truth and laughs at himself:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter what, the ultimate winner is you," Luke said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking about this topic, Starling took a sip of white porcelain and gold teacup:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very curious, how many commissions can a private detective have in a week, how much is the income?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not conceal, hehe smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This depends on the situation, just as when the farmland has a bumper harvest and a poor harvest. I earned 5 pounds and 5 sores last week, but with the last night. And maybe, there will be a loss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starlin didn't seem to hear him in the back half of the sentence, said by himself:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can maintain this income, £5 a week will give you a pretty good life in Bakerland in the Jowood area, you don't need to rent a room, you can hire a maid to do chores. Listen to the concert every other week, or watch a dramatic opera, play tennis or squash once a week, attend a reading salon, go to a nice restaurant... Of course, if you are already In preparation for marriage, you need to save a little. The weekly salary of 5 pounds is far worse than the real decent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How much does it cost to earn a real decent?" Klein asked with a match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"7 pounds, at least 7 pounds." Stalin slightly lifted his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned to Luke and said casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I listen to you Mrs. said, you are doing things at Coim, don't know what your main business is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anthracite and charcoal." Luke smiled and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder you can be a member of the Soot Reduction Association... Klein has indulged: "How much will the managerial salary be in Beckland? I read newspapers and magazines rarely mention this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, this must look at what industry, what company, and the specific position, Bakerland Bank The first manager's annual salary is 5,000 pounds, and I count the bonus, which is only between 430 and 440 pounds." Luke said casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s about 8 pounds a week... No wonder... Kline hasn’t had time to speak, and Starling Summer has complained:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, we can live in the suburbs, then I will have a garden and a lawn, and Luke will also get a stable, buy a new coach that he thought for a long time and Two young horses, but this will make him waste too much time on the way to and from work, which is even more precious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new carriage with horses About 100 pounds... The weekly salary of 8 pounds is really amazing, but unfortunately I didn’t take long after I got a salary... Klein can only smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a few words, he left and left, and he secretly sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somer Mr. and Mrs. and Mrs. are still good people in nature. If they change to a mean-natured landlord, they will go out tonight and deduct the money and let me get out of the way...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When he returned home, Klein began to work, not eager to look at the warmth of the previous hand on the fog, and did not rush to do divination, because he was worried that the military special department was still staring at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to go to the bar described by Ian to buy guns tomorrow night to deal with attacks that some people might take. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein even intends to find a channel to hire bodyguards, extraordinary bodyguards, powerful extraordinary bodyguards, this is the opportunity to not expose themselves to contact the extraordinary circle Second, the followers who were afraid of the ambassador’s search were able to survive the military’s special department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a meta 8 person, a secret "revenge evil spirit" needs to find a bodyguard, it is a little funny, but to Klein In terms of safety, safety is the most important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the price is too expensive, I will blow the copper whistle to find Mr. Azke, of course, this may be more dangerous... I am not enough for the seal "0-08" Understand... In the room, Klein muttered silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
