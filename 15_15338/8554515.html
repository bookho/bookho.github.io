			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A touch of pale gold streamed in a blink of an eye, hitting a seemingly empty space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there was a sudden flame of smoldering, and a figure of wearing a black tuxedo and a dark red cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left arm position of this figure burned a sacred and clear flame, constantly emitting a black and green smoke, reflecting his pale face It’s a dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a middle-aged man in his forties. His hair is neat and combed, his face is shiny, he is meticulous, his eyes are dark and green, and there is no feeling. There is no pain at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resentment" Steve! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His head twisted, and Mulberry looked at Klein at the top of the warehouse with a malicious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein suddenly stunned and felt that his body suddenly became cold, even if the hot feeling brought by the "sun brooch" could not be offset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body is rapidly stiff, his eyes become dull, and his nephew reflects two identical figures:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black tuxedo, dark red cloak, big back with oily hair, flashing green eyes, pale face in forty years old! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost instantaneously, Klein was controlled and his thoughts gradually blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the ability of Sequence 5 "Resentment"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Differently difficult to defend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, he knows enough in advance that he has long been prepared, and the effect of "exorcism" can effectively resist the possession of evil spirits, so Before his ability to think completely disappeared, he swayed the spirituality that originated in the spirit, and poured it into the dark golden sunbird brooch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he raised his hand and grabbed his neck, he suddenly lowered a clear and pure warm glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like a beam of light from the country of the sun, bringing a splendid feeling and divine purification, completely enshrining Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell in the solar field, "Summon the Light"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Holy Light, the power of invisible control was suddenly weakened, and Klein’s eyes were restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his figure burned and became brittle, leaving only a thin piece of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the gap between the two warehouses, in the flame of the explosion, wearing a black double-breasted long dress, wearing the same color Klein jumped out of the half-high silk hat. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His cane has not been known where he lost it. The same figure floating on his head was successfully eroded by the flames, turned into pieces of ashes, and sprinkled in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein still has to confirm his situation in the future, he feels that his ankle is caught by invisible things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His calves, his arms, the clothes on his chest and behind him are also firmly held! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the already-opened vision, Klein saw a vague and transparent figure, some of which were incomplete, some bloody, some epidermis Charred black, some pale and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein’s neck blew a chilly wind that didn’t know where it originated, which made him sweaty and hard to contain. The body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark golden sunbird brooch in front of him suddenly flashed a glimmer of light, surrounded by a single golden flame of illusion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These flames radiate the breath of the sun, and become densely connected to the ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "fire of light" from the "sun" field! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scary ghosts around Klein silently screamed and disappeared, and the gale behind his head was replaced by the heat of the "sun brooch." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this environment, Klein has become safe for a while, and he can't help but sigh with fear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even if he is prepared in advance and has restrained each other Items, in the face of the "hate" of the sequence 5, the single-on-one is still in jeopardy, "performance" almost ended in failure at the beginning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not far from Maric, Steve’s figure with a dark red cloak is a little illusory, and his left-arm burning flame is black. The former servant was soon completely extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His flashing green and lustrous eyes are full of malice and desire, and seem to have lost his mind and lost his ability to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, with the reminder of the shot just now, Maric has already distanced him from the distance and directed the climb from the soil, the expression is numb The living corpses chased and intercepted the "wolf" Tyre, and they circled around the circle to create smooth thin ice and decaying mud, trying to influence each other's actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Werewolf" Tyre holds the blushing blush of the full moon, running without stopping, until it was accidentally blocked by the living body, and then grabbed it. Go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swipe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living corpse was split directly into six pieces, and the rotten flesh and squirming mites that had long since rotted spilled over the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Werewolf" Tell stunned and looked at his claws unbelievably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands that the bonus of "Crimson Moonlight" is more than just speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels he has some powerful and weird spells! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell stopped escaping and turned to face the pale-looking Maric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "living corpse" Jason is getting closer and closer to the illusory but mysterious door. His body is full of highlights. The black-black vine of the baby's face, he was dragged by an arm that was only full of teeth or without skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes almost snapped into the gap between the bronze gates, and a cold, invisible scorpion hidden in the depths of the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be his hometown of the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body opening controlled by the killing and bloodthirsty desire shouted out Extremely stern! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Wolfman" that was to be counterattacked, and suddenly bite his teeth and threw out the miniature version of the blushing full moon in his hand and threw it at him. Resentment, Steve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only if the strongman of sequence 5 recovers strength and gains, the battle will end soon, and the "living body" Jason will have a chance to be saved! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing this scene, Klein’s eyes lit up, and immediately raised his hand and snapped a finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the route of "Crimson Moonlight", a pre-embedded bomb picked up the dirt and blew out a strong wind that was full of impact. A red flame was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crimson Moonlight" was "taken" for a moment, turning a small corner and falling in the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another bomb that bursts open, and a burst of fire, Klein jumped out and threw himself into the “red moon” not far from this position.冕". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, in front of the "Crimson Moon" trajectory, a pale palm appeared and steadily caught it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "resentment" Steve who doesn't know what has disappeared and reappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His instinct lets him chase the full moon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! In a slight voice, Steve took the "dark red moon", and the dark green eyes full of malice and desire added a touch of spiritual brilliance, which allowed him to return from pure resentment to the strongest of sequence 5. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He outlined his mouth and sneered at Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not in a hurry to solve this weak opponent, but to make the figure disappear again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who had already rushed out, rolled twice on the spot, leaned his left hand into the pocket, and then lightly opened the iron cigarette case again, touching Luo Sag's "All Black Eyes." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the slang of his tears that couldn’t stop the flow, Klein saw another strange black line and saw it disappear from their place. "Resentment" Steve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is approaching Sharon, who is weak on the ground, to control the other side, save the "living body" Jason, and completely end the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon is the main goal of this action! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein jerked back into his left hand and infused his mind into the "sun brooch" again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2!1! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A clear and pure sacred beam of light descended from the sky, fell, and shrouded to the rear of Sharon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve’s figure with a dark red cloak suddenly flashed a few meters away, and dangerously avoided the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His speed in the "Crimson Moon" bonus, it is terrible to be able to make effective dodge in an instant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, Klein, who was half-squatting on the ground, had raised his right hand and pulled the trigger of the revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His goal is "live corpse" Jason! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A brightly-lit bullet flew out, facing Jason’s back, to “help” him into the mysterious door of bronze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Steve’s figure disappeared and flashed behind Jason’s, with the open left palm blocking the exorcism bullet. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zizizi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outbreak of sunlight caused him to shake his arms in pain, his eyes narrowed, his skin was constantly blackened, but he quickly healed and reborn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he heard a bang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein made another snap! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bomb that is not far from the vicinity exploded, and the shockwaves and bullet-like stones that spread out spread out in all directions<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large part of it was taken in the "live body" Jason and "resentment" Steve! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a scream, Jason’s side clothing was broken, skin There was a white mark that turned deeper and deeper, as if blood was about to overflow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not too effective damage for a living body like steel, but it is death for Jason, who is struggling to support it. Call of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can no longer support, and was pulled into the gap of the bronze gate by the strange and terrible arm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jason's screams are far away, that mysterious The illusion of the door slammed, and the latter half of the sound was completely swallowed up, isolated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open space enclosed by the warehouse was quiet, and the "living body" Jason completely disappeared, as if it had never been born in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resentment" Steve’s eyes wide open, his mouth open, and an angry scream:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
