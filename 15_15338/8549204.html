			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is whistling, the rain is like a note, the three-masted sailboat undulates between the waves of the "mountains", like the giants throwing and catching, catching A toy that throws away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger Wilson's eyes faded and found himself standing on the deck, no different from the previous one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, he saw the squeaky glass bottle in the palm of his hand broken, the snow and snow, and the raindrops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After just two or three seconds, this ancient creature completely lost the traces that once existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A hexagonal crystal snowflake emerged in Alger’s palm, then quickly faded until it disappeared, seemingly shrinking into flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger nodded as if he was thinking about what was invisible, and calmed for five minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his body and walked to the entrance of the cabin. Just entering the door, he met a man wearing the embroidered lightning pattern robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man with a soft yellow hair paused, looking at Alger, extending his right hand, clenching his fist on the chest:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The storm is with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The storm is with you." Alger's rough face does not have a little extra The emotions, the same right holding the right boxing left chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After each other, Alger enters the cabin and walks along the aisle to the captain’s room in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way, he didn’t even meet any sailor or crew. It was quiet as if it were inside the grave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain’s room door opens, and a soft, thick dark brown carpet appears in front of his eyes, on both sides are bookshelves and wine cabinets, a book with yellowed cover and A bottle of dark red wine sparkles with a strange glow under the radiance of the candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bottle of ink on the desk where the candle is placed, a feather pen, a black metal telescope, and a sextant made of brass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the desk, a middle-aged man with a long cap and a pale face looked at Alger step by step and said with angrily:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't give in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe you can do it." Alger calmly like Said that the weather is not very good today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." The middle-aged man stunned and didn't seem to expect such an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Alger’s body bowed slightly and suddenly rushed forward, bringing the distance between the two closer to the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a tight shoulder and his right hand slammed out and pinched the throat of a middle-aged man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no chance to respond to the other party, and he showed a piece of illusory fish scales on his back, and the five fingers were crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the crisp sound, the middle-aged man looked up and his body was lifted up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His feet twitched violently, but he quickly recovered calm, his eyes stunned, his pupils began to diverge, his crotch position became moist, and there was a stench. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger raised his middle-aged man, squatting his back, his feet squatting, and approaching the wall next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! He used the middle-aged man as a shield and slammed into the front, his arms thick like monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls of the wooden walls are shattered, and the violent wind and rain are swept in with the tidal wave of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger twisted his back and threw the middle-aged man out of the cabin and threw it into the waves like a mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness of the sky, the wind and the wind, the power of nature buried everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger pulled out a white handkerchief, rubbed his right palm with his heart, and threw it to the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps back, he patiently waited for his companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" In less than ten seconds, the man with soft yellow hair just rushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The captain' has escaped." Alger gasped and annoyed and replied, "He still has some extraordinary power!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" The yellow-haired man whispered a curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to the breach and stared into the distance, but nothing could be seen except the wind and the waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, he is only attached." The yellow-haired man waved his arm. "You can find the ghost ship of this era, we only have Thanks for the merits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is the leader of the sea, he does not dare to sneak into the water in this weather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And if the storm continues, the 'Captain' will not last long." Alger nodded and found the crack on the wooden wall began to the naked eye. Visible velocity creep recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep look and turned his head to look at the rudder and sail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if there are heavy planks, he can clearly know the situation there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mate, no second officer, no crew, no sailors, no living people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in it, the rudder and the sails are adjusted in a strange way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a "fool" in the mind that was covered with gray and fog, and Alger suddenly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and looked at the wind and waves, and said with a dream of expectation and fear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The new era has begun..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luen Kingdom Capital Bakerland, Queens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey Hall pinched his cheek and couldn’t believe what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the dressing table in front of her, the old bronze mirror was broken piece by piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down, Audrey saw a "dark red" flow in the back of his hand, like a star "tattoo." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crimson" gradually fades and eventually hides in the skin and disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, Audrey determined that she was not dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a flow of her eyes, her mouth was a little upturned, she couldn’t help but stand up and bent over the skirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the air, Audrey's footsteps are brisk, his body turns, and he jumps up to the most popular "Ancient Elf Dance" in the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure is full of bright smiles on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚! The door to the bedroom was suddenly ringed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who?" Audrey stopped the brush and set a graceful gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss, can you come in? You should be ready." The close-up maid asked outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey looked sideways at the mirror of the dresser, and quickly converges with a smile, leaving only a light touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks left and right, confirms that the image has no problem and then gently opens:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handle twisted and her close-fitting maid Anne pushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, it's broken..." Annie saw the end of the old bronze mirror at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey blinked and said slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃, yes Well, before Su Shi came in, you know, it always likes to destroy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi is a golden dog with a less pure pedigree, is Her father Hall Earl received a gift from the Foxhound, but was very popular with Audrey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to teach it well." Anne carefully picked up the bronze mirror fragments, fearing that she would hurt the lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, she looked at Audrey and smiled and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which dress to wear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey said with a little thought: "I like the one that Mrs. Ginya designed for my seventeenth birthday." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, others will say whether the Hall family has suffered a financial crisis, and a skirt actually wears a second time on formal occasions!" Anne shook her head and denied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I really like it." Audrey emphasizes the temperature and the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can wear it at home and wear it on less formal occasions." Anne did not discuss this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The one that Mr. Seddes sent the day before, the cuff is the one on the ruffle." Audrey took a sigh of relief and kept it. Live an elegant sweet smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your eyes are always so good." Annie smiled and stepped back and shouted outside the door. "No. 6 cloakroom, forget it, I go by myself. Take."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maids are busy, one is responsible for the long skirt, one is responsible for jewelry, one is responsible for shoes, one is responsible for the yarn hat, and one is for Miss Audrey makeup. One considers hairstyle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When preparing to come to an end, Earl Hall, wearing a dark brown vest, appeared at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears a matching color hat with two beautiful moustaches, azure eyes full of smiles, but loose muscles, belly The beginning of the obvious decree pattern, ruthlessly destroyed his handsome youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beckland's most dazzling gems, we should set off." Earl Hall stood at the entrance and tapped the open door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, don't call me that." Audrey stood up under the help of the maid, deliberately showing a bit of distressed look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then my beautiful little princess, it’s time to go." Earl Earl bent his left arm and gestured to Audrey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey smiles and shakes his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Mrs. Hall, Countess, I Dear mother's position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's here." Earl Hall smiled and bent his right arm. "This is the pride of the father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritzport, Oak Island, Royal Naval Base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Audrey took his father’s arm and walked off the carriage, he was suddenly shocked by the huge behemoth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the military port not far away, there is a huge ship with a metallic light shining. It has no sails, only the observatory, and more Two towering chimneys, two more open-air turrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is so majestic, so large that the sailboats that are parked nearby are like a newly born dwarf in a cluster of giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The storm is on..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, my Lord."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Iron Ship!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing low and low, Audrey also feels The same shock, it is a miracle created by mankind, an unprecedented miracle of the ocean! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, the nobility, the ministers and the lower house members recovered. At this time, a black spot in the air changed from small to large, gradually occupying a three-thirds. A sky, occupying everyone's sight, makes the atmosphere suddenly solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a giant flying object floating in the air, it has extremely smooth and beautiful lines, painted in a deep blue, solid and light alloy The skeleton supports a cotton cloth with a hydrogen air bag, and the bottom is a box with a organic muzzle, a projectile port, and a flat-shot muzzle. The exaggerated squeak of the high-volume steam engine and the crazy rotation of the tail blade constitute a shocking Music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The airship of the King’s family arrived, with a high ceiling above all the majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vertical down, the handle is the ruby ​​crown of the "Judge of the Sword" badge reflects the sun on both sides of the car, this is Augustus The family heritage can be traced back to the symbol of the last century. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey has not yet reached the age of 18, has not participated in the "introduction ceremony", and under the guidance of the Queen, officially entered the social occasion of Beckland, proclaiming adulthood. You can only sit quietly in the same place, not close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she didn't care too much, even because she didn't have to face the princes and felt relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "troll" of the human conquering the sky has steadily landed. The youngest guards who came down from the escalator were the red-haired military dresses and white trousers. With a honour, holding a rifle, it is divided into two rows, waiting for the appearance of King George III and the queen, the prince, and the princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey is not a big man who has never seen it. He has no interest in it. Instead, he looks away from the two black knights who look like statues to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this era of steel, steam and guns, there are even guys who insist on wearing full body armor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold metal luster, the deep black helmet, gives a heavy, majestic, obedient feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a higher sequence of 'discipline knights'..." Audrey’s heart flashed through the words of the elders in the family’s chat, and they were insightful, but not Dare to be close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the arrival of the King’s family, the ceremony finally began, and the current Prime Minister, Lord Agusid Nigen, came to the front of the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a member of the Conservative Party, and so far the only person who became a prime minister in a non-aristocratic status was awarded the Lord for his outstanding contribution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Audrey knows more, Aguhid’s brother, the main supporter of the Conservative Party, called Pallas Nigan, this generation Duke of Nigan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aguchide is fifty years old, tall and thin, with thin hair and sharp eyes, looking around after a circle:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe you have seen it. This is an ironclad ship. It is enough to subvert the Ironclad ship of the era. It is 101 meters long and 21 meters wide. It has a high dry ship side design and the main armor belt is 457 mm thick. The displacement is 10060 tons. There are four 305mm main guns in front and behind. There are also 6 speed guns, 12 6-gun guns, 18 six-barrel machine guns and 4 torpedo tubes. The speed can reach 16 knots!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will be the real hegemon, it will conquer the sea!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility, ministers and parliamentarians appear The commotion, the description of the Prime Minister alone is enough for them to imagine the horror of this ironclad ship, not to mention the real thing is in sight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agusid smiled a little and gave a few more speeches, then prayed to King George III:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, please name it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the port of Pritz, it is called Pritz." George III’s look is quite Pleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Plitz!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
