			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with the past, "Sun" Dairik is obviously a lot smarter, not awkwardly only by language description. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After winning the agreement of Mr. Fool, he showed a picture that he could recall, and he will explore the course of his exploration and his own focus. The intermittent way is presented in front of the "downside down", "justice", "magician" and "world", and then supplemented with certain explanations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall that collapsed in the darkness, the streets that pass through the ruined buildings, the light of the animal lanterns shines in the dusty white and blue. The ancient temple supported by the stone pillars, the statue that hangs on the dark cross, depicts a series of murals that "fallen the Creator" replaces human beings, the unusually beautiful "mushroom", the altar of the gods with strange eyes, and The scenes of the yellow-haired boy Jack, who was hiding behind, formed one by one, and they were reflected in the eyes of the members of the Tarot Society in the most direct and true way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gloomy style, the atmosphere of the step-by-step crisis, the development that is full of surprises, makes the "justice" Audrey look quite excited, resulting in Unusually strong interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the situation around Silver City...all the novels I have seen are appealing...this is the charm of mystery, unknown and terror... Of course, this is not good for the human beings living there... Audrey's thoughts are divergent, and I can't wait to be a strongman of the demigod and the half-human level, and venture to the area ruled by darkness and storms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Fool" Klein looked a little embarrassed and emotional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their thing is that Silver City can be maintained in this environment to this day, it is quite difficult, and the feeling is that the small "sun" is still not alert enough. Nothing to see, otherwise he can complete the things he has experienced in the form of a documentary or a movie. Absolutely exciting, absolutely attractive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in this way, the time of telling will become longer, my spirituality can't support everyone to watch a movie here, and, the fog The longer you stay on, the higher the chances of a bad change in the outside world... Klein suddenly has some luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger quietly read it, reminiscent of it, let the "Sun" highlight the key points he once again on the bronze long table Above, there is a mural depicting the "fallen creator" against the six "evil gods." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What evil spirits is this?" Alger looked at the lightning bolts, the black waves on his feet, the cloak of the bird feathers, and the octopus head with a three-legged long scorpion. Monsters, some inexplicable in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik shook his head honestly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I thought you would "Knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey and "Magic" Firth also cast their eyes on the past, carefully observed several times, still no guess Object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They originally thought that this is the six ancient gods in the legend of Baiyincheng, but they can't find enough correspondence. After all, there are dragons in the ancient gods. There are elves, giants, undead birds, and devils, and there is only one giant above the murals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This..."The Fool" took a serious look and the pupils almost contracted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just took care of his stance. He didn’t see the mural on the first time. Now he finally found it wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very close to the six-god statue I saw in the underground remains of the Tuyu family, but one is the normal version, and the other is the blackened and fallen version... It’s really a bit daunting, especially the Mother Earth, the Lord of the Storm, and the Eternal Sun, which have not only been turned into evil spirits, but also closer to ugly monsters... Klein has not found the truth of the truth, "real It is his expectation that the Creator "smashed the six gods and distorted the image." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, you can’t completely ignore the possibility of this mural, just as I always thought that there is no human image, only symbols, the result The statues in the underground ruins of the family made me less uncertain... It seems that the establishment of the image of the gods has a long history, and there are a lot of secrets... Klein sees the "Justice" in the examination of the murals, and does not pay attention to the "fool" "Mr.'s attitude, my heart suddenly relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it involves the small "sun" to get rid of the strange dilemma that repeats a short life, he decided to tell the story he knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the lengthy introduction introduces and reveals that the image of the six gods in the underground remains does not conform to the identity of the "fool". He intends to manipulate the "world" to accomplish this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also consistent with his idea of ​​equating the "world" with Sherlock Mori. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "fool" should be inscrutable to say "night, sun, storm, wisdom, earth, giant", then do not explain, do not give one Ding points extra description... Klein thought for two seconds, let the "world" hoarse and open: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen similar statues."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After attracting everyone’s attention, he paused and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The adventures of the ruins of the ruins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey is very interested in this, but the surface maintains basic support:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. 'World', what kind of statue is it? Can you show us something? Of course, if you don't want it, or you need to pay, you can talk about it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, because this can also solve some doubts for me." "The world" gloomy smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pretended to make a request to Mr. "fool", and after getting permission, the six god statues and the corresponding holy emblems that he saw were presented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillows in the moon, the ladies who are stacked and not complicated are seemingly embarrassing, but give a very beautiful feeling, above her black dress There is also a little bit of starlight, like the sky in the middle of the night, coupled with the iconic darkness of the holy emblem, "justice" Audrey immediately recognized this is the goddess of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statue is similar to the evil spirit in the upper left corner of the mural, but the face is closer to humans, and there is no one hidden in the surrounding environment. Weird eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;亵渎! This is the goddess of the goddess! Audrey horror was a little angry, but quickly calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the most famous evil god, the "real creator" makes the believer ugly the goddess is something that can be expected... But why is there a humanoid statue of the goddess in the underground ruins? ... Isn't it true that God only has symbols? Audrey frowned and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"""""" The mural is a distorted image of the six gods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He used to have a human image..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This may be the reason why several churches have always wanted to find the land of God's abandonment... and the land of God's abandonment is probably deep in the sea of ​​Sunia, um, certainly not in a normal state. Otherwise, the gods can't find it... Alger silently added two sentences in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sun" is a glimpse first, immediately realize:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'Inverted Man', is this the goddess of the night, the Lord of the Storm, etc.? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "The hangman" gives a positive response.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do they have to do with the end?" What is the relationship with the land where we are located? "The Sun" Dairik asked subconsciously.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, no one can answer him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Magic" Firth raised his doubts with some doubts:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is there no god of steam and machinery? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the god of her faith.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the North and South continents, it has always been the Seven Gods !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rumored god of steam and machinery, the original god of craftsmen, was born until the Quaternary, it seems that this is true, and He was born The nodes seem to be in the middle and late Quaternary, not early and mid-term..." "Put the man" is half explained by speculation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
