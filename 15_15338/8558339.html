			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the "world" does not have the ability to be old-fashioned, and his state will not change as long as it is not manipulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smirked and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will take a few more days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Justice" Audrey nodded and did not rush, because Su Shi has not expressed the desire to upgrade the sequence recently, after all, she is just a dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "downside down", "moon" and "sun" are still in aggression spirituality, practicing new extraordinary ability because they have just been promoted for a few days. At the stage, there was no impulse to purchase the follow-up potion formula and the corresponding bloodline heritage in a short period of time, and it was calmly waiting for the transaction link to pass. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their funds are not plentiful, although the "downside down" Alger sold the bloody baron's estate to the £4,300 plus a commission of 300 pounds after the "price reduction" "Moon" Emlin White, who earned 1400 pounds, but bought "spiritual whip" made him spend a lot of money, currently only 1445 pounds of cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Emlin’s purchase of the Blood Baron’s heritage, new dolls and doll dresses, there is a deposit of 2,300 pounds, which seems to be rich, but can be followed by the Viscounts. The minimum is no less than 8,000 pounds, and the "Sun" Dairik has already exchanged the accumulated merits before waiting for the patrol or mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic" Firth and "Justice" Audrey also did not purchase the potion formula of the latter sequence, because they each have channels to obtain, and not Need to hide, there is no need to waste another sum of money at the Tarot meeting - Audrey is just not thinking about money, not stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "hidden" Jia De Li Ya is still observing, not eager to expose his own needs, and secondly, the Tarot will not be considered as a "fool" The members can get what she wants. After all, for a pirate general who has been promoted for more than 5 years, the most eager for him is only the semi-god, so her eyes are so deep and so calm. The opposite "Sun" and others did not try to open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it and manipulated the "world" to add one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who has , or who can get magical items with strong attack power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal he asked was "hidden" because there are only "stars" that have been in the sea for many years. Admiral "may meet his needs, even the "downside down" and the craftsman he knows well, unless he can provide the corresponding sequence 6 or even the sequence 5 extraordinary characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Hidden" Jia Delia was silent for two seconds and slowly shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If there are similar items appearing at the extraordinary party I am participating in, I will help you pay attention to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many extraordinary people who have killed her over the years. There are indeed a certain number of extraordinary characteristics and magical items, but either rewarded to the pirates, or replaced with two powerful items that greatly enhance her strength and survivability, and there is no surplus, and the two pieces are promoted in her. Before the demigod, it is impossible to trade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that "the star will be" is not pleasing, and the power is also meant to be expensive... Klein sighs and makes the "world" dumb Thank you very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transaction is coming to an end, he manipulates the "world" and looks to the "magician" Fols:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to entrust you to do something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?" Firth was a bit surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it be something like buying a radio receiver? Her mouth frowned and thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"World" nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Walcome to the junction of the West End and Queens Turn around the street, go once every two or three days, pay attention to whether there is any abnormality, if there is, immediately inform me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not mention the "fool" The thing that Mr. transits, because everyone is already familiar and skilled, and the underground of Williams Street is the ruin of the family of the evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there an abnormality in Williams Street in Beckland? "Justice" Audrey was not interested in this topic, but at this time he almost raised his ears, which is very concerned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——She has considerable trust in Mr. World’s intelligence capabilities, and the Bakerland smog event is one of the proofs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western District, Queens...It sounds like Beckland in the capital of Lun... "Magician" is currently in Beckland? Sure enough, she seems ordinary, not simple. For a hidden organization, the members of the metropolis are often more powerful than others... Of course, she may be like me, because the help is pulled in, belonging to the fate Coincidence... "The Hidden" Jia De Liya swept the "Magic" Firth and quickly analyzed the information revealed in the dialogue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Upside down man” Alger was suddenly excited because he knew that “the world” was the representative of the “fool”, and the other party’s unusually high probability Involved in high-level battles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What secret is there in the street named Williams? Alger is hard to contain the deep truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I know what's going on? Klein sighed and made the "world" gloomy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you think is abnormal enough.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need to remind you that if you find an abnormality, don't try to investigate it yourself. Or entrust others to investigate, which can be dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much do you think is appropriate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very dangerous..."Magician" Buddha Ersson instinctively wants to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be considered that the impact of the last Beckland smog was so great that she was almost affected, and this anomaly may not harm her. She became hesitant again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, she changed her lazy sitting position:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"100 pounds." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Less than I thought." "World" smiled low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Firth spreads the hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because this is also for me Self."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you go to observe nearby pedestrians, collect novel material... Also, I can’t stay at home, I’ll go out and have to play The 'Master of the Master' is on the agenda, and it’s impossible to digest it by changing the trick. How do you play it? Going to the circus to perform tricks? Or do you perform independently in each square? This does not need to worry about how an acquaintance sees it. As a writer, experiencing life is a basic matter... The idea of ​​Firth is gradually diverging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finalizing this matter, Klein turned the "world" around his head and looked at the "downside down man", sullenly laughing:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I received the news, the storm church started, the things in Banxi have been solved initially."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At sea, Alger, who had no connection with the church, immediately replied: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the final result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be no Banxi Ports in existence for a while." "World" answered with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until this time, "Justice" Audrey and other talents reacted to what they were discussing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the place where the famous Banxi ancient name is Binxi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is where the descendants of the Angel of God, Medici, live! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. "World" means that the Storm Church has smoothed Bansie Port? It’s their style, so it’s good, don’t worry that the innocent people there are polluted... I don’t know if the Angel King Medici has appeared, has he escaped, whether the Pope Church’s pope has come to the scene, is there any use of “0”? "The seal..." "Justice" Audrey sighed with a sigh of relief, and her eyes opened brightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
