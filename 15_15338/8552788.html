			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queenstown, an inconspicuous house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh and Fols are free to find a place to sit and look at the entries written on the surface of the blackboard. Mr. A, wearing a hooded robes, is still quiet. Sitting alone on the foremost sofa, I looked at everyone with a condescending attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 8 'Sheriff'' formula recipe, 450 pounds..." Hugh read out the familiar content silently, and my heart sighed for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things she is most afraid of is that she has saved enough money, and no one has sold the formula! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I got 400 pounds, plus the original savings of 150 pounds, enough...the main material for the follow-up is definitely a lot of money...ah Yes, maybe I can change the circle to see if there are any extraordinary people interested in this formula...” Hugh suddenly felt refreshed and felt that he had found a way to make a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, if it’s not urgently needed to buy materials and make a potion promotion, she will definitely not leak the formula, on the one hand because most people always It is hoped that the extraordinary number of its own sequence is small and special enough. On the other hand, because the competitors of the same route have more, the corresponding material prices will be raised a lot, and the subsequent formulas are the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a while, Hugh slowly becomes awkward, because it is normal for a recipe to be sold for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "arbitrator" approach is a sequence of royalties belonging to the military, all aspects are strictly controlled, and the parts scattered are basically derived from A small number of broken aristocrats, their formula is difficult to constitute a complete low-to-low path, often only one or two, coupled with the control of the main materials, difficult to obtain, the extraordinary person willing to choose this sequence is quite rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few mysterious circles in Bakerland have been around for a long time, but they have not found an "arbitrator" other than her. The aspect may be that the other party is well covered, and on the other hand, it explains more or less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, think about Fols, I am lucky enough, she has not encountered any formulas of "apprentices" for so long... Mr. A’s waiter came over and wrote a note to buy the “Sheriff’s Official” formula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, she was led to the study on the first floor, before getting started, took a hooded robes from the waiter’s hand, covered in On the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sellers in the study are the same dress up, they can not see each other's looks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the formula of the 'Security Officer' potion, my money?" The seller asked the paper on the desk with a hoarse voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have out cash that has already been counted several times and pushed it to the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After checking the true and false and the total amount, the seller finally released the hand according to the formula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurry immediately stepped forward and grabbed the note quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her gaze is directed at the main material section, which is the focus of the focus:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" A pair of eyes that fear the worm, the right palm of the silver-white war bear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the extraordinary materials that I know but haven’t seen anyone sold... Tooth, slightly exited the study and took off his robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the living room, sitting next to Fols, completing a wish, she gradually worries about the unnamed name and the evil spirits that may be entangled in her own . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"10, no, 20 pounds, no, 30 pounds, please excel in exorcism to help me with the purification ceremony." Resting with determination, and Foers low I exchanged a few words and summoned Mr. A’s waiter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the rest period where they can communicate freely, they see the item on the blackboard that they just submitted:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Suspected evil spirits, asking for help from a friend who excels at exorcism, 30 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Mr. A’s waiter came The two sides were sideways and whispered to the living room on the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a man waiting for a white hard-shelled mask. He looked at the two helpers who had loose robes and didn’t know the sex. They laughed softly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be a preliminary self-introduction, lest you doubt my ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, we believe Mr. A." Hooded face Said before the opening of Fulth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She deliberately pressed the scorpion to prevent the childish voice from revealing her identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man with a white hard shell mask smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is mine Habit, I am a sun believer, you know, in Beckland, in the whole kingdom, this is not common."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only time I can live in a real identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the great contradiction between the Church of the Eternal Sun and the Church of the Lord of the Storm, the former has never been able to preach in the Kingdom of Lun s right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The believer of the sun?" Fols's lazy eyes disappeared. "This is the first time I saw a living sun believer! I can't see the high diplomats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So should I feel honored?" The man wearing a white hard shell mask spread his arms and went up. Make a gesture that praises the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falth did not answer his question and turned to smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exorcism and purification On the other hand, the sun's waiter is professional, we are at ease, we can start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who claimed to be a sun believer did not swear again, took out a picture The badge of the "Sun" symbol placed it on the central round table, and then lit two candles in a binary ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing the pre-events step by step, he was very loud and devoutly sympathetic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Eternal fierce sun;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the light of indestruction;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the embodiment of order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray to you;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for you Give me the light to purify;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for you to dispel the evil spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the resounding Hermes spell, Hugh and Folsch saw the pure warm, bright light on the sun badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It continues to flow into a tide, flooding the two and drowning them at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, everything is back to normal, Hugh and Fols only feel warm, very comfortable, very reassuring, it’s like a bubble Hot springs, or have a sunbathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joewood District, Les Police Station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is squeezing on a very short bench with a bunch of thieves, very decent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he felt that the position of the back of his hand seemed to be warm, and the coldness of Beckland’s night was dispelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down, Klein found that the four black spots that symbolize the mysterious space above the fog did not appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is so kind, I know that I was a little cold..." He was half joking and half confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a former inspector, he looked at the thief who was tortured on the left side of the pipe, and looked at the right side and could spit it out at any time but he always wanted to beat people. The drunkard, for a moment in the current situation, I do not know when to break free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be another test, and success will be achieved... I hope the police will pay attention to the ambassador and the Zmanger party, ignoring me. The identity of this little detective comes from a problem. In theory, the hope is great. As long as Mrs. Summer, Mr. Jurgen and others have not said anything that makes the police interested... Well, they and I just met. It is impossible to know too much..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Merso's extraordinary characteristics were taken away by me, hidden in the fog, and he did not leave strange places. No one can find that he used to be an extraordinary person, and he would not doubt my strength... Um... more than an hour..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein himself was relieved and saw the former sheriff with a brownish short beard under his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock. Moriarty, go to the interrogation room with me." The sheriff told me without explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come... Klein secretly said, got up and followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking around the corner, the sheriff stopped in front of an iron gate and signaled Klein to go in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a breath and slowly spit out, twisted the handle and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small room, the walls around it seem very thick, with a small table in the middle and chairs on each side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the elegant gas lamp on the wall, Klein saw the interrogator opposite, a man wearing a rare black shirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t have a vest, he wore a black jacket with a non-dress, his eyebrows were sparse, his blue eyes were cold, his face was like a blade, and he was hard enough to lack enough. Soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man pointed to the opposite chair and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked you A."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice has not fallen, Klein feels unimaginable oppression, only feels that there is a flow of current in his own spirit, even into a thorn The whip is constantly smashing the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "taste" is painful and numb, as if it originated from the depths of the brain, making it impossible to resist, only shivering, and the knees are soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein almost fell, busy holding the small table, sat down, twitching in front of the forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...this is an extraordinary ability... Ordinary people may think that they are just the mental problem caused by their own tension and the opposite interrogation of the interrogators, but Klein is clear Clearly recognize that this is an extraordinary ability to directly attack the extraordinary ability of others' spirit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is busy recalling the information he has seen before and quickly confirms the object of doubt:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arbitration Sequence 7 of the "People" Route, "Interrogator"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to the special department of the military? Klein thought with a little relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as it’s not the night, everything is fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You identify these photos and find the ambassador who met with Mersor." The indifferent black man will make seven or eight black and white photos. Spread out on the small table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein feels that the current whip in the spirit seems to be lifting high, and the extreme pain notice makes him afraid or willing to lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Klein didn’t need to lie at all. After a little identification, he went to the trial and officially launched a photo. It’s the dress that is gorgeous and exaggerated. Very tasteful middle-aged gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interrogator glanced at it and said nothing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Is the confession true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is as awake and rational as he was forced into a dream, without succumbing to the "whip" in the spirit, sincerely Answer: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interrogator leaned forward and held his hands small Desk: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When was the last time you saw Ian Wright?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yesterday, yesterday morning." Klein said with difficulty, and his forehead pulled out a drop of cold sweat. "I followed Mersor and found the body of the detective Zerrell, because I didn't want to deal with the policemen, Ian identified it. After the body, he was asked to call the police himself. Zerrell’s body was in the sewer entrance at the bottom of the Iron Street in the Eastern District.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
