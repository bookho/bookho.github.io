			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the "fool" is the beginning of the tarot card, then the "world" is the end, indicating perfection and sublimation, and Klein named his trumpet as " The world is to hope that there is a good meaning of one end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a lot of things that I can’t say and mention, I can make the "world" work for you, which will greatly reduce the possibility of the collapse of the "fool" image. There is a vest, no, a life with a trumpet is a complete life! Klein comfortably applauded and waved the "world" to disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he spread spirituality, wrapped himself, fell into the fog, and returned to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——He left Rosago’s "Eye of All Black" on the fog, and he couldn’t use this item anyway. "You have to worry about being discovered or lost." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packing up the material for the summoning ceremony, Klein looked up at the curtains that revealed the blushing moon, and looked forward to the party of tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the understanding of the nobility, he believes that "Justice" can definitely win over 99% of the Lunes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the small "world", he can directly ask the other party about the Pound family, and don't worry about affecting the image of "fool"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this has to be euphemistic. After all, Sherlock Morrisoni is also looking for information about the Pound family, and with enough information. Divination above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein thought for a while and relaxed to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After going over the fog, the effect of the evil spirits seems to have disappeared completely, and Klein sleeps until dawn, but does not see the sun. Because the outside is filled with thin mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to run the rest of the public library in Beckland according to the scheduled plan, but no longer asked the administrator, no longer mention the "Pound family", just Read through the information about the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 2:40 in the afternoon, Klein entered the mysterious space above the fog ahead of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancient palace, he sat in the position of "fool", and he again showed the "world" of the dummy in the mottled patina. Familiar with the sense of operation. After a few minutes, Klein took a look at the pocket watch and passed the idea of ​​a deep red star symbolizing the "Sun" class to the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he waited, he played the "black eye", "fitted" a silver chain, and wrapped it on his right wrist, using clothing. Cover the cuffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At three o'clock in the afternoon, the radiance of the road was in the palace of the giant's residence, and "justice", "downside down" and "sun" were projected respectively. Dyed with a fuzzy figure of micro red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Mr. Fool~ afternoon..." Audrey is about to say hello to every member of the Tarot Club, and the line of sight suddenly sweeps to the very end. That figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a stranger with a hooded black robe, and he’s equally illusory and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is?" Audrey was somewhat puzzled and delighted to look at Mr. "The Fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tarot will grow and grow again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Fols, or Hugh, no, no height, or someone else? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ao Lili thoughts, and Klein leaned back and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is The new member, Mr. 'World'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he discovered the surface of the astrology of the "Sun" classmates through the fog-growth The color is a bit more pure, but it has not reached the level of sequence 8. It is preliminarily judged that the other party should thoroughly digest the "singer" potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello." "Justice" Audrey greeted politely and curiously examined the new member. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly "read" the corresponding information from the details of the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. "World" is a man with emotional restraint, few physical movements, and always has a face... I don’t know where he is from, Lun, Inti Sis? Or a mysterious place like the city of silver? Audrey looked down thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- After a gathering, she judged from the phenomenon that the "sun" mouth could not match his words, that is, the other party said It is probably not Lun, and the chances of hearing the contents of the ear by himself and others are from the translation of Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "downside down" Alger, "Sun" Dairik and the "world" respectively summoned, and the new members are quite cold After responding, Klein looked to "justice": <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two candidates you proposed are still under examination."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will give you a simple task, you entrust them to you in your name, this is part of the examination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be so strict... Audrey not only does not feel disappointed, but takes it for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Tarot Club must be strictly selected, not everyone can be! She thought with pride, and immediately added some guilty silence: and I was able to be pulled in by the "fool" at the beginning, indicating that I am lucky enough, and luck is one of the qualities! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, please enact the task." Audrey made a positive response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stretched out his right hand and pressed it onto the table, showing a picture depicting Llanus's looks and dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the news of the people on the painting, he was in Beckland." Klein let the portrait flash in front of Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey looked at him and saw a young man with a black hair neatly combed, showing his full forehead and wearing round glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a colorful oil painting, the brown eyes that are ridiculously ridiculous are very prominent, and the underside is also marked with the name "Larousus "etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple task, which means that the goal is not strong... However, to let Mr. "fool" know his existence, he must have a special place... Although it is a simple task, there may still be a deeper purpose behind Mr. "The Fool"... The big man of his personality should not be just examined... Audrey was so imaginary that it took a few seconds to say: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will entrust them to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well...the two ladies are in Baker Rand seems to have a lot of networks, which is a great help for finding Llanus... Klein, who has confirmed the revenge, has returned to silence and deliberately let the trumpet perform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“World” looks around in a circle, hoarse and whispering: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mr. I can issue tasks and collect materials here, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." "Justice" Audrey elegantly bowed, "But you must Wait patiently, and then belong to the reading time of Mr. 'Footer'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I completed the task of "Assassinating Ambassador Inske Becker" and did not preemptively Occupy this time... She thought about it in her chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss justice", you have a strong sense of ownership... Waiting for me to give some knowledge, let the task of assassinating Bakerlang really close... Klein I laughed back and looked at the "hanging man." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted Man" Alger Wilson, because of a new member, did not blindly speak, kept silent, and secretly observed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, see Mr. "fool" looking at him, he humbly and rudely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is still six pages, the last page will be given to you next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Klein sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
