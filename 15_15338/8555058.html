			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday morning, Klein had just finished using breakfast and heard the expected doorbell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what surprised him was that not only Mike Joseph, but also Dr. Allen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock, I did that nightmare again last night, I think this is not normal." Allen did not avoid Mike, just entered the living room and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Klein’s answer, he took care of himself and took out a wallet:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you say it will be its problem?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since I found it out, I took it with me and started to have a nightmare. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't care to look at it, his expression suddenly solidified, if he had ever been a "clown", he had a strong control over his facial muscles. He may even reveal an unspeakable smile in front of reporters and doctors, yes, smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, this thousand paper cranes are more ugly than I am... ...this is the idea that Klein instantly produces.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he has a strong cover and a sigh of impulse:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the tradition of the same night, the manual work is relatively poor?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the thousand paper cranes in front of him are Once again, the product of the packet loss, after getting accurate information from Klein, the night-timers did not seem to delay, and sneaked into Dr. Allen’s bedroom that night, and exchanged the one in the wallet with his own folding paper crane.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what they don’t think is that the one in the wallet is also fake, and Klein is folded over the fog. It’s rough.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inexplicable and somewhat gratifying... Klein glanced at Dr. Allen, who had no sense of it, clearing his throat:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, I suggest you go to the church again, talk to the former bishop, we must believe that the gods of our faith are always watching me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, he drew a triangular emblem on his chest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last night After the "nightmare" left, Klein went to the fog, and the divination was not dangerous. It was safe and inspiring, so he can now make such suggestions with great interest. I teased my former colleagues.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thousand paper cranes that saw themselves not getting too good were back in their hands, I don’t know what kind of mood they would have... Klein took a serious relief from Dr. Allen and turned to smile at the reporter: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mike, in fact, I most want to suggest that Allen is going to see one. See a psychiatrist, but faith can certainly appease his heart. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not at all frank. Mike laughed. "Okay, we should leave." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Klein accompanied the reporter of the Daily Observer to enter the Eastern District and interviewed the girls who were rescued.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of a full £1 interview fee, no one refused, even if some of the girls who had been devastated were the same.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In this interview, Ka Ping’s sin is a key point, and the current situation of the girls is another focus, the former is irritating and the latter is heavy.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yuanxi is actually a lucky one. When you go home, you can get into work immediately. In exchange for your own labor, you can get no more than one-third of the rescued people like her, and most of them belong to the family. Some of the savings, their situation allows them to be physically and mentally traumatized, they don’t have to be busy for the time being, and they can patiently find the right job.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two-thirds are The rescuers have to run around in order to survive the massive unemployment of textile women workers. It is often only possible to find some temporary low-paying jobs. Those whose parents, brothers and sisters have never lost their jobs, are at least able to help each other, barely fill their stomachs, and the part of the family that is not so optimistic has already stepped into the street. The girl’s path seems to have never been saved. They sell their bodies once, maybe just for some food.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Mike become as silent as the last time, until he left the Eastern District when it was dark, he only came back and thanked Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock, Thanks to your help, otherwise I will be blackmailed by those gangsters today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not the purpose of hiring me?" Klein does not have any Politely and politely smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the previous embarrassment, the old Kohler and Liv family did not disclose his free help to find people, especially Daisy, quite smart, asked Mike at When you know something special, answer "Mr. Reporter and Mr. Detective" directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike's inertia nodded and walked silently for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the carriage, he suddenly vomited:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to be here The report called for the government to take out Kaping’s real estate, set up a bailout fund, use the annual income to help these rescued girls steadily, help other people who have been harmed by Kaplan, and give them a chance to break free from the current situation. Difficulties.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although Kapyeong’s safe has been looted by the Grand Theft Auto, his biggest fortune in buying real estate, these should be Illegal income. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened carefully and glanced at Mike, and praised him with sincerity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the best journalist I have ever met. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There are still many journalists like me. There are always idealists in the world. Mike exclaimed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished paying £10 for Klein and took off his hat and waved.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the reporter was on the rental carriage, Klein was going to take the public transportation in another direction. At this time, Mike suddenly opened the window and smiled and asked:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock, the reporter you know will not only have me one? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein snorted, hehe laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You guess. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of Silver.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derico.Ber is like a beast trapped inside, a little anxiously squatting back and forth in the room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He felt that the "chief" did not pay enough attention to his report, and worried that the members of the exploration team who did not know what had been affected by the "fallen creator" would have extended 2,568 to the darkness in this darkness. The city of the year caused devastating damage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a situation, he was eager to get advice and got a good understanding of the "falling creator" Miss "Justice" their opinions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the one he most expects from the Tarot party.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; &nbsp; Wait a second, wait a little longer, if Mr. Fool is not called, I will pray directly to him... Dairik tries to calm himself down, but the pace is not There was a slight delay.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw the infinite fog and heard the voice of the savior:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare for the party. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek Hoddy breathed a sigh of relief, sitting more cautiously on the edge of the bed, lying down, pretending to be ready to sleep for a while.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent number is a thousand times of heartbeat, and he waits for a while before being swallowed up by the illusory crimson rays.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At this moment, Dairik’s room was very quiet, and the lightning flashes across the sky and the darkness moved away from the land.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly In the corner of his bed, the black creeps and stretches into a human form!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
