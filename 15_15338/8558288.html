			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of paper cranes, Klein still remembers it, because the original "Destiny Snake" of Will. Positioned Dr. Allen's astral body, in his dreams when he traveled to the spiritual world, instilled information into him, formed a revelation, and evolved into a specific dream. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, Klein replaced Will, Anthony, with his own folding paper crane, and made divination on the fog, failing to be effective. In conclusion, until Dr. Allen's wife was pregnant, he guessed that it was swallowing and restarting Will. And it was guessing that the other person was working with other "destiny" through the calculation of time and the fuzzy understanding of sequence 1 to sequence 0. The snake "has a fierce battle in the sequence 0 position, and the nightmare brought by the thousand paper cranes is only attached. The real role is to help Will Anthony become a baby in a secret way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best thing about this thing is that Klein’s thousand paper cranes were used by Beckland’s value nights as the original version of Will. , with one of their more rough hand-forged ones, replaced the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will. Onsetin has always been thrown on the fog by me, almost forgot... Divination with it can only get very vague revelation, If there is no other experience, it is difficult to deduce that the child of Dr. Allen’s wife is Will Anthony, but in turn, Will Ansett can use it to determine the position of the spiritual world, just like a mirror. Arrods relied on the smell of fog, connected to the radio ticker from the spiritual world...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it seems that there is some possibility... Klein slammed straight and had a very creative idea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to take advantage of the thousand paper cranes and Will. Communication!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may not be useful to me now, even hidden there is a certain danger, but if Will Ansett is really a life school "The Snake of Destiny", I will provide the corresponding information for a certain good feeling... For the existence of this king of angels, it is necessary to invest in advance, wait for him to be true. Born, maybe there are dozens of times of return, anyway, try and not die, the amount, death can also be resurrected... Klein thought so, but the actual is very cautious, he intends to go to the fog above the divination danger Degree, and then decide whether or not to put it into practice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After some busy work, he determined that the danger of this matter is acceptable, so use the ceremony to put that Thousands of paper cranes brought back the real world from the fog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it is from the sequence 1 "The Snake of Destiny", this thousand paper cranes are not because Waiting for too long on the fog, showing what is unique, still ordinary, ordinary.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that the breath above the fog does not neutralize It's special, otherwise Will. Anthony will not be positioned, um... The sequence in front of 'The Snake of Destiny' is 'Prophet', and what I will do next will be in Will. What is Ting's expected? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He chose Dr. Allen as his father because Dr. Allen is my friend, can you connect with me? Is this too? Narcissism...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, there is a question to be doubtful, Will Anthony uses the paper crane to locate Dr. Allen and directly reinvents 'On the line, why do you want him to do nightmares again and again, and that dream also shows the battle between 'the snake of destiny', for an ordinary person, neither understand nor play a role in this matter. Isn't this seduce the blind with your eyes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will the dream created by Will. The show is shown to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein's brows were slightly wrinkled and there was some speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed the doubts, picked up the round pen, sucked the ink, and thought about leaving a sentence on the paper crane to cause Will. Ting's attention to this "snake of destiny". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you writing? Klein considers the life school encounter described by Arrods and feels that there is a sentence that can cover everything, is very clear, and contains rich feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words are:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your home is fried!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is too vulgar and too straightforward, not polite, and Will Ansettin may not be the Speaker of the Life School... Klein pondered, slightly showing a thousand paper cranes, Write different words on each surface to form a short sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Klein put a pen and put a thousand paper cranes into his wallet, just like Dr. Allen did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The edge of the sea, the one that deviates from the position of the main channel is covered by fog On the giant island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a scream of screaming, the blue raptor as if the shadow was falling from the sky, fell heavily on the ground, fell into the mud, and fluttered in the blood. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger Wilson did not care, standing in the distance, raised his left hand, the black iron ring worn with his thumb, aimed at the blue shadow Terrible extraordinary creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the ring has a spiked bulge that is stained with old blood, old and sinister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the magical item he bought from the "artisan" with the "Steel" Maviti bounty, claiming 5,200 pounds, and actually only spent 3,100 pounds. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of this ring is "spiritual whip", which can cause great uncontrollable mental damage to the enemy, but only strengthens Al Jay masters all kinds of weapons, so the actual is not so expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, "craftsman" and his friends, there were two magical items, one is "spiritual whip" and the other is "the ring of witchcraft". The latter has many abilities, adaptability, and the price is similar to the former. It is a better choice, but after considering it seriously, Alger chose the "spiritual whip". He believes that without this item, hunting blue shadow The matter will be several times more difficult, because it is an extraordinary creature that can fly, and the facts prove his judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, Alger is willing to bear the headache of the moment, can not wait to hit the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a few minutes, seeing the blue shadow floating on the body, and condensing six crystal feathers in the wings, Alger breathed a sigh of relief and walked over. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is tied with a linen strip on his forehead, with a blood-red jewel in it, and the light that shines out is like Yuehua. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the vampire baron legacy that should have belonged to Emlin White, but Alger did not rush to complete the transaction after he arrived, but with the help of it. Characteristics, added insurance to the action of hunting blue shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, the intermediary is quite good... Alger picked up the six crystal feathers and silently sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He straightens his body and looks at the towering peaks of the central island and the dense jungles around him, feeling that there are so many unspeakable dangers hidden there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My current strength is not enough to explore here... Alger retracts his sight and goes to the edge of the island, always paying attention to whether there are other "hunters" around. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, he jumped into the sea and used the "voyager" ability to easily swim to the distance, his ghost ship was parked there, his sailors still Sleeping in the effects of blood anesthesia gas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——To come to this pristine island, the ship must deviate from the main channel and sail for at least six hours, surrounded by the sea monster’s lurking storm. There is a danger of sinking, and only a navigator familiar with the route has the means to drive the boat to the vicinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late at night, Klein, who took a day off, put down the newspaper and drilled in The bed was taken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was about to fall asleep, he suddenly thought of a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz returned to the "Golden Dream" number, would it be too wasteful for me to live in such a large suite? Klein nodded invisibly and decided to leave the room and change to a hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making up his mind, he quickly fell asleep and suddenly became awake in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that he has the power to invade his dreams! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
