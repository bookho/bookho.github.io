			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Lun soldier Longzel who stayed at the entrance to the cave. Edward’s body just swayed and saw a huge figure descending from the sky and falling around On the huge rock with thick ice, the wings that covered the membrane did not close up and continued to expand, almost covering the surrounding light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ice crystal condensed dreamy piece, extremely violent blue dragon eye, the first time it is reflected in Longzel’s eyes, let him instinct When I noticed the danger, I immediately took the iron black straight sword and jumped out to the side, and even rolled the belt away from the original standing position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, the "King of the North" Yurisian, the frosty dragon opened his mouth and spit out a distorted, quiet and glaring ice blue at the cave. The color of the flame, where it passes, the void is transparent, all condensed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the moment, the ice blue flame set off a wave of dreamy light, madly pouring into the black secluded cave, everything will be along the way, all the ice . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Klein’s mind is still flashing the words “Utopia Angel, Adam”, it is not autonomously reminiscent of Russell’s description of the Twilight Hermit - "The purpose is to resurrect the original creator, the high-ranking person with the 'audience' approach, or even the 'uniqueness'. The way to convene members is through a real dream that connects the two sides of the mainland, and as long as the name itself is mentioned It can be detected immediately, but it is still instinctive to respond to the advent of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fluttered to the rugged terrain of the cave, trying to block the next attack with the rock in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the raging ice blue light is like a wave, drowning every place, freezing everything, in the cavernous environment of this cave, there is no Leave a safe area for the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the surrounding is about to become a hail, a huge gray-blue figure appeared in Kline’s sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant Grosser is silently at the forefront, kneeling down on his left knee, buried in front of his back, inserting a broad and straight sword In front of me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dawn-like light illuminates and casts an illusory wall around Grosseel, protecting everyone behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice-blue "tidal water" rushed in, first separated by a vertical sword, and then hit the dawn light on both sides! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vision of Klein et al., the cave was darkened and then restored to a small half-light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can clearly see that the fire has been extinguished, and the faint light from the outside penetrates through a layer of ice crystals, which is extremely dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, in front of Grossel, every inch of space is frozen, and the giant seems to be a bug in amber! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the giant sword that was inserted into the ground burst into a glory of morning light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They meet together, enveloped Grosell, and immediately turned into a storm of light, swept out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent, the ice layer has a huge gap like a burning melt, which has spread to the outside of the cave, and Grossel’s gray-blue figure disappears. In the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hair of the elf singer Shatas, who is still in the future, is carrying his own bow and arrow, and surrounded by the raging wind, a little buffer is rushed out. In the cave, Mobart Soloyas, the Viscount of the Solomon Empire, wearing an asymmetrical black coat, muttered "Don't worry," "I finally came," and strode, followed by Shattrath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monk facing the rock wall, Snoman, stood up and clicked on the chest as if he had painted something like a cross: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May the Lord be blessed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the voice of deaf and dumb, he stepped on his bare feet The cold ice layer ran through the crack and ran outside the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein also did not hesitate, did not pull the revolver, with his palms empty, and with the "death short teeth" Anderson, quickly entered the ice gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina Edwards, wearing a complex shirt, looks at the tremors of Daniz in the breath of the high-ranking, soft voice but no feelings Said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You stay here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, her pale blue eyes swelled deep, and the surrounding winds whistled around the wind and pushed She flew outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave here...Danizi squatted for two seconds, subconsciously circling around, saw the hoarfrost rock wall and the extinguished fire . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cave is quiet and silent, only he exists alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz's body trembles a little bit, his mouth opened, but he said nothing, only watching the captain's figure disappear into the entrance of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the cave, the former Lun soldier Longzel, who shunned the first round of attack, saw the "King of the North" Yurisian It is necessary to vacate and set aside distance with yourself and other extraordinary people to ensure their own safety, to stabilize their body shape and to push the left palm obliquely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he declared in ancient Hermes: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No flight here!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, the frosty dragon's sky-like wings seem to hang ten times the intangibles of its weight, and the fan becomes extremely difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "King of the North" immediately gave an angry groan, and a huge sound wave plunged into Longzer's ear, causing him to shake involuntarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the voice of the call, the sky-like wings finally fanned down, and all the snow and frost around them were picked up and sprinkled into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urisian, although difficult, still succeeded in flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the "Discipline Knight" Longzel expression became extremely solemn, and the sentence of the ancient Hermes word was again pronounced in the mouth:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The offender is being punished!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, his figure bounced, actually more than frost The dragon's high-flying Yurisian is also going to be fast, as if it has gained the enhancement of unknown power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longzel expanded his body in the air and waved his iron-black straight sword, squatting in the neck of the "King of the North" with a certain hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that place, the piece of ice-like nails showed obvious cracks and spread a little around, but this did not cause Ulysian to be bleeding. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This frost dragon may not even feel the pain, and the blue eyes are locked in Longzel, and the look is cruel and tyrannical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It immediately lifted the front paws, and Longzel was in the air and had nowhere to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crucial moment, a hurricane blew, and the hard-working "practicing knight" wearing black armor was pushed open, Yurisian’s slap in The void made a blast-like sound and failed to hit the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singer Sharjah just rushed out of the cave and did not hesitate to save Longzeer’s life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, her hair opened again in violation of nature, rooted in invention, entangled with electric light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She used the arrow to aim at the "King of the North", a huge slow-moving target in the air, and firmly pulled the bowstring backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s getting dark in the air, as if there are dark clouds in the air, and there is electric light jumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the influence of the "disciplined knight", the flight movement is not so smooth, Ulysses suddenly converges on the wings, swoops down, like a high-speed train slamming into the summer tower wire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the gray-blue figure of the stable figure grabbed the past and blocked the dive route of the "King of the North"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant Grosser once again touched the ground with one knee, and inserted the broad sword that humans could not use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning light shines, erecting an invisible invisible wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
