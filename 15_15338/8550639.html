			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein clicked on the head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, but I still don't know my What exactly is the mission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A non-hazardous task, at least for now, there is no sign of danger." Dunn first emphasized the point and then said, " This is a case transferred from the Jintongtong District Police Station. The famous philanthropist Sir Deville was strangely harassed for a month, but neither his bodyguard, the security guard hired, nor the police could find the criminal. The Tolre Inspector of the matter was highly suspicious of the extraordinary power and was submitted to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw Sir Deville in the library before and found that he was very emotional Poor, mentally weak, it turned out to be harassed... Klein frowned slightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of harassment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter has not yet caused substantial harm, and it is indeed not dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir Deville hears crying and groaning every night, no matter where he sleeps, whether he is not in Tingen, which makes his sleep quality very poor "Dun turned over the information at hand." He went to see the psychiatrist and asked the housekeeper and servant around him to confirm that it was not an illusion, so he was suspected of harassment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the file, Dunn looked up at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go to the lounge to put on your trainee inspector costume, to the shooting club hall and When the Tolre Inspector meets, he will tell you more detailed information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apprentice inspector clothing?" Klein subconsciously asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean squinted his forehead and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have half of the salary paid by the police The hall pays, the name of the trainee inspector is not only in the file. When you first saw me and Leonard, we also wore uniforms, which is the welfare of every official member, um, Rose. The kind of welfare that the great emperor said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, you can't wear it at ordinary times, otherwise you can change a lot of clothes... Klein took a cane and said goodbye. Exited the captain's office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to the diagonally opposite lounge and saw a set of black-and-white uniforms including leather boots, with a soft hat inlaid with "double swords crossed, The coat of arms with the crown of the crown, the shoulders are black and white staggered as a base, a silver star shining badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the trainee inspector?" Klein glanced at it and found a string of inconspicuous numbers under the silver star of the badge: "06-254." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a preliminary understanding of the classification of police in the Kingdom of Lun, knowing that at the top are the Minister of Police and the Chief Police Secretary, under which are the various police departments. Director, Deputy Director, Assistant Director, at the middle level are the Superintendent and the Inspector, and at the bottom are the Sergeant and the Police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the door, Klein took off his formal attire, took off his hat, and put on the uniform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang the original clothes, he pushed the door out, entered the office of the civilian staff, and took the full-length mirror that Rosanne won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man in the mirror is shaking, brown and gentle, and a uniform makes him a bit more heroic than usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not bad." Klein was pleasing in a pleasing manner, leaving his cane in the office and turned to get out of Blackthorn Security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his pocket, the police officer’s card is the same as the full-size weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall of the shooting club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw the Into Inspector because he was the only person in the police uniform here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I have to add me now... Klein silently added one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructor of Tolre has two silver stars, his clothes are propped up by his stomach, his face is covered with thick brown beards, and his body is tall but not powerful. Or once violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Morety Klein Moretti?" Tolle looked up and down and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Tolre Inspector, I think you should not admit the wrong person." Klein replied wittyly, and according to the impression, raised his right hand, closed the five fingers, OK A gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tole laughs and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be seen that you are a young person who is easy to get along with. People, so I am relieved, we are going to the home of Sir Deville now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his police level is higher than Klein, but in his tone There is an obvious questioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem." Klein thought about it. "You can tell me the details in the carriage."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Tolle touched the thick brown beard and led Klein out of the shooting club and onto a carriage parked opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage has a coat of arms with a "double sword cross and a crown of crowns", which is controlled by a dedicated driver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sir Deville is a believer in the goddess, so we transferred the case to you." Tolle just sat down and couldn't wait to confess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that jazz is a frequent visitor to newspaper content and magazine covers." Klein smiled softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tole picked up the paper bag next to it, untied the entanglement, extracted the information, and said, turning over:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I will give you a detailed introduction, no matter if you understand it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir Deville is the richest man in the city of Tingen. His career began with lead-making factories and porcelain factories, and now he has been in steel, coal, shipping, banking and securities. He is also a great philanthropist praised by the king, establishing the Deville Charity Fund, Deville Trust, Deville Library... He was awarded the title of the Lord five years ago... If he is willing to run for the mayor, I don’t think anyone in Tingen will be his opponent.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, his goal is in Beckland, he wants to be a member of the House of Lords. We once suspected that he was harassed about this matter, but could not find any clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gently sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not rule out this Yes, but I can't be sure about anything now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teller did not entangle the problem too much and continued:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the 6th of last month, when Deville slumbers every night, he will hear the numbness of the scalp, like a dying patient struggling, he checked the surrounding The room did not find any abnormal conditions, and the housekeeper and the servants also confirmed that there was a similar sound, but the movement they heard was very slight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “In the beginning, Sir Deville thought that things would soon pass, and they didn’t care too much, but the painful sputum became more frequent, even during the day, and there was more heart-twitching crying.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This made Sir Deville insomnia again and again, had to leave Tingen and go to the villa in the country, but it had no effect, and he and the crying still entangled him. Similarly, even if he went to Beckland, things did not subsidize, only Relatively less serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He asked security personnel to check around, no clues were found, and our preliminary investigations also lacked gains."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This more than a month of torture has brought the spirit of Sir Deville close to collapse. He has been looking for a psychiatrist again and again, but he still can’t get rid of it. He told us that if the problem is He couldn't solve it this week. He moved to Tingen and went to Beckland. He believed that someone would help him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Toller's description, Klein quickly analyzed the possibilities: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offended Which extraordinary person has cursed?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, if it is a curse, the housekeeper and the servant cannot hear the same sound...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servant and the bodyguard have hidden an extraordinary person who does not know what purpose?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that in the past month or so, no one has asked Mr. Deville...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps Sir Deville accidentally got rid of the evil spirits This kind of "dirty thing"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not rule out this reason...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s thoughts are mixed, the carriage enters the Golden Sycamore area, Stopped at the door of Sir Deville. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a prosperous garden surrounded by iron railings, there are two empty statues of iron gates, there are springs that constantly spout, bathing marble statues, and occupying the ground. Actively wide two-story houses with enough roads for three carriages in parallel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Jazz has only two floors... The newspaper said that Beckland is trying to build a ten-story apartment..." Kline walked down the carriage. I saw a three-V police officer with an epaulette and hurried over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Klein and raised his hand to the ceremony:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, sir! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning." Klein smiled and daggered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tole laughed aside:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Sheriff Gate, what do you have? Things can be told to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the inspector of the inspector Moretti, the history expert of the county police department, psychologist." Gate introduced a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......I can’t afford it... Klein was ashamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the chill is finished, Gate points to the second floor of the house behind the fountain:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deville The jazz is waiting for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein reached out and touched the revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his greatest reliance on the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Because of changing the police uniform, he can put the gun bag on the waist side in a bright and straight manner, which is easy to extract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, a group of three people walked along the wide road, bypassing the fountain and coming outside the main entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, a servant opened the door and waited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has not yet had the opportunity to enter the house, pretending to organize the hat, pinching his eyebrows and opening the "Lingshi". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bright living room, the square face of Sir Devil is licking his forehead, the spirit is quite poor, his dark gold hair and blue eyes are dry or dull The whole person seems to be five years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, jazz." Kline, Tolle, and Gate also politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Deville got up and barely smiled and responded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, three police officers I hope that you can solve my troubles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Klein rubbed his eyes and his brows were slightly wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the mentality is poor, he did not find any problems with Sir Deville. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very weird...He thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jazz, you are the earliest In which room did you hear you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My bedroom." Sir Deville shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can we go and have a look?" Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you not checking it a few times?" The middle-aged housekeeper next to him frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, he did not recognize Klein as a companion of a good-hearted person who "does not pick up money." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
