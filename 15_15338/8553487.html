The reptiles walked forward and drilled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the picture flashed, he did not know where to pick up a black iron badge, worn on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the badge is engraved with a scepter and a hand holding the scepter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"图铎!" Klein suddenly woke up from the dream and sat up straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the introduction of the bodyguard, the black iron badge is engraved with the royal coat of arms of the Quaternary Empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly the same as what he saw in that ancient building! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rift Pound is not as simple as it was before..." Kline snorted his forehead and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a "divinationist", he has his own interpretation of the revelations he saw in his dreams. On the one hand, he knows that it is the Raft Pound. In the future, on the other hand, he believes that this shows that Raft Pound itself has a deep connection with the Tujia family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a positive inquiry, a "dream into" exploration, and a "psychic" exchange, the three tests of Raft Pound did not reveal any problems, nor did you let me I noticed the slightest abnormality. If I didn't leave a hand, I was afraid that he would be deceived by the past. Um... Maybe, maybe he really didn't know anything now. It was just a true performance. When the future, I happened to meet the opportunity. It has a connection with the Tujia family...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the bigger possibility is that he has learned a lot from the old viscount and deliberately degraded before he was sure. It’s a kind of extraordinary ability to play a role, the amount... He shouldn’t be acting at the time, he’s really in a state of paralysis, otherwise he’s already in a similar situation. I have a lot of experience in front of me...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the extraordinary ability? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a sequence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the kind that has a certain extraordinary ability? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought all the way down, feeling that he had entered a dead end, was busy pulling out, changed his angle, silently said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rift Pound has a deep connection with the Tudor family..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you be bold? Assume that he is actually a descendant of the Tujia family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If his blood relationship with the old viscount is real, then things are interesting." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The whole Pound family is a member of the family that has changed its name to escape the pursuit of killing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "They built merits, won the title, and returned to the center of the rights step by step. At the same time, they secretly searched for the secret remains of the Tudor Empire that remained in Beckland."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how many years have passed, they finally got the harvest, so they bought the house that belongs to Miller Carter and built an exaggerated basement to explore The area around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirty or forty years ago, they found the ruins and repaired a secret door leading to it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, in the process of exploring the ruins, there was an accident. The evil spirit did not recognize the descendants of the so-called Tulu family. The two heirs of the old viscount died in the innermost side. That room, even the extraordinary features and magical items were not rescued."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the old Viscount spent a huge price to buy similar extraordinary features, let the two The death of the heir seems more normal, but the continuous violentness is still somewhat suspicious in the eyes of the royal family and the church. Therefore, after the death of the old prince, Raft Pound deliberately exaggerated and distorted the investigation in the dark, and made himself scared. 'Having a psychological problem, starting to indulge in wine and gambling to avoid attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can explain something that I was very confused before. The family of the Viscounts is controlled by mysterious people who don't know where to come from. When the royal family and the church are embarrassed? Even if you want to control, you will use it more softly and will not be The way to detect, for example, the sequence of my route 6 'no face'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A child can detect abnormalities, not to mention the royal family and the three churches. Strong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reason why they don't know, the only explanation is that those people are sent by them."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... I guessed that the Tulu family and the Terencer family were also in the 'black emperor' route, so based on the needs of the play, the dynasty they built would retain the Solomon Empire. The style and characteristics of this, the bodyguard lady seems to have confirmed the side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sequence of the 'Black Emperor' route 9 is the 'lawyer', is a very An extraordinary profession that is good at using order, the amount... Raft Pound deceived 'dreaming And the ability of 'Psychic' comes from this, or even further? He fully cooperates with me, but in the state of dreams and embarrassment, he still subconsciously exploits the loopholes of order and let the results develop in the direction he hopes." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think carefully, in the process of 'Psychic', Raft Pound seems to have no lie, but the truth is only partial truth. Words... Maintaining the family, bearing in mind the glory, can refer to the Pound family, but also to the family of the figure..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s ideas become clearer, Have a holistic judgment on things:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the current attitude of Raft Pound, there is no way for the evil spirits without external help. Get out of trouble, otherwise the baron should have tried to save himself, no matter whether the evil spirits will come to him, as long as the other side escapes from the seal and creates a disaster, the underground relics will not be able to escape the royal family and the church. Raft is bound to be implicated... the opposite room collapses without affecting the bundle The power of the evil spirits means that as long as the room on the innermost side is not directly damaged, the evil spirits cannot escape the trouble...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well...the plan is very clear Find Casper to buy some explosives, collapse the entrance, let no one get in, let the evil spirit be buried underground forever, oh, when I have enough strength, I can consider solving it, help The people of Beckland completely removed this hidden danger and harvested some valuable items by the way...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, how to blast is the safest? I don't understand at all... Maybe, which blasting expert does Casper know? After all, he is a black market weapon trader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quickly finalized the plan and decided to go to Casper tomorrow evening to try to solve the underground relics completely this week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the true relationship between the Pound family and the Tudor family, as for the abnormality of Raft Pound, he did not want to go into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Off my ass!" Klein muttered, quickly falling into the fog and returning to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday morning, Klein still goes out early and is very busy . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual situation is that he once again came to the Cragg club, practice shooting, read the newspaper, and lived quite comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon tea, he was already mixing here for a day and he was ready to leave, but he accidentally saw Mary Gayle, the former employer and Tallim. Dumont, the equestrian teacher, enters the club at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With them, there are many gentlemen wearing double-breasted long dresses and beautiful ladies with beautiful dresses, including the Daily Observer. Reporter, Mike Joseph. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, detective Moriarty, it’s a coincidence." Mike, who has a fascinating eye but a rather rough skin, greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein replied with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Reporter, is your survey news completed?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete, thanks to your help! I will introduce you, this is a famous big detective, Sherlock Moriatti, Tallim Good friend." Mike waved his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After both parties greeted each other, Mike continued: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I probably figure out who Kapyeong is. I will tell you in detail when I have time. In short, I have good reason to believe that Hibbel’s death stems from imitating crime, not the serial killer, haha, Tomorrow, tomorrow you will be able to see my survey news in the newspaper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the same as I guessed." Klein smiled and responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Mike seems to think of something, sideways to Mary Gayer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will have an exclusive interview with you about the air pollution situation and solutions of Beckland. However, you must communicate with the editor-in-chief of our newspaper in advance to finalize the layout and time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maryton’s eyes are bright:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Thank you so! Mike, why didn't I think of this good way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in the promotion and development of the "Kingdom Air Pollution Investigation Committee"? Mike’s reporter has a lot of experience... The Daily Observer is not the best newspaper, but the circulation is quite large... Mary suddenly came here today because of the few people who participated in the club. Members of the House of Commons are coming over? The form of a private club is really suitable for politics and business... Kline has made a false statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before becoming a "no face", he did not want to blend into this high-level affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, in an apartment in the Eastern District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a busy day, Williams enters the small room where he rents, intends to change his coat, take some notes, go to the pub to have a good meal, and by the way Solve dinner there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dark and dim environment, his movements in his coat suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a black shadow standing next to the window, his face completely obscured by the shadow of the hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who asked you to find Llanus?" The shadow asked slowly and slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams quickly put on his coat and swallowed his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a friend , bounty hunter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bounty hunter refers to the adventurer with various rewards as the main source of income. In the Eastern District, there are many in Bakerland. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did he suddenly start looking for Llanus again? This is a reward for a long time ago." The shadow was very high, step by step to Williams. In front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, maybe, she just gave a reward for a try." Williams stepped back very small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark shadow is dumb and asks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is she?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williamston was struggling, and after a few seconds he trembled and replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hugh, Hugh. Dilcah, I don't know where she lives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, very honest." The black shadow reached out and took Williams' body, no Ask again, go to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams quietly breathed a sigh of relief and thought that the rich experience of the underworld helped himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not be stubborn when you shouldn’t be forced! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he saw the black shadow snapping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams’s thoughts solidified, his body was instantly torn apart, and spread out in all directions, making the ground and the walls full of flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the black shadow broke the gas pipeline here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
