			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret diary of Russell Gustav? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell the Great? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, only this kind of thing is worthy of the attention of the "fool" Mr. level of this level... Audrey first saw it, and immediately found himself not in the slightest Feeling unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that Russell’s Emperor once saw the “Slate”, and it is said that the secret cards he made contain 22 ways of God. The high-ranking sequence is sure to care about things! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Diary? Is that a diary?" Alger frowned, keenly aware of a detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. "The Fool" said Russ Gustav's legacy as a diary in a positive tone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did he know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did he confirm? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he master the interpretation of "Russell Secrets"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the "downside down" question, Klein, who had achieved the desired effect, leaned back to the back of the chair, hands clasped, and answered with ease: < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We first treat it as a diary for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He neither denied nor did sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that Russell’s, um, diary, was written in secret words or symbols he invented himself?” Audrey listened to other noble children. I mentioned this matter, but I never really saw it. I was very curious and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Alger replied briefly. "Some people think that it is a unique set of occult symbols. Some people believe that it is a hieroglyph, but Until today, no one has found the right way to interpret it, at least in the scope I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking behind, he looks sideways at Klein I seem to want to seek some kind of affirmation, and it seems to be suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the text that has been derived for generations. It is no longer the initial pictogram. According to your thoughts, how can you interpret it... Klein’s emotions are calm and secret I laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the mysterious symbols to deal with, he immediately thought of some absurd and funny scenes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;An evil mage wearing a black hooded robes, rolled up the cuffs, revealing the symbols of the mysterious power left on the arm, said to be from the remains of Russell the Great, that is two cyan, huge Simplified Chinese characters:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Comic ratio!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's mouth is slowly upturned, feeling more and more Very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the description of "downside down", Audrey said in a dilemma:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Symbols or words that we don't understand... So how do we relay to you here, Mr. Fool? Or, send it somewhere?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is An important question... I don't have a channel to receive things secretly... Kline didn't rush to answer, the hands on the cross, the thumb separated and touched, touched and separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he found an idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I can follow my own ideas, here Create a temple, tables and chairs, can you let others directly print the content presented in their minds? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try it out...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Audrey and Alger saw the fullness of the body The foggy "fool" gentleman sat down straight:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss justice, let us try, you imagine a paragraph, and give it an urgent write Emotions, um, you pick up the pen next to it and write on the paper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She puzzled and curiously picked up the pen and, according to the instructions, imagined a poem written by Russell the Great in her mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If winter comes Will spring be far behind?" (Note 1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks through the text, picks up the pen, and gives the idea of ​​presenting them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein feels this "emotion", so the "pen" is used as a medium to guide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey just dropped the pen and saw a line of words on the parchment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If winter comes, will spring be far behind?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Goddess, this is amazing!" Audrey was surprised and full of emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she looked at Klein with some fear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Fool, you can read Out of my mind?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I am just a guide, simplifying the process of writing your words and turning it into a rubbing The way, if you don't want to go to 'expression', there will be no traces." Klein gives a soothing voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way... then we just need to remember the symbols or secrets, and we can present them directly according to our wishes?" Mouth, asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Klein replied briefly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a really good way, Miss 'Justice', don't doubt your memory, become a 'audience', you will get a great deal in this area Ascension.” Alger watched the previous attempt and only felt that the “fool” was more mysterious and powerful than he imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his own memory, he believes that with the next promotion, you can get enough growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Audrey is delighted to nod:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really a happy reminder Mr. Hangman, what do you teach me about the 'audience'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, she turned her head to look up:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool, I will work hard to complete your mission and try to collect more Secret Diaries of Russell the Great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, I am a person who likes the exchange of equivalents. The prepaid payment is only equivalent to two pages per person. If there is any extra, I will give it extra." Klein uses a kind of Said that the child’s cheap voice is not calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for where the extra compensation comes from, of course, the new Russell’s secret diary will form a good cycle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are such a generous gentleman." Alger silently for a few seconds, with his hands on his chest, slightly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ceremony, he turned to "justice":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I emphasize again, the audience is forever It’s just the audience.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I know that many viewers like to imagine that they are the protagonist or another character, and thus invest a lot of feelings, so that as the drama cries, With the laughter of the drama, with the anger of the drama, with the sadness of the drama, but this is not what your 'audience' should do.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the field of 'drama', in the face of a person who consciously or unconsciously plays a certain role, you must maintain an absolute spectator attitude. Only then can you examine them calmly and objectively. Find the movements they are used to, notice the slogans of their lying, smell their nervous taste, and grasp their true thoughts from all kinds of subtle clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Believe me, everyone will naturally secrete different 'things' because of their different emotions. The taste, but the only real 'audience' to sniff out "<br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Audrey listened carefully and her eyes became brighter:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds very, very, very interesting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein heard the first move in the first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirements of the "audience" potion summed up as if it were "to be absolutely neutral" Audience". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is equivalent to a certain degree of play...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;play? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Russell’s “play” mean this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I need to play the "Divination" to digest the potion a little bit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Klein fell into thinking, Alger explained what he knew about the "audience" and sank:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that nothing is happening?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe we can just talk about it and talk about what’s going on around you. Maybe it’s very Ordinary news can be a very important clue to others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Klein returned and bowed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already tried to play a "divination", anyway, this does not seem to have any bad influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you start with Mr. Hang Man?" Audrey agreed with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger thought for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The self-proclaimed 'Admiral Ludwell' The big pirate began to explore the eastern end of the Sunia Sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the owner of the 'Black Tulip'?" Asking questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Alger said with a dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know who it is... Klein didn’t listen to it, thinking about what he should say, neither revealing himself nor getting it. News feedback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he had the decision to maintain the high image of the "fool", the fingers of the bronze long table edge:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As far as I know, the secret will lose a note from the Antigonus family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news is not the only one The night-time people in Tingen City are mastered, the secret society, and the extraordinary people who are closely related to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notes from the Antigonus family?" Alger repeated it, shaking his head with a low smile. "I am really curious about the night goddess church knowing this news." Reaction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are you only talking about the Goddess Church? Klein was keenly aware of the problem, but it was not easy to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would undermine the mysterious and profound image of the "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Audrey was confused: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you curious about this? Goddess Is there any special reaction from the church?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tigonus family was destroyed by the Church of the Night God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Specifically the end of the Quaternary, or the beginning of the current era, I am not quite sure "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...Klein’s eyes are shrinking, and there is a sudden coolness in the body:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It seems that the night-timers pay more attention to the Antignus family notes than I imagined!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
