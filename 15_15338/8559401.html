			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge black-and-black palm is caught by the boat and climbs up quickly, pulling out the inch below the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw a large black-and-white shadow through the blue water wave, and then the crawling piece of meat occupied all the horizons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster seems to be pieced together by countless gray-black bodies. The two huge palms are withered arms like dry wood, and the arms are derived from A dead body of a suspected giant. The giant's one-eyed eyes are closed, and several other heads are attached to the neck, and those heads extend out to the scales of the fish body, lizard-like bodies, and human twisted bodies. One layer later, a floating island-shaped piece of meat was constructed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From different bodies, from the splicing gap, a yellow-green gas diffuses out and spreads around, seemingly to cover this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough! Cough and cough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only smelled a little smell, there were a lot of sailors on the deck who coughed hard and coughed almost straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Frank Lee does not hesitate to take out the material in the dark belt of the belt, and to display the extraordinary ability of the corresponding, who knows, "above the stars "The singer's voice is first heard in his ear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frank, stop!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Go help Nina to command the sailors and adjust the sails with them! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? "Frank Lee has subconsciously asked a question.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this area, the supernatural things in the 'Mother Earth' authority will change, including your ability. . Between the words of Jia De Li Ya, the palms of the two are already stretched out and pressed at a certain position on the desk.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The symbols and magic signs on the "Future" are immediately The layers are clearly illuminated, and the whole ship is turned into a sea of ​​stars. This seems to correspond one-to-one with the deep sky and light that garners around the body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The diffuse yellow-green gas is blocked by the starlight, and Klein floats from the edge to the window of his room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coughing pirates The symptoms were alleviated. Under the leadership of Mariner Nina and Duke Frank, I listened to the command of the Chief of the Sea, Ottolov, and quickly adjusted the sails in an attempt to get the "Future" out of the nearby ocean at a faster rate. It is affected by the effect of the change.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the gray-black monster has been entangled in the front part of the ship, and the underwater body is not connected to where it is. Life has dragged the "Future" and made it difficult.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, there seemed to be an invisible mountain in the surrounding area, which blocked the sea breeze from the distance, so that the “Future” could not borrow power no matter how the sails were adjusted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the face of such a situation, you need an alternate steam power system, but unfortunately, the 'Future Number' does not...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm... It can also leap through the stars, but it seems to be very expensive for the 'hidden' lady, and it is difficult to grasp the direction and progress, flying in that way in this sea, as long as it is not fortunate, a big probability to rush into The dangerous area, oh, there is Anderson's extremely unlucky guy on the boat..." Klein floated in the window of his room, looking at the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not nervous, because no matter the "star above" Jia Delia, or "the strongest hunter" Anderson, has not yet shown real strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, including me... Klein added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to go back to the cabin first, put on the "fire" gloves - there is no "food" nearby, use this magical item more than "squirming hunger" Suitably, the latter needs to have the opportunity to use it to deal with more dangerous and complicated situations, and then be thrown into the fog to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the negative effects of lost items, Klein has plans to wait for the replacement of equipment, the wallet, Aztec copper whistle, adventurer harmonica Put the items in the suitcase, leaving only the "squirming hunger", the fisherman's cuffs and the various spells in the Poseidon field, and pay close attention to the first two to prevent them from being lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not worried about this. He has made several spells with different effects. You can use one, throw one, and throw one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the metal corresponding to the storm field is tin, which is cheap and worthless. The extraordinary effect is given by the "Poseidon Scepter" without any extra money... Klein stretched out his hand and pushed open the window of his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the huge gray-black monster spliced ​​into pieces of meat climbed up a lot, and as it approached, the busy sailors on the deck Their hair grows madly and soon over the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the most terrible situation. The most amazing thing is that one of the linen hairs seems to have their own life, staggered and entangled. Bundle your own master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cluster of hair has undergone similar changes one after another, and the "Future" surface of the Xinghai Sea has not completely blocked this effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some of the shaved pirates, they are not fortunate because of their uniqueness. Their nose hairs are reproducing at a speed visible to the naked eye, blocking the passage of breathing. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain's room window, "Star above" Jia Delia does not know when he has raised his arms and has a scroll made of smooth skin . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Paralysis!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the resurgence of this ancient Hermes spell, with The silent burning of the reel, a light green brilliance from it, hit the giant palm of the monster appearing on the edge of the ship's side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no stagnation of the creeping pieces of the corpse that countless corpses, and the palm of the hand photographed the starry sea, and the waves shook and the ship shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep purple color in the eyes of Jia De Li Ya is very rich. She did not take out the new reel and pushed the right palm directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious mantra of Sakaguchi spit out from the mouth of this pirate general Her lingering stellar awns flew one after another and landed on the horrible gray monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starburst instantly condenses, creating a huge transparent amber, which wraps the creeping pieces of meat into the original position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "the strongest hunter" Anderson's right palm has more dark swords, which seem to have layers of evil patterns. But it is just an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anding the horrible monster was trapped by the "Starlight Cage", Anderson's body appeared a blazing flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire flashed forward, jumped out of the ship's side, and fell to the gray and black pieces made up of countless bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the flaming white glow swiftly swept away on the surface, as if doing the ultimate painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tengling, the fireworks skyrocketed, Anderson hand-painted the black dagger and jumped back to the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge monster still solidified there, seems to have lost all vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click, click, click! There was a deep bottomless wound on the surface of the body, which split into countless small pieces of meat in a second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reaper’s attack power is really exaggerated... Klein, who has adjusted his body, just returned to the window and saw this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his brow wrinkled invisibly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the abnormal changes suddenly occurred, and the split pieces of meat were stretched out of the hands and feet, and in an overwhelming manner, they ejected to the future. "deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This huge black attacker seems to never kill, how many pieces it cuts, how many monsters it can become! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent, the captain’s room was erected with a gray piece of meat on the deck facing it, and it went straight to the "star above". Wrap the other's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
