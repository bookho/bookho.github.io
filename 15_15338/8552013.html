			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the answer from "The Fool", Alger quietly breathed a sigh of relief, lowered his head, and said humblely:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please allow me to praise you in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I am also very curious...very curious about a sequence of 6 "Wind" believes that it is possible to have the magical items of the sequence 4 strength. What a curious general wants to do in Bakerland... Klein smiled and kept a deep and silent gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I have no promise to listen and I will help! He emphasized one sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he has more enthusiasm than before, because his real ally, the mysterious Mr. Azick is in Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is really necessary, Klein is willing to use the copper whistle and ask Azke to help. Of course, he will certainly not mention the "Tarot", only possible to blur The ground represents a source of information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this matter, there are still two problems. First, Klein and Azick are currently limited to partnerships, and the other party is not necessarily helpful. Unless the things that Zilingers wants to do, or the magical items involved, can cause the other party's interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Klein is not sure how strong Azick’s current strength is. Even if he adjusts his guess and thinks that the other party is a high-ranking strongman, he must be cautious. The situation takes into account the weakening of “amnesia”. After all, knowledge is often equal to strength, and the incomplete knowledge will definitely make the power greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, whether Azick can deal with Qilingus, who has "squirming hunger", Klein is not sure, and there are some fears Let acquaintances encounter dangers, and they are not willing to bother them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about the horror "messenger" summoned by Mr. Azick's copper whistle... No, the guy is like a messenger, playing BOSS is enough! Um, even if Mr. Azke can't win the "sweet hunger" blessing of Zilingers, he should be able to easily protect himself, and have the spare power to save the "downside down" and save the "extraordinary" Miss. ... Klein thoughtfully adjusted the sitting position, the back of the chair back state, the right leg rested on the left leg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alje looked at the "fool" and said again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am about to get a batch of Russell's diary, I believe that next time, or next meeting, will be presented to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Lord of the Storm The division of the church, Port of Pritz is under the jurisdiction of the Beckland parish, so Alger can enter the capital of the kingdom on the grounds of reporting the last voyage, waiting for the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qi Lingues to expose the possession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in history, Beckland was once the headquarters of the Church of the Storm, until the end of the last era, the Kingdom of Lun was established, they moved the altar To the island of Passo, so in any case, the Beckland parish of the Lord of the Storm is second only to the headquarters of the seven churches, and the richness of various materials can be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, it is inherently unreadable, and the Russell Diary, which is semi-publicly studied by the extraordinary members of this church, must be fairly easy to collect. Alger is very confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein deliberately brought a little pleasure to the tone, gently slamming the first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His true emotions at this time are half happy and half sad, and happy to see many pages of Russell diary soon, which may be recorded A lot of useful information, what is sad is what should be exchanged with "downside down people". After all, no one can say whether there is content in the diary that can make "inverted people" interested, or whether there is content Sufficient value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you are a "diviner", you can’t know in advance... Is it really necessary for my "deaf" to help? Klein sighed silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the end of the "downside down" and "fool" exchanges, Audrey Hall is busy asking: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timeliness... Hey, how handsome is the word "justice", compared with her, "downside down" you are too rough! Klein nodded invisibly, through the rich gray fog:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Awesome! Audrey quietly clenched her fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Klein turned to look at the silent "Sun" Dairik Berg, said softly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, 'Mr. Fool'." Dairik lowered his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palace above the fog, the scene was quiet for a few seconds, and Audrey took the initiative to speak:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need the complete pituitary of the colorful lizard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main materials of the "Reader" potion? "After hanging people" Alger seemed to nod in a slightly invisible place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't, honestly, this creature, I only saw it in textbooks." "Sun" Dairik heard the automatic translation "Phantom Yalong." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What textbooks will introduce extraordinary creatures? It’s really enviable... The similar information I got at the extraordinary party was either a direct dictation or a crumpled piece of paper, not systematic enough, and lacking in order... Then I had the opportunity to exchange him from the Sun. Textbook! Hey, he is interested in the recipe of the "Singer" sequence... Audrey thought for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Alger looked at the "fool" and took his eyes back to look at the opposite side, sinking and saying:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I may be able to get the complete pituitary gland of the colorful lizard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaiting Audrey's delight, he added: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the premise is to find Zilingers, when, plus I need to compensate for your part, just equal to the complete pituitary of the colorful lizard, 'justice' Miss, you may not know that this kind of Yalong is close to extinction. At present, only the misty sea, the violent sea, and some original islands of the Sunia Sea still have their traces. The coordinates of these islands are only very few people. Master, oh, if you are interested in the future, we can make some exchanges in this regard, because I am one of the few people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also Those original islands are interested... Klein silently listened to the communication between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the colorful lizard, the dragon subspecies is close to extinction, he suddenly recalled the joke with the old Neil - the Dragon and Giant Protection Association, The mood is bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey listened very excitedly and endured the emotions:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to I dreamed of sailing on the sea, looking for the original islands, and seeing the ancient customs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goddess, "Tarot Club" is too powerful, amazing! There are members who have some primitive island coordinates! Praise "Mr." Audrey lost her "audience" status and her lips showed a beautiful arc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original island? Klein first glimpsed, and immediately remembered a page of Russell's diary that he had seen before, which is the page of the great COS One Piece! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and his "Apocalypse Four Knights" found an unnamed island in the unsafe channel of the Misty Sea, with many extraordinary creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the so-called original island? Unfortunately, the Emperor did not leave the coordinates in the diary on that page. Well, maybe there are follow-up diaries, but until now, I have not got a continuous diary... Klein is regrettable and expecting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the "Sun" Dairik, it has been stupid by the words of the foggy sea, the violent sea, the Sunia Sea, the original island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He increasingly feels that he is not in the world with Miss "Justice" or "Down Man". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
