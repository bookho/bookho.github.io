			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no glare in the ditch, there is no light in the sewer, normal people walking here, must carry the lantern, in order to see the necessary situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for Klein of the spiritual state, this is not an obstacle, and everything around him has already been reflected in his "eyes." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when the "desire apostle" discovered him, he also discovered the "desire apostle." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the opening, without hesitation, he opened his mouth directly and made a silent scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an attack that directly hurts the soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Desire Apostle" The body that just wants to move suddenly slammed, like who gave a heavy blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow-like body surface has dropped a large piece of black, as if the snow that has the deepest desires is shaken off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, the “Apostle of Desire”, which was seriously injured, almost stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without physical support, he is like a candle in the wind, staggering, and may go out at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His shadows are scattered, turned into dark liquid, flowing in all directions, people do not know which one to chase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this moment, in the darkness behind Klein, suddenly a shadow came out and slammed into the front! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black liquids that are not considered viscous are just the props that the "desire apostle" uses to confuse attention and facilitate their own raid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein seemed to have no reaction at all, letting the shadows fall on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the "desire apostle" suddenly shuddered as if he had touched the coldest and coldest thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow quickly became slow and seemed to have been "frozen" stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the shadow of the ghost has its own frozen effect, but I did not expect that the guy wearing the dark crown can let the same spirit belong to himself. Suffered from the impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a complete personality suppression! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For such a result, Klein had expected that he turned his body halfway, extended his right hand, and pressed the head of the stiff shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the dark gold "sun brooch" covered in dark armor flashed a shimmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Desire Apostle perceives the danger, feels the coming of the end, wants to resist, but is powerless for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A clear and sacred light emerged from the air, falling on the head of the shadow, covering his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the hoar is illuminated, the black shadow struggles, but it evaporates, just blinking his eyes, he has become extremely thin, his own spirituality It is filled with the glory of the raging sun and the unwilling crazy cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't give him a chance to breathe, and summoned a pure and bright light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of whiteness lasted for two seconds, and the "desire apostle" fell to the ground and lost the breath of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body is still in a shadow state, thin as if there is no thickness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has just assassinated a Duke’s sequence of the top 5 and died like this, even the last words are too late to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Klein saw the spirit of the other side being blown away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extraordinary features have to wait for a while... Do you want to imitate Miss Sharon, possess the shadow, speed up the progress... but I don’t know that skill... Ryan considered what to do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying on spiritual intuition, he looked at the place where he had passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall, heavy silver armor flew away, with the left shoulder slanting down the area, staining large pieces of coagulated blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seal "1 - 42"... Klein was tight in his heart and wrapped the "desire apostle" spirit without hesitation, ending the call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His original intention was that even if there was no time to solve the "desire apostle", as long as an official extraordinary person arrived, he immediately "returned" and handed over the following matters. Give each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red glove that wore the blood-stained silver armor just saw a black-painted crown and a figure of the same color cloak, and found that the other party disappeared silently, leaving no Any traces below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blinked his eyes and carefully examined where the other party was, and found the "desire apostle" who lost his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Clear the clues, destroy the evidence?" He said lowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬, the red gloves behind arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning to the fog, Klein was not in a hurry to psychic Directly leave the mysterious space and enter the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He skillfully picked up ritual items such as candles and quickly removed the last trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he made the substitute again, and took four steps back to the ancient palace above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, he can communicate directly with the surviving spirit like a real "psychic", no need to pray to anyone, or even ritual assistance. One point, he has already verified it in the psychic "Master of Secrets" Rosago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that the "desire of the apostle" Beria's spirit has been purified, ready to dissipate, Klein is ready to ask for relatively more important information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the "devil" approach to the potion formula, he intends to consider it at the end, anyway, even if he gets it, he does not intend to sell it, lest he should cultivate a few cold-blooded The serial killer came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the brown-brown, empty-eyed "desire apostle", Klein spread spirituality and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you trying to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desire of the "Apostles" is completely separated by the fog and can only be answered slyly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assassination of the Duke of Nigan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke of Nigan... is he? Who wants him to die? Klein asked with a slight sigh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Successful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Success "The Desire Apostle" calmly replied, without extra mentioning anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked why he would only answer anything in this state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Duke of Nigan, the Lord of the Storm can't protect you... Klein painted a blushing moon on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not try to understand the details, asked directly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who instructs you?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the organization that commissioned the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qilingus? Klein recalled the previous assassination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Desire Apostle" tone is not wavering: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An organization, the most secretive and most The ancient organization, the vast majority of the extraordinary people do not know its existence, its members are said to have large figures in various fields, and perhaps some of the high-level members of the various churches and national military are their members."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What promises have they promised you, and you are willing to give up your business for more than a decade?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The desire apostle" voice replied slightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A plaque, 'Abyss' brand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;亵渎牌牌? The "Abyss" card of one of the twenty-two cards made by Russell! Most of this corresponds to the "demon" approach. It is no wonder that the "desire apostle" is willing to pay for all the things accumulated in the past ten years... There is hope that he will become a high sequence strong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reward is much more valuable than the mission! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, "Hurricane Lieutenant" Kiringes should not be attracted to such rewards unless, unless that organization has another one he needs The card of 亵渎, or something else...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s the mysterious organization that Russell joined, collecting a few cards is normal... Even if they didn't, they still have the "stone slate"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was shocked and asked inexplicably:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do they have to deal with the Duke of Nigan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of "desire apostles" is a little thinner, with a hollow tone Said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, I only want to pick up this task."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Have you heard of anything?” Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Desire Apostles" is still the state of no ups and downs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard about them The main idea is to resurrect, or to awaken the true Creator.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They interfere with the progress of history, let it meet their own needs, in order to complete the goal at a certain node . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the trend of the times is not as they expected, they will try to reverse this trend.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Besides, they just sit quietly and watch indifference. Maybe there will be no action or commission for hundreds of years..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The hidden organization in the true sense...consistent with the characteristics of Russell’s secretly manipulating the world’s general trend... and the relationship with the original Creator... Klein’s spiritual deeds of “desire apostles” will dissipate Busy and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the name of the organization? How can I contact them? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Desire Apostle" looked at the front without feeling, and the figure quickly disintegrated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before he disappeared completely, he answered the question just now:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their names are:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Twilight Hermitage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the house with a glasshouse . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slim secretary, Mr. Secretary with gold-rimmed glasses and white gloves sat sullenly in his face, and there was deep sorrow in his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your name? What is the sequence, which is the extraordinary way?" Iconser asked seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde secretary replied slowly with a low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lockhad Siacam , Sequence 5, As for which extraordinary path I belong to, you can apply to view my file at MI9."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." ICONSER turned Asked, "Does the Duke have a fixed time every week?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
