It is like a drop of dew on the tender petals of the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, Klein grasped his own spirituality and recovered a certain consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a fireplace in front of him, a rocking chair in front of the fireplace, and an old woman wearing a black and white dress on the rocking chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the other person looked down and couldn’t see it, Klein felt that she was an old lady and she was quite determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman is right, there is a table, newspapers on the table, tin cans with silver inlay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Klein, who is familiar with the scene, is quickly recognizing what he sees:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is the residence of Riel Bieber and his mother! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was the first place I saw the "Giant View" on the spot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are clues to the ‘clown’ potion?” Klein’s thoughts just flashed and the surrounding scene changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a gray-white warehouse that is hidden in the innermost side of the same building;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it There are scattered bones of white and white, and several groups of flesh and blood are crushed by boulder;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the warehouse is a fist size The gray thing, its surface is covered with gullies, giving a soft and quality feeling, like a living brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just recognized what it was, just remembering what it was, the picture in the eye was like a reflection of the water being shattered and broken, and a new one was derived.朦胧景:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The naked body lies on a long table covered with white cloth, with a bloody blue ball in front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein suddenly frowned and panned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lar. The place where Bo hides and his remnants, now the thing that the swallowtail clown wrist is branded?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just when he tried to figure out what these pictures really symbolize The change of the scene is abruptly aggravated: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marble coffee table, a combination of leather sofas in the main and second forms, chandeliers hanging from the ceiling;<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brunette Brown, a temperamental Klein Moretti, a sleek, fair-skinned man with gauze gloves and a beautiful young lady;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-breasted middle-aged man with thick, hard, rooted erection, rich man with round body and fair complexion, eyebrows messy, brown hair sparse, eyelid gray blue Half of the old man, and a dark black note placed on the round table between them, the notes of ancient and distant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notes from the Antignus family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein Horan sat up straight, and there was no residue in the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the innocent fog and deep red stars outside the Shrine, he was horrified and puzzled:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a clue to the divination 'clown' potion... How come out the notes of the Antigonus family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I think, I think, the guy who is round and round is Welch, right, Welch, bought the Antignus family notes, triggering the aftermath of a series of events... The young lady with gauze gloves and beautiful looks is Naia..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remembered that the combination of the marble coffee table and the leather sofa was the hallmark of Welch's residence, where I saw the 'Psychic' Dai Li."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, I just saw the living room of Welch's residence and saw the scene where the original owner and the two classmates discussed the notes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ryan’s mind settled, calmed down, and the fingers rhythmically struck the edge of the bronze long table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does the last picture represent? Welch appeared. Was it the scene when he bought the 'antiquities'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other two people present, one is very familiar, The middle-aged man wearing a black classical robe seems to have seen it... Hedgehog-like brown hair, thick dark circles... Yes, I know who he is, Hynas. Vansente, the sea of ​​Divination Club Nas. Vincent, Insina steals the secret spell, and is sneaked into the dream by the captain, 'Helen. Vansente who died peacefully!' Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, is that note that he sold to Welch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" A circle, even so connected, the world is really small, no, Tingen is really small! Think about it, it is really possible, Henas. Vincent is not an ordinary diviner, obviously deep into the mysterious field, get The gaze of an ancient evil spirit, he has the ability to have the opportunity to get the notes that the secret repair will accidentally leak out..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No wonder the captains have not checked Where did Welch buy the notes, because the direction was completely wrong, they were trying to troubleshoot the antiquities market... Later, with the specific whereabouts of the notes, they gave up this attempt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, Hainas. Vincent has not died for a long time, otherwise he will be able to find some notes related to him... as a person who has deepened into the mysterious field, He should have studied the note... his death is really a coincidence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There is still a person present, a veteran in his fifties, and he may know a lot of things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein tapped the finger on the edge of the table and paused. The pictures I saw in "Dream Divination" have all passed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Riel Bieber's home; Riel Bieber's hiding place; Riel Bieber's Remnants; Stuffed Clown's Wrist's Branded Things; Welch's Home; Welch, Naya and the Original Hosting Scene; Welch, Heiners Vansente and Antigonus The 'photograph' of the family notes... oh, except for the brand of the tuxedo clown, all others are directly related to the Antignus family notes! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But my divination is the clue of the 'clown' potion... This is not scientific, no, this is not occult!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After becoming a "divination", Klein tried to take the Antignus family notes from where Diul Welch bought, but not at the time Considering the speciality above the fog, he could not get the revelation, but now, when he is divining another thing, he seems to have accidentally brought out the truth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Calm for a dozen seconds, Klein combined with the contents of Russell's diary, began to try to interpret the dream just now:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first possibility, Chalat , or the secret society, is looking for and chasing the relics of the Antignus family, so the symbolic meaning of this dream is that with the help of the Antignus family, the seduction will appear and the 'clown' will be obtained. The recipe for potions. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second possibility, the notes of the 'Clown' potion are recorded directly in the notes of the Antigonus family... The Charato family is Looking for traces of the Antignus family, indicating that there is a deep relationship between them, perhaps a friend, perhaps an enemy, so it is normal for the Antigonus family to master the partial sequence of the other party, friends do not have to say The enemy is the most aware of each other's existence..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the second symbolic explanation can't be linked to the brand of the tuxedo clown, hey, I Hope is the second, and when the church is looking for an expert to interpret the notes, I can get the 'clown' potion without risk. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At first glance, the first explanation is probably the most, but the intuition of the divination tells me that there should be a deeper symbolic meaning." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein licked his forehead and suddenly felt deeply into the limitations of the divination.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Unless it is a simple, intuitive symbol, the divination of the divination must be cautious, like walking on the edge of the abyss, walking on the thin ice lake, once the interpretation is wrong, or can not understand the most critical meaning The tuxedo clown is a living, bloody example!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Klein had the illusion that he had grasped the true meaning of the divination. It seemed that he could only completely digest the potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for using your life to raise me... praise the goddess!" He whispered, drawing a blushing moon on his chest. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he was divinced that Azick’s goodwill and whether it was a great one, all got a positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, continuous divination and consumption above the fog made Klein feel tired and he had to stop the divergence of his thoughts. The key things: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As soon as possible, find the old man who appeared in the same picture with Welch, Hyners Vansente, Antigonus family notes ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can start with the Divination Club."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is nothing to go to Mr. Zucker ran there. Well, he may be a member of the life school of the sequence, but this lacks some information and cannot be divined..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呼,克Ryan vomited, and the parchment on the parchment that appeared in front of him highlighted the portrait of a half-old man with a frown eyebrow, a sparse brown hair, and a gray-eyed eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the third person who was present when Welch and Heinz Vansente traded the Antignus family notes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the portrait, Klein suddenly fell into a dilemma:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I won't draw Painting, I have been the subject of teacher criticism in the art class of elementary school."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Using ritual magic, like old Neil? But this is to the goddess Pray... The matter is based on the speciality above the fog... If it is discovered by the gods, I can't be a man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, Maybe I can pray to myself! It’s almost the same as passing the picture... Even though I can’t shake the mysterious power above the fog for a while, this little thing should not be a problem!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the idea, Klein immediately spreads the spirit, wraps himself, and simulates the feeling of falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the bedroom, he whispered "pray" with the gas light:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A fool who does not belong to this age;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the mysterious ruler above the fog;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the king of yellow and black for good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for your revelation and pray that you will let me paint the picture I see. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading these mantras, Klein did not sprinkle oil, did not burn herbs, did not rely on their power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray to yourself is so casual! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ear whispered, and he saw the four black dots that formed a square on the back of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the four steps counterclockwise, while walking and reading the mantra, Klein re-enters the madness, penetrates the frenzy, and returns to the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he did not find which deep red star was shrinking and expanding, but noticed the back of the top of the tall bench in the bronze long table, by the part The quirky symbols of the "Innocent Eyes" and some "Twisted Lines" are shimmering in faint light, swaying illusory prayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened to the ear and confirmed the correct appearance of the "third person" portrait, in accordance with the way of responding to pray, cast it to the rogue The shimmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he immediately left the mysterious world above the fog and returned to his bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just standing still, Klein immediately emerged the portrait and felt an illusory and weak force to add. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the pen, found a piece of white paper, and gave his willingness to express. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised Klein was that his right hand moved uncontrollably, depicting the lines quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
