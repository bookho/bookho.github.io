Guy, he can only get closer to the real world at the full moon every month, but still can't pass his shouts in. He is lucky, he met me, the protagonist of this era."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After writing the above paragraph, I read it myself, and suddenly I was a little embarrassed. Even if I used Chinese characters, I didn’t know how to bring a strong translation space. In the air, the memories of the past are really like dreams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"January 1, 1884, grand New Year's party, Flo Mrs. Nal is really a stunner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"January 2, my diplomacy The gentlemen of the council are stupid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On January 3, the original choice was too sloppy, and now it seems that whether it is an 'apprentice' , or 'Divination', 'The Thief', are all better, but unfortunately, there is no way to go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"January 4, why me The children will be so stupid? I have said it over 10,000 times, don't be fooled by those gods, no, those god sticks may have been fooled by themselves. The key to the potion is not to master, it is to digest! It is not excavation, it is playing! And the name of the potion is not only the core symbol, but also the specific image, but the 'key' of digestion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"September 22, against My alliance is being established, from Fossach in the north, Lun in the east, to Fenetport in the south, my enemies have finally come together, but I am not afraid, I will tell them by fact, weapons and The generation of knowledge is not compensated by the number of people and the low-order sequence. Besides, my men are not without, but high-end, Oh, they forgot who I am?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“On September 23, I lost contact with the ship looking for the land of God’s Abandonment. I should consider inventing the radiotelegraph, and hopefully it will not be affected by the storm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"September 24, Miss Isaac is more than Flånera Mrs. Er is more charming, maybe I am just missing youth. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is a copy of Linyi, based on the complexity of Chinese characters, the volume of each word has been enlarged a lot, so the content of each page is Not much, even for preservation and research, the back is blank, but even so, Klein still sees the tide, especially Russell's description of the key to the potion, let him find a problem "Thoughts", mastered the ecstasy of priceless secrets.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe this is the guiding light for my future extraordinary way!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the three-page manuscripts are diaries of different periods. It can be seen that Russell’s only one year was written only in one year. Habit, the two in November and September are temporarily undecided to determine which year..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the poor guy he found? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does digestion and play specifically mean? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the land of God's abandonment?" "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ...... <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; a doubt with surprise heart boiling Klein, so that he can not wait Immediately collect the diaries of Russell the Great and read them from beginning to end!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein? "At this point, the opposite of the old Neil confused spoke <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Klein woke up with busy laughing to hide:. <br /> <br /> & nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought I would be the most special one, I wanted to try to decipher and interpret. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a young man." Old Neil haha ​​nodded. "I used to think that I was the most special one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned over the three at hand The page manuscript, after confirming that he did not see the leak, handed them back, and casually asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We only have these few "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to see more Russell Diaries Diary! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think there will be a lot?" Old Neilmo licked the manuscript, wrinkles deeply sneered, "There are not many incidents involving extraordinary and mysterious events each year." Hey, mainly those super-species species are gradually dying in our northern continent. Without them, there will be no more potions, so there will be fewer and fewer extraordinary people. Hey, for centuries, dragons, giants and The elves have become records in the book, and even the seas no longer appear in the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this, Klein suddenly remembered one Terrier, immediately laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think it's time to build the 'Dragon and Giant Protection Association'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil couldn’t help but understand what it meant for a long time, and after figuring it, he patted the table and smiled quite happily, not enough gentleman:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, Klein, you are a humorous person. This is the tradition of our Lun Kingdom. The young people can’t be wrong. I don’t think too much. Hey, how can there be only dragons and giants? It should be called 'Magical Animal Protection Association'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, how can you forget those poor plants? Klein shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he and Daniel looked at each other and said the same thing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Magical Bio-Protection Association!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, the two tacitly laughed, the strange atmosphere just disappeared a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are fewer and fewer young people like you.... Where did I just say?" Old Neil’s face wrinkled and laughed. I remembered that there are not many incidents involving extraordinary and mysterious things each year. The idiots who worship the Russell emperor are a minority in the minority. We can get three manuscripts, which is very good... well, other The cathedral or parish should have..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He whispered a few words and took the "rat" that Klein had already placed on the table. At a glance: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a pistol bullet, or a rifle bullet, or a bullet for a steam high-pressure gun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"A revolver." Klein replied according to the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I am going to take it out, cough, do you have a gun pocket? As a gentleman, you can't let your waist and below in public." Bulging the drums." Old Neil opened a joke that men know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, no, need to find the captain to write it up?" Klein smiled with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil stood up and got up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, just record it, it belongs to 'Auxiliary items', follow me, 'supporting items'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have been a teacher before?" Klein asked with a funny smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stay in the church's Sunday school and free school for a while." Old Neil raised the note, took out the key in the drawer, and opened the door. The iron gate in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary and ordinary people don’t feel much different... Klein silently sighed and turned his eyes to the three-page diary on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell really involved the mysterious field...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His diary is worthless... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For others, it’s just a piece of waste paper, I don’t know when it’s time to decipher, for me, that’s the treasure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't know where the remaining diaries are...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to find a way to find more...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein’s thoughts are ups and downs, and it’s hard to calm down until the old Neil comes out of the house and closes the iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten hunting demon bullets, thirty pistol bullets, a psoriasis gun bag, a special action department seventh team badge, you check it out, Give it a try and sign a word on the notebook.” Old Neil put the items in his hand on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pistol bullets are packed in cartons, divided into three layers, neatly arranged, and yellow as clear as the bullets in Klein’s home, slightly slender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunting Bomb" is held in a small iron box, the shape is the same as a normal pistol bullet, but the appearance is silvery, look at the complex and dazzling pattern, even at the bottom Inscribed with a small emblem of "black-and-white stars and red half moon". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leather gun bag has a solid touch, the buckle has a buckle, and the half-hand palm-sized badge is iron-colored and has a silver-plated “Ahwa County Police Hall”. "The seventh group of the Special Operations Department" text, they are wound into two closed loops, surrounded by the "double sword crosses the crown". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately not the badge of the night owl." Klein was half-satisfied and tempted to say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil smiled and only urged Klein to try and smash the gun bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unloading the jacket, Klein took a lot of effort to buckle the gun bag and clung to the arm of the left arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not bad." He didn't take it anymore and put on his formal dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil looked at his eyes and nodded with satisfaction:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very suitable, my vision Still so accurate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect other items in your pocket, and after signing the name on the notebook, Klein chatted with the old Neil. The sentence just left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was halfway, he suddenly became annoyed and took his forehead:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forgetting to ask More sequences are related to potions, and they all blame Russell's diary..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still unclear about the one that the Night Goddess Church has mastered. The beginning of the sequence of the complete 'pathway', that is, the sequence 9, what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosanna seems to have mentioned one...insomnia? Just as Klein walked slowly toward the stairs, a figure fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears tight-fitting trousers that are easy to move, white shirts have not been plunged, and there is a clear poet's romantic temperament, just before the search for Klein's black-haired green 瞳The police officer, the two of them have seen one side upstairs, but they have not spoken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon." The poet-like young night singer smiled and said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, I don't think I have to introduce myself?" Klein was humorous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I am very impressed with you." The young night-timer extended his right hand, "Leonard Mitchell, Sequence 8' at midnight The poet '."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sequence 8... It’s really a poet... Klein spoke a little with him, and asked with a smile:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very impressed with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Mitchell is deeply green and smiles very shallowly: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have a special temperament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......gay gay... gram Ryan’s mouth twitched and barely smiled: “I don’t think so.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There was such an incident and there was no first time to accept our protection, You are still alive, which is special enough in itself.” Leonard pointed to the front. “I have to replace the captain and see you tomorrow.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See." Klein sideways let go of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he stepped away at the end of the stairs, Leonard Mitchell suddenly turned and stared at the dim light and slate floor, facing the air Self-talk: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
