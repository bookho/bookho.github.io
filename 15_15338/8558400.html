			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scented leaves bar, corner location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erland found a man in a brown jacket and took a photo of the other person’s shoulder, laughing happily:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I not drink violently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is in his thirties and has a very popular face, but it is obvious that there is Lun lineage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has brown hair and a high nose, and the original drunken appearance suddenly disappears, and his eyes become sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swept Allan and Klein, and the light became cloudy again, as if it was full of alcohol:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already drunk, come to Zarha to solve the wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zarha is a local malt beer The price is cheap and the flavor is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erland heard two words and pointed to Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "German Sparo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he introduced Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Us. Kent, call him Kent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You talk, I have to go back and prepare, I will leave Hong Kong tomorrow morning. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his hand and turned away without hesitation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pulled over The chair, sitting down, not drinking, just looking at Uz Kent in a blank expression.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kent was seen very uncomfortable, poured Mouth Zalha: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After anything, you can come to me, as long as you can provide valuable information or help us do something." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not worried about the alcoholics around him hearing the conversation between the two, because many gangs and pirates also say that the words when recruiting informants are often Almost.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. "Klein would like to ask if the cost of clothing that Yilian assassinated the disease will be reimbursed, even though it is the money from Daniz.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, He just thought about it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Us. Kent seems to be drunk and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I listened to Elland mentioning some of your things, but I still have to remind you that in the sea, things can't be so crazy, especially pay attention to it, try not to provoke pirates, I mean don't face confrontation There is no problem in providing intelligence to us privately, we will keep it confidential for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he obviously lowered his voice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See German. Sparo Without responding, he added: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The pirates will not talk to you about the spirit of the knight, nor will they abide by the laws and rules of the kingdom, oh, if If you live in a port city or an island colony, they can definitely attack your family. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family... Klein silently for a second, plainly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have a family." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Ust Kent almost didn't know what to pick up, so he turned to say, "They will attack your friends." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he heard that German Sparo’s tone replied without any ups and downs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not have friends. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coughed twice and said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will also attack you, buy people, figure out your itinerary, intercept the boat you are riding, On the sea, the power of the individual is often small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein said quite calmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I will not refuse to give money to others.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is polite. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send money? Uskent clearly stunned and didn't understand the meaning of German Sparrow.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, he suddenly realized that the other party was using the pirates as a reward for the move.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a sip of beer, I drank a beer and couldn’t speak for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the underground area of ​​the bar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfamily adventurer? "The ingenuity" Misor. Kim spirited and sat up straight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gian Lux" Ozl nodded:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to 'Blue Eyes' Mises, the adventurer was very unfamiliar, it should have been in the waters of the islands, but it gave him a very dangerous feeling. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very dangerous? Would it be the one who joined forces with "Flame" Daniz to kill "Steel" Maviti? It would be a fake Lian, the man who attacked the captain? Misor’s mind had a certain association, and he asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have his photo or portrait? ? "[< /> /> </ br> <br /> ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a use of the ceremony, so that 'Blue Eyes' Mises paints the look of the strange adventurer, you know, to stand in the underground world of Bayam, and to be a successful pirate is Not the same, you have to have support staff, hey, I spent a lot of money to hire them. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misol understands the other person's hidden meaning, chuckle one voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you can find out this, the captain will not reward you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the portrait and unfolded it and found that it was a black-haired brown man with a thin face and a sharp and angular man wearing a black double-breasted length. Dress, wearing a half-height silk hat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven’t seen it, I can’t confirm whether it’s disguised as Yilian’s person... Misor raised his head:< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Check out his identity and whereabouts. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have told people to do it." "Gi Lishi" Ozil smiled calmly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were silent at the same time, each drinking Nanwei red wine.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, a bar guard came in and broke the atmosphere of no one talking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the The speaker, "Missor, got in the ear of his own boss and whispered a few words.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ozl’s expression suddenly became quite weird and mixed Mixed with some unspeakable smiles.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put down his tall glass and paused:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Found the strange adventurer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where? "Missor asked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ozl pointed to the top:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misor looked up at the ceiling and said for a few seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went up to see and make a confirmation."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has had contact with people who pretend to be red-haired Elaine, and has a general understanding of similar abilities, thinking that even if the other person can disguise himself, he should have a certain sense of familiarity, so Decided to confirm it in person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his original habits, he would not actually take the initiative to do so, but to do the external investigation first, and with a little grasp, he only entered, but This time, he didn't believe too much about Ozil's men. If he was a disguised Yilian person, he would change his appearance, change his identity, and disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Misor knows that he is currently being punished by the captain and must be quick to make a return to the Black Death. Br 哎 哎 哎 哎 哎 哎 哎 哎 哎The death number, almost killed the captain...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In exchange for the former Qilingus, it will not forgive me, oh, he has been very greedy, right My extraordinary ability has longed for a long time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The captain did not think that I and the attacker could change with the help of 'squirming hunger'. Cooperation, convening other people to kill me on the spot, just sending me to Baiam to investigate this matter, is enough tolerance... Compared with Qilingus, she is a captain who really deserves allegiance. I must make meritorious deeds as soon as possible. Excuses to contact her, do not live up to her treatment." Misor. Kim got up and walked out, while the thoughts could not help but some roll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is a pirate who has killed many people and has taken many boats, he has a soft place in his heart, and he has not found it. "The disease will be" Trey's long-term relationship, has been repeatedly charmed by the other side, the good feeling has penetrated into the bone marrow, even if the "disease girl" has no helper, let him kneel to the ground, kiss the toes, he will not resist, do not error. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this will not affect his inner fantasy and Trey to do something that is not suitable for children. If there is an opportunity, even if he does not get the permission of the captain, he believes I will take the initiative to do it myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a pirate, he has done a lot of similar things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the upper level, Misol. Jin, according to the tips of Ozil, walked half a circle along the wall of the bar, and saw the sitting in the corner. The strange adventurer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with portraits...but no familiarity...is he pretending to be good enough, or someone else, for example, "Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina? She can simulate the extraordinary ability she has seen. It is not impossible to change like Zierlings... Misor's eyes pause for two seconds and she carefully closes it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the diviner’s spiritual instinct has told Klein that someone is observing him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not cover up, immediately looked back, saw a man with short eyebrows, deep eye sockets, dark brown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smart-speaker" Misol. Kim... "The disease of the general" three of the flagship black death number... Klein recognized the observation Who is your own person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, he had two thoughts flashed in his mind at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is: "Bounty 5,400 pounds!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is: "Why did he observe I? He started from Daniz and found me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military contact Us Kent discovered the abnormality of German Sparrow Followed by his gaze, but because of the angle problem, was blocked by several alcoholic eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein has instinctive countermeasures, that is, pretending not to recognize Misor. Kim, withdrawing his sight, asking for a drink, and secretly observing Where did the other party go, and then use the ability of the no-faced person to mix into Misor’s hiding place and hunt each other silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea flashed past, and Klein suddenly found a problem:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
