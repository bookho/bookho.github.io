			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booking magic items? "Inverted people" Alger took a second to reflect what Miss "Justice" was saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limitations of his thinking were suddenly opened, and he felt that there was room for this thing to be used:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "In a sense, the extraordinary features of the 'world' commission have been sold out, and the items have a definite end point... I can simplify the process and make things easier and more beneficial to me, that is I don't have to sell it to the 'artisan'. I should choose the method of commissioning. In this way, I don't have to worry about whether the feature is sold or not. I can get the "world" and the "just" lady. Where more profits are harvested, the upfront costs that need to be paid are only commissioned, and of course, the risk of 'artisans' not complying with the promises must be considered...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea emerged, "hanging people" Alger quickly weighed the pros and cons and made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, I will deal with this matter." He looked to Miss "Justice" and felt that the other party exudes a golden light that people can't directly look at. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he joined the storm church and floated on the sea for many years, he did not see such people elsewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea merchants have a lot of squanders, and the rich are more, but none of them really don’t care about money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missing "Justice" has a good financial situation? "The Fool" Klein was also shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, he wanted to spur the other party and let her pay the 2,000 pounds owed to her as soon as possible, but considering that she had promised Miss Justice Postponed to repay in February and March, and can only not say a word, keep still, so as not to undermine the image of "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least the "no-face-to-face" extraordinary features of the money can be quickly obtained, the speed depends only on the way of "downside down" Mr. contact a "craftsman" And the speed of making "magic goods" with "artisans"... Unfortunately, we can only contact the "artisans" by "inverted people" for the time being, otherwise you can directly sell the characteristics to the "just" lady, without paying for it... think of it, gram Ryan’s mood has become a bit complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finalizing a big business, Alger was relieved and felt that his financial situation was slowly improving. He thought for a few seconds and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a way or thing for everyone who is on a boat to sleep at the same time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Alger has not gone to the original island to kill the blue shadow today Because he had not thought of how to leave the "Blue Avenger" without suspicion, leaving the ten sailors and crew members who belonged to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let all the people in a boat fall asleep? Klein first thought of "biotoxin bottles", but the effect of this thing is simply uncontrollable, and the scene may not look good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he remembered the "nightmare" soul in "squirming hunger", letting people sleep, dragging people into dreams, belonging to this extraordinary profession Expertise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the problem is that 'nightmare' has no way to let so many people enter the dream at the same time, the limit that can be affected is no more than ten people, to satisfy the 'downside man' 'Mr.'s request, at least the sequence of the corresponding route 5, may even have the power of the semi-god and the half-human level..." Klein dismissed the idea and did not let the "world" speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, "Justice" Audrey, "Magic" Firth and "Sun" Dairik or shake their heads to respond, or "no" As an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moon" Emlin recalled the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can help you ask Q, maybe there are magical items with similar effects inside our blood family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always say "our blood family"... In the future, we can more convince from this aspect... ... "Inverted" Alger grasped something, and nodded with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trouble you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; See the end of the trading section, Klein is busy making the "World" the latest demand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everybody, help me pay attention to the residual spirituality of the ancient grievances and the eyes of the six-winged gargoyles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other auxiliary materials are not too difficult to buy, he I don't think it is necessary to pass the Tarot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." "Sun" Dairik first responded, then embarrassed to add, "Mr. World", you want to remove The method of spiritual pollution within the extraordinary characteristics still needs to wait for a while, and I should be able to promote the sequence 7 soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he looked to the side again: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Inverted man", as soon as I return to Silver City, I will sort out the list of common monsters in the surrounding area."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything owed to others, every promise promised and not completed, he is firmly in mind, feel that sleep is not stable enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem." The gloomy "world" did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not too anxious, his "No-face-to-face code" has not yet been summed up, the digestion of potions has only begun, followed It will take several months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, his plan is not to go straight to the Gargas Islands, active in the colonial islands along the way as "adventurers" and "travelers", from time to time Change your identity and experience life to refine the “No-face to others” code. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, he will inquire about the mermaid in more detail - knowing that the goddess church raises this spiritual creature and holds the high level of the "divination" After the sequence of potions, Klein was always worried that there were traps in the Gargas Islands for every "no face" who sought to be promoted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Klein has spent two or three months or more on sea travel and adventure in the sea of ​​Sonia, which is long enough for the sun "Get the potion recipe, collect the corresponding materials, and promote to the "Sun God Official" of Sequence 7. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the end of the trading section, members of the Tarot Club entered the free time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey did not live up to the expectation of "downside down", first stood up, imaginary skirt, the first line of the bronze long table :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, I want to know the truth behind the Baker Rand smog incident, which is purely for those cults in order to make 'original Did the Witch's wake up and the 'real creator' come down? Why did Prince Edsack choose to work with them?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the principle of exchange of equivalence What do I need to pay to get the corresponding information? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that things have been completely solved now...experienced Klein maintains a leisurely sitting position, chuckling:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The root of the problem has not been discovered, but there are enough clues to hope that the people of the three churches should not be too stupid."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root cause of the problem has not been discovered? Things have not been completely resolved? Mr. "The Fool" let the deceased leave some clues to the church and the military? Audrey was shocked, but felt that it was not too unexpected in her previous worries and worries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your answer." She took the ceremony again with sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland is still dangerous? "Magic" Firth was a little upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Miss "Justice" sat down, Klein manipulated the "world" and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mr. 'Panging Man', I found the Barron you said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Balun involving many slave escapes from the colonial island? "The hanging man" did not believe in a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, brown-red skin, Southland race, Beckland accent, the third tooth on the left is a denture." "World" hoarsely replied . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It should be him." "The hanging man" Alger recalled two seconds. "Where is he? What is his current status? Also, Mr. 'World', do you want to take 100 pounds of cash directly, or is it equivalent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the mission of the Storm Church. The purchase of clues is an act of reimbursement, so there is no pressure to “slow down people”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course it is money! Klein, who is worrying about living expenses, manipulates the "world" road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"100 pounds in cash.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Barron in Beckland, someone saw him meet with a military officer who was loyal to the royal family. Who is it, I don't know, because the other person wears a mask. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The nine officers of the military loyal to the royal family..." "The hanging man" chewed this passage and suddenly thought of the problem of Miss Justice. : Why did Prince Edessack cooperate with the Aurora and the witch sect?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also points to the royal family... Can the two cases be merged? The truth behind the matter involves The slaves are missing? Alger feels that he has vaguely seen some key points.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really a channel with lots of informed people, that 100 pounds of cash will Pay tomorrow. "The hanging man" Alger was quietly thankful for the sentence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘿. "The world" laughed and turned to the "sun":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little guy, do you know Guhmes? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric did not conceal, honestly replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have heard of He Mies, but Silver City does not have this knowledge. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Second Age, there was no distinction between Hermes and Ancient Hermes, until the Quaternary did not know what age, only to the ancient Hermes With the corresponding simplification, it is more convenient for daily application, teaching and dissemination, but no longer has such a strong and direct ritual effect, that is to say, the Hermes language in the mouth of the small "sun" is equal to the ancient Hermes language... Silver In the history of the city, there is such a person as Hermes... Klein secretly nodded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is a pity that I would have liked to ask you a favor. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "justice" Audrey remembered one thing from their conversation, from the psychological alchemy society.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She intended to communicate directly, but she could see the new member "Moon" and felt that she didn't know each other too much, so she had to give a small amount of kick:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, I have something to report to you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gently decapitated and isolated the perception of others.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" ? He asked in a plain tone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey said truthfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am mentally Alchemy got some news, the most important of which was that they were built by excavating the remains of Hermes, the master of Hermes who created the ancient Hermes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remains of Hermes? The old gentleman was alive a hundred or two years ago...was he deliberately guiding the psychological alchemists to discover the relics, or was already in Rousse? In the incident, Klein was shocked and thought about it. The smile reminded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hermes is a member of the 'Twilight Hermitage'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not mention that Hermes might still be alive, because this is not certain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Mies is a member of the "Twilight Hermit Society"? The psychological alchemy meeting is likely to involve this mysterious organization? Audrey was shocked and immediately relieved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, there is a Tarot meeting behind me, there is a "fool", otherwise there is no way to know, can not be prepared... She once again gratefully praised the "fool".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Klein wanted to relieve the "Justice" two sentences, so that she should not be too painful and too worried about the Baker Rand smog incident, maturity does not mean to give up a certain good mood and smile on the face, this will not affect The emphasis on things can help them to stay longer, but after considering it, in order to maintain the image of the "fool", he had to give up the advice from the former "clown".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
