			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the high-study lecturer boarded the half-height wooden platform in front of the small auditorium and let go of the scorpion and said:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, good and kind lady, I am Syedra. Heda. I want to share with you the experience of arranging family expenses today. This is divided into three parts. How should households with an annual income of around £100 balance the cost of food, housing, clothing and servants, and second, what should be increased for families with an annual income of £200 to make themselves look more decent...”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa listened carefully, remembering the annual income of the two brothers without counting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than 200 pounds..." She was half gratified and thought about it with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is both happy and contented with her present life, and she is afraid that it will disappear in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Selena with burgundy hair covered her mouth and lowered her voice to two friends:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She seems to be the believer of the storm, she wears the storm badge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa stares and sees Seliya Teacher La’s left chest is wearing a badge depicting wind and waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly explained:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That told me that Mrs. Shaw is the Lord of the Storm. Believers, I think the teacher is not too strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I don't feel any problem, we are here to listen to the specific bill plan." Elizabeth relieved Melissa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, except for Melissa, we don't need or qualify for a family spending plan." Selena, the red-haired hair, muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth retorted without hesitation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we will eventually get married, eventually there will be My own family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the "Magic Mirror Divination" incident, Selena has been a little scared of Elizabeth, had no choice but to pretend to listen carefully. Look like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lecturer Syedira pulled up the right hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The premise is that we must respect the opinions of the male masters. They are the source of income and the pillars of the family. They are worried, stressed, troubled and confused in the turbid society, winning everything for us. Therefore, we must create a The tranquil environment disturbed by external affairs, let them go home and relax, let their hearts be baptized, and respond to various challenges in a better state..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "So, the famous philosopher, sociologist, humanist, and economist Mr. Luermi once said that women are the angels of the family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Selena held her cheek, outlined the dimples, and whispered with a little excitement: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lurmi, who said that 'life is from 'Mr.?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but he is a believer in the storm." Elizabeth The answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the lecture teacher Syedira continued: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lurmi Mr. also tells us that women are dying in wisdom and logic. If we do not have the ability to judge, we should accept the words of father and husband as religious beliefs..." (Note 1)<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This description is heard by Melissa, Selina, and Elizabeth. You see me, I see you, and I can't speak for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go?" Finally, Selena tried to suggest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa and Elizabeth nodded at the same time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took the caps, squatted back, slid toward the side door, trying to leave without paying attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they cautiously arrived outside and stood up straight, they suddenly heard a warm applause in the small auditorium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa turned back and looked through the doorway, looking inside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw Xiao De The wife is applauding and sees a lady applauding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, praise the beautiful god... Melissa sighed and stayed away with Selena and Elizabeth away from the place that made her uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go to the Harrods department store?" Standing under the roadside road, Selena forgot what she had just said and happily proposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa is silent for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to go back to study."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Learning..." Selena snorted and licked her burgundy hair and seemed to be back to her usual life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I have to buy bread, buy beef, buy potatoes, buy fruit... Klein wants to work today, Banson goes to the municipal library, um Well, I have to go back!" Melissa suddenly felt that she loved textbooks like that, loves the clockwork, and loves gear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina decided to stay away from Melissa, who is in an abnormal state today, looking sideways at Elizabeth, and laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do we both go to the Harrods department store? Although I have spent a lot of money on private homes, it is good to have a look around."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Elizabeth promised her friend's proposal, and asked like a mouthful, "Melissa, your brother Klein will work on Sunday?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, he rests on Monday, not the same as ordinary work." Melissa unconsciously raised her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving the Black Thorny Security Company, Klein took the rail public carriage Go to the Howth Street neighborhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to consolidate his thoughts, no longer thinking about the treasures of the Antignus family, and letting his attention return to the "playing" of this matter. Top:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as possible, digesting the potion as soon as possible, it is very important at all times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Playing the divination, oh, I am still not professional enough. The fortune teller who eats the country must do all the things in the yellow calendar..." Klein With a cane, sit in the position inside the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to divination in advance whether it is good for travel today and is good for a divination club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a qualified diviner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking for the opportunity to get off the bus, Klein pulled out a half-penny copper coin, his eyes followed, and his eyes flew deep and silently: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today is suitable for divination clubs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today is suitable for divination clubs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein popped up the coin, not looking at its roll, but flattening out the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! The half-penny copper coin fell and fell steadily in his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, it is the "1/2" number that wheat spikes up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The number is facing up, which means that today's divination club will encounter bad things..." Klein thought about it and turned to the street. Wait for the public carriage to go to the direction of Narcissus Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels more and more like a god stick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halls Street, Harrods department store door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina was waiting to enter, suddenly bowed and turned to look to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Elizabeth asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina drums up the drums to help the child:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elizabeth, I think of my mystery Teacher Mr. Vincent, he passed away this way and passed away the next morning of my birthday..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this because I peeked and Using his secret spells? This made me always feel embarrassed and upset... and, during this time, I was never lucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So? Elizabeth asked very tacitly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina bites her lips:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to go to the divination club next to me Divination, see if Mr. Vincent’s things really relate to me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened on the day of the birthday dinner...I always felt that Elizabeth had something to do I... I remember having a man in a tuxedo...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you not divination yourself?" Elizabeth asked strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina deliberately learns how his father sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, my current The state is not suitable for divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, let's go to the divination club next to you." Elizabeth agreed with her friend's proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came to the side and entered the Divination Club on the second floor along the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, good afternoon, Miss Angelica, I am very happy to see you again." In the reception hall, Selena screamed lively. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you come over after lunch, it should be I can meet me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina and the other person sneered a few words, mourned Henas. Vincent, and then said:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know the rules of the club, this is a member album that is willing to divination ... Today is the weekend, a lot of people are there." An Jielika is familiar with the process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heads of Selena and Elizabeth got together and quickly flipped through the list and presentations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I used to go directly to my teacher every time. I didn't expect the club to have so many members who are willing to help people to divinate." Linna said with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, she paused for a few seconds, whispering in confusion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein Moretti , Klein Moretti? Is this the same as Melissa's brother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth stunned and repeatedly read "Klein Morey "These words" are repeated several times, if you think about it: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Angelica, is this Mr. Klein Moretti?" Selena asked brightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika shook her head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Klein Moretti Mr. did not come to the club today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, change one more." Selena didn't have to know each other's thoughts, just snickering at friends "I know that this will not be Melissa's brother, but when I saw this name, I naturally came up with a news headline, the headline of the "Intis Post"."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
