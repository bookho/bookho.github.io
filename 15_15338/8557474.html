			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until leaving the underground area of ​​Odra, Emlin White has some psychedelic, can't believe that it is so easy to get a reward of 7,000 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill was held in his hand, and there was no weight in the light, but it made him realize the absurdity of reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method of "swinging people" really works... The adults of Nibes did not expose me, punish me, but gave me a generous reward, and this only It is to pretend that I don’t know, encourage me to continue to try, so that I can observe it in secret... The blood of the blood is also so complicated... Emlin sighed for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he converges on the idea of ​​divergence and turns his attention back to the £7,000 reward:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"With it, I can buy the baron's relic from the 'downside man' and mix it into a potion...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will Become a baron, the blood male baron Emlin White. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin's eyes are bright and his steps are a lot lighter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blood family If there is no gift from the elders, the corresponding ceremony, the level at which it is born, will be fixed at what level, and it is almost impossible to rely on time to improve.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blood races of the same age as Emlin, except for their luck, the life of the family ancestors is close to the limit, and they have to be given the power of the younger generation through rituals. Most of them still stay in the concept of "adult" and have not been obtained for decades. The possibility of "knight".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin's father and mother have lived for so many years, and until now, they still have not become barons, and even do not see any hope! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he got out of the gate, Emlin couldn’t help but look at Kasimi Odra next to his eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This older blood family who was active in the Russell period, until now, is just a baron... and me, I am about to reach this level! One day, I want to be the Marquis of the blood family like Nibes! No, the Duke, even the Prince! Only in this way can I bear the responsibility of the blood savior... Well, the Baron’s relics are also four. More than a thousand pounds, there is still a lot of money left, you can buy a few more dolls, and then add some new clothes for them... Emlin does not feel straight up and walks more and more high-spirited.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baiyin City, Berg Home.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Derico lights up the candle and prepares for the sacrifice ceremony,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After several times the lightning frequency alternates, he finally waited for the opportunity.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very convinced that the "chief" can't stare at himself at this moment because he took the injured boy Jack and an exploration team and left the Silver City. , looking for the other party's route from the so-called seaside to the ruined city-state.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long, Dairik set everything up,虔Solemnly mournfully mourn the name of Mr. "The Fool".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very skilled and methodically will be the "magician" Miss need to eat the appetizer The extraordinary material designated by Mr. "Down Man" was sacrificed to the master of the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solid walls of Silver City have many gaps, but they are filled with black hard soil with a cluster of fine weeds in the wind. Gently shake, like human hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, they all rose up and seemed to want to catch something, but they fell without any effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, the Church of the Waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger Wilson, who came to collect the bounty, heard a very important message from the parish bishop Joe Gorley:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Morce accompaniment" of Laticia Dorera, as an archaeologist, has entered the depths of the jungle in the island of Symi, she did not know what to do, resulting in The "Poseidon" Cavitewa, which has been hit hard for many years, is about to collapse, and madly looks for opportunities to continue its existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rumored that this evil spirit, claiming to be "Poseidon", was discovered a long time ago. After the discovery of the Rhodes Islands, it was the strongest of the two cardinals and the military. With the help of the corresponding seals, they could barely escape and hide... The situation has lasted for more than a hundred years. There is no essential change. How suddenly does it collapse and cannot maintain itself? Alger frowned, thinking about what happened differently from the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The situation in which the 'Moss Assassination Society' deliberately created?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why haven’t they done this for years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to tie in with another plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the speculation and doubts, Alger suddenly I noticed an important factor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest and most fundamental difference between the past and the past 100 years is:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the world" comes Arrived in Byam! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of Mr. "The Fool" came to the Rothde Islands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does he appear, it means that there will be big events happening or brewing? There was a Bakerland smog in the middle, and a change in Banxi Port in the middle. Now it is the unsuccessful attempt of the "Poseidon" Cavitowa and the unknown attempt of the "Moss accompaniment"... No, more accurately describe Yes, where the big things are brewing or about to happen, where the "fool" will come! They accept the arrangement of Mr. Fool, chasing the activities of secret organizations and angels of evil spirits! When the train of thought changed, Alger suddenly became more cheerful and felt that he had grasped the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not where the "world" is, where things will go wrong, but where is going to happen, where the "world" and other leaders will appear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What good is this for Mr. Fool? Is it purely to destroy the plot of hostile forces, or is this conducive to his unblocking and revealing more power? Alger pressed his doubts and decided to seize the opportunity to submit some information before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a fist in his right hand, against the left chest, hesitantly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jogo Lord, I heard about a message in the process of tracing the remnants of 'Steel'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Jogori had planned to arrange this. The captain-level captain went to the sea to find the traces of the resistance, but was forcibly interrupted by the other party, and was sometimes annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger "memories" said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone mentioned Bansy Harbour in the chat, It was said that there was a change, but the descendants of the Medici family were well hidden and not found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banxi Port, the change...Jogori One step, ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did they say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They said the church has The bishop was there and the rest was gone. Lord Jogori, is the Medici family a dark family of the Quaternary?” Alger deliberately asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jogori's face sinks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not something you should know.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will report to Mr. Courtman immediately. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This refers to Cardinal of the Storm Church, Archbishop of Rothde, the true ruler of the archipelago's extraordinary world, Yarn Courtman.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jogori thought about it and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the person who mentioned this matter? What does it look like? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger is ready:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know them, they don't have any more appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember that the Banxi Port and the Medici family are ordinary young men with a thin face, wide forehead, dark eyes, black hair, Wearing a monocle of crystal glasses.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He seems to have noticed that I was eavesdropping, but not angry, but smiled at me. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Alger described is the "God of the Gods" Amon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants the cardinal to think that the secret exposure of the Medici family and Banxi is due to the battle between the kings of angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really an object that is very suitable as a reason... He will not come out to justify anything, even if he argues, no one will believe... and to him Divination, obviously will not have any effect... If you use extraordinary means to confirm my source, there will be strong signs of interference and no accurate answer because of the "fool", which is equivalent in performance. Amon did... Alger thought quite confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jogori nodded lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look for these people and trace the resistance The whereabouts of the army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Lord Jogori!" Alger responded devoutly and held his right boxing left chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-altitude clouds cascading, the sky is dim to the extreme, the rain is falling , ticking, splashing white mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Yam, the blue waters are slowly but firmly rising, and the passenger ship is rickety, as if floating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain does not stop, the sea level gradually approaches the embankment, water accumulates in many places in the city, and the environment is abnormally suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fanatic and numb local, wearing a tarpaulin, draped in a ragged jacket, one by one, on the edge of a cliff or on a levee. They jumped into the sea one after another, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh and skin of their bodies lost their moisture quickly, and when they fell into the sea, they became a long-deformed corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people cried and hugged a naval soldier who walked out of the base, biting him with his teeth in anger and sorrow, and biting out the horrible flesh. There is chaos above the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The embankment collapsed and the rising seawater poured into the city of Baiyam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein woke up, and the thoughts that he had just dreamed of echoed in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a diviner, this is a very obvious revelation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cavi Tuva's 'Poseidon' can't find a way to survive, completely give up, completely crazy, to create heavy rain, set off a tsunami, flood the entire Rosde Islands And countless people have funeral for it? At the same time, its followers have also done all kinds of extreme behavior... I have informed the Storm Church that they should have time to stop... No, even if I don’t notice, this happens, They can also detect the problem and respond accordingly...” Klein rolled out of bed, dressed, and walked out of the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the "flame" Daniz standing by the window, looking out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the low pressure of the clouds, the rain continued, as if there was no end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there signs? Klein walked to the side of Nitz, and also looked at the suppressed weather outside, and the ears faintly heard the abnormal tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silence, a very explosive thunder suddenly sounded in the air, the lead cloud quickly split, the falling rain lost support, the dock In the direction, everything is back to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is shining in the morning, and Baiam seems to be bathed in the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz snorted and said to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yan. Courtman changed the weather..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yan Kotman...The church of the storm, the cardinal? He suppressed the power of Cavitowan? Klein retracted his sight thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz breathed a sigh of relief:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was quite worried, hehe, Fear of the crashing 'Poseidon' to create a disaster.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
