			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, the huge stone pillars of the roots support a magnificent temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two groups of deep reds appearing next to the old and mottled bronze long table, blurring the image into an illusory figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Mr. Fool." Audrey, who added the effect of the singer, gave a sigh of relief and smiled. "It’s a pity that there is no wine here, otherwise you can Try to make a toast for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She refers to the ritual magic thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your strength is far beyond our imagination." Alger Wilson also praised him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein still enveloped the richest fog in his body, and his right hand slammed as if he was answering an ordinary thing:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good, this shows that we are on a fruitful path. If you have something in the future, you can't get away from it on Monday afternoon. Then hold a ceremony in advance and tell me, um. Just change the content of 'Pray for a good dream' in the mantra to a specific reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Audrey tone lightly Nod, "Mr. Fool, I got another page of Russell's diary, I should still owe one page."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This week, I am far away Land, I couldn't find a new one." Alger pressed his chest with his right hand and bent forward, apologizing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not care, the cycle of this matter is bound to be long." Kline leaned against the back of the chair, his index finger tapped on the armrest, looking to Miss "Justice", " You can now 'express' the diary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey faintly swears:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Follow your will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picks up the pen that suddenly appears on the table, and carefully recalls the runes that were forced to back down in her mind, and Give the will to express. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in a few seconds, she saw the parchment in front of it filled with content, dense, neat and orderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check it again, she put down the pen path:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"好好"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein raised his hand gently, and the parchment appeared in his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down, he began to read without emotion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"July 9, I suddenly thought of an interesting question. Since the sequence approach is also called the grace of God, the path of God, then why the slate that records the complete twenty-two sequence path will be called the slate, '亵渎', It’s a very meaningful vocabulary...who is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Who made the slate? Why can you master all the sequence paths? What is recorded? I really want to take a look..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On July 12, today I learned the fact that seals are important to the strength of the church. The components, even if some of them are very, very dangerous, and in the seven churches, the artisan church has the fewest seals and the lowest degree of relative danger... Did I join an organization with no future? It should be like this, only white paper is good for painting, weak group It is good for me to play!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On July 14th, I saw the mysterious Mr. Zaratu, who turned out to be an ancient organization The leader of the meeting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing here, Klein’s pupils shrank and almost showed an abnormal reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the information of the Church of the Night Goddess, the Charato family only had a certain connection with the secrets, to the place of Russell the Great, the mysterious Mr. Charato It was further proved to be the leader of the escort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the secrets will have no doubt about the "divination" sequence...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Just as Klein read the diary, Audrey looked up and habitually began to observe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, her gaze, her gaze, was completely blocked by the rich fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;愣愣, Audrey stunned back, panicked and turned to look at the illusory dark red star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am so reckless, too bold, too stupid, I want to observe Mr. Fool... okay, okay, he is not angry." Audrey Quietly spit out the tongue, pretend to enjoy the leisurely appearance of the scenery, just lick a gentle melody in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger sat silently, staring straight at the surface of the bronze long table, as if facing a real god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein retracts his thoughts and looks at the end of his diary:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knowing me to be' After the generalist, Mr. Chalatu said that I chose a road that is doomed to be dangerous but relatively safe in the early stage. I asked why, he just smiled and said that the hidden secrets in the serial path are much more than I imagined. I can’t help it. Ask him which sequence is the route, he told me that his sequence 9 is 'divination'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I deliberately mocked, is it everybody' The diviners are so half-hidden, never understand things? And he is obviously a high-sequence strong, and he doesn’t need to play the 'divination' anymore!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Mr. Zaratu said that this is the habit he developed from the 'divination', and only then can I evoke my curiosity and let me work with him. He hopes that I can help He stole a dangerous seal from the church of the craftsman's god, which is the relic of the Antigonus family."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Obviously, this matter must wait until I become a core member of the Artisan Church, and I asked Mr. Chalatu how long it would take to use the 'playing method' to digest the potion. , by what standard to measure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He told me that in the low sequence, as long as it can be strictly played, no more than half a year can digest the potion, the fastest It only takes a month, and the standard of measurement is very simple. Once thoroughly digested, each extraordinary person can realize it immediately, that is, it is not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I continue to ask detailed, specific situations, he laughs and does not speak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to fucking laughter without saying, wait for me to become high Strong sequence, see a 'divination' will be one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The Great, you rest in peace... Klein read it over and over again, looking away Re-investing in "justice" and "downside down":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let you wait."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is our pleasure." Audrey was shocked, but I still remember that I was an "audience." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks to the "downside down" and organizes the language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where am I going? Can you find a psychological alchemy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychological Alchemy... Klein suddenly remembered the purchase of "audience" potion aids in the underground trading market in Tingen That gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps he is a member of the psychological alchemy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein considers how to get in touch with each other, Alger Wilson shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;" Miss 'Justice', first, I don't know the clues. Second, I don't think you need to be so anxious to find a psychological alchemy. Your current focus should be on digesting the 'audience' potion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey quickly aimed at the blind person, seeing that he did not add any intentions, and was slightly disappointed: <br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just want to have plenty of time to prepare and get in touch with them more naturally, okay, then when can I digest the 'audience' potion and end the play? Is there any standard of judgment? I almost didn't have any feelings of irritability and hearing proverbs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Upside down man" Alger looked at the fool in the fog, seeing him nothing Said, so consider the opening: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't use the 'playing method', the general The principle is to wait at least three years, after confirming that there is no such thing as mania, auditory hallucination, illusion, etc., use a simple method to judge, that is, let yourself consume the limit, in this state, if you still do not hear crazy Whisper, if you don’t see strange things, it means you can be promoted.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And 'playing the law', I just contacted, I feel very good, it should not be three years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said equal to not say... three years, this too For a long time... Audrey groaned in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her thoughts just arrived, and she suddenly heard a slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey was a glimpse first, and immediately rejoicing, looking around, and surely saw the fools tapping the edge of the long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger sat seated more and waited for the fool to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's tone is as usual:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the low sequence, as long as it plays strictly, half a year It can be thoroughly digested within a month, and it is not impossible for a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks to "justice", soothingly added:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sign of thorough digestion, you will naturally understand when you don't need others to teach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One month...very good Thank you, Mr. Fool!" Audrey's joy is beyond words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Justice, don’t think that you are the son of the election, the focus is on the half year... Klein raises his right hand and puts it to his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Half-year..." Alger whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From his tone, Audrey was keenly aware of joy, reassurance, and strong doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is he wondering? Audrey thought thoughtfully: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool, do you have plans to add new members?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein relaxed and answered, and prepared to answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first is to try, there are not so many extra considerations." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But now, as a regular gathering, members must be carefully selected, and privacy is our aim."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey nodded slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, procedures such as observation, recommendation, and assessment, um, procedures."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing wrong with your understanding." Klein gave a positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mind is wondering how to ask the Secret Society and the "Clown" potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I ask for my identity? Klein was in a dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, see "Justice" for the time being, there is nothing else, Alger took the initiative to speak:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I heard that there is an Aurora's 'listener' looking for the traces of the true Creator, that is, the 'sanctuary' they preached."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real Creator?” asked Audrey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is an ancient existence shared by many mysterious organizations and hidden sects. They believe that the Creator did not die completely. The core of His remains is the true Creator. "Alger roughly explained, "Since the Fifth Age, the real creator has appeared in various images, such as 'the hanging giant', 'the shadow behind the curtain', huh, many people believe that Russell is in When the tarot card was invented, the image of the real creator was referenced, so there was a card of 'downside down'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ryan Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have no problem, Mr. Fool?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in Exploring my views on the true Creator? Klein remembered the naked man who was seen by the captain in the dream of Heinz Vansente, who was nailed to the cross, and suddenly had an idea in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter whether it is hanging or shadow, is there any evil smell? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
