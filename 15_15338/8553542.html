			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East, a corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drunken Jean faces the wall, plucks his pants, and nourishes the moss comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he solved the problem, his shoulder was suddenly shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean couldn’t help but hit a few squats, busy carrying his pants, looking around half-turned, saw a short coat wearing a canvas coat and a cap. boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "boy" raised his head, but revealed a dirty but delicate face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hugh? How did you dress like this?" Jean snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heat erected the index finger, reaching in front of the lips, indicating the other party’s ban. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she pressed the scorpion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked you to answer, whisper. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the majesty, Jean only had the idea of ​​nodding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the guys that Williams knew, who died in the last two days?" Hugh asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean carefully recalled the brain with alcohol paralyzed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Gavin! Gavin was found drowned in the Tassok River this morning!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He should have fallen last night, this poor guy does not understand Swimming, also like to go to the river to blow after getting drunk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh’s eyes are sharp and he asks if he thinks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does Gavin accept the commission of Williams to find the commission of the wanted criminal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Of course, we all got this commission from Williams. Anyway, it’s not a troublesome thing anyway. Just look at the portraits and let them know if there are any similar guys. Hey, Williams, he also said, also said, if there are clues, please drink three days of wine, eat three days of meat! This poor guy, actually died in the gas explosion So, I determined not to allow the landlord installed gas pipes! Uh ...... this is a good thing a few months ago, I am now only afford to live in cheap hotels. "Said Jean ramble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What area is Gavin responsible for? Does he have anything to mention with you?" Hugh’s side looked at his eyes, rubbing his lips and staring Asked Jean's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He, he usually went to the vicinity of the East Byron Dock in the Docklands. He also met with me on the evening of the evening, saying that it was the Workers' Union pub there. The news of finding Llanus spread out and showed the portrait of Lalhus to the people present.” Jean called a wine cellar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland has many docks, most of which are classified in the dock area and are named as various "docks". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After?? Gavin has said what he will do afterwards?" Hugh doubts frown, ask again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, of course drinking! He plans to have a good meal, then find a place to sleep! Hey, this poor guy must have been very hot, think Going to the river for a shower, I forgot that I can't swim, and it's almost winter!" Jean once again sighed with regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... Gavin didn’t find anything, that is, the Workers’ Union Pub at the East Byron Docks distributed a “flyer” to find Llanus. The result was killed, and it was implicated in Williams... The reaction of the murderer could not be described as mad, it was a madman...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change to me is Lan Ers, the best and simplest option is to change places and avoid search, unless, unless he is caught in something, he can’t leave for a long time...but it’s not just me who is looking for him. Many bounty hunters, he killed Williams and killed so many people? He has the ability to kill the West Vilas field that issued the wanted order! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, she decided to report the problems encountered to Miss Audrey first, then disguised herself to the Workers Union Tavern in East Byron Dock, not asking, just observing and seeing suspicious people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joewood District, Les Police Station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein once again huddled with a thief drunk on a bench with a backrest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s unfortunate... I’ve encountered a police check-up, I haven’t been able to change the route in time, and I’m blaming the damn serial killer! Klein cursed a guy while thinking about how to hide his spells and unexplained herbal powders and escape the next search. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to put these things in black gloves, and then found a chance to plug into the hidden place of the police station, and then retrieved when he left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, his eyes lit up, he saw his hair neatly combed, and dressed like a young lawyer, Jurgen Cooper, who was going to the party. Accompanied by a police officer came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can leave by signing a word." Jurgen said with a consistently serious expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is all right?" Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgan nodded slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, they know that you are a well-known detective ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the reason? Klein did not dare to ask, immediately got up, followed by Jurgen wearing a black long dress, not signing out quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather was different when he was taken out of the police station by the other party. There was no rain, and only the thick clouds covered the red moon and the stars. The gas street light on the side is illuminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you so much! I am bothering you again!" Klein took two steps and came to Jurgen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgan looked at him with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No thanks, this is My profession."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Klein looked carefully I glanced at each other and smiled. "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His recent wallet was very drums, and immediately took out two 1 pound denominations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgan is not polite, has received the reward:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are willing to establish a formal Cooperation, then every time I come to the police station, I only charge 1 pound. Of course, this does not include the serious case. You must understand that the fees I charge must be paid a large part to the firm."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say that I will often be invited to the police station to drink tea in the future... Hey, they don’t give tea at all, not even a cup of water! Before Klein had time to answer, he heard that Dr. Jurgen added: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For a private detective, entering and leaving the police station is a matter of time. What happened was a professional feature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I know very well that every private detective has problems with illegal guns and illegal intrusion into other people's homes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have responded very well this time. The police can't find enough evidence to prove that you have a gun, and the explanation for the gunpowder reaction on your body is quite adequate. The name of the Cragg Club is enough to win them, otherwise you are likely to have a lawsuit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, you are not a suspect, but a good citizen, Good citizens who took the initiative after handing over the guns do not need to be searched again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay...but I lost a revolver and the corresponding bullet , a few pounds, and a lawyer's fee... Klein squeezed a smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurgen twitched his mouth and reached out with a very professional smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy cooperation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I sincerely hope that I will rarely see you at the police station."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not something I can decide... Klein laughs at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to 15 Minsk Street, Klein uses hot water The way to take a bath has eased myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he once again heard the pray of Unreal cascading, faintly from women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Miss? Is there a clue to this thing about Llanus? Klein suddenly bounced from the bathtub, quickly dried his body and put on his clothes, and it entered the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the deep red star that is constantly expanding and contracting, he spreads spirituality and chooses to listen:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The fools who do not belong to this era..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Mr. Fool, the investigation of Lalus has a problem..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why the “justice” wearing a white coat slammed the explosion accident in Dalawi Street in the Eastern District and the death of Gavin’s death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a "reader" who has already started, she did not add her own guess, so as not to affect the judgment of Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening carefully, Klein frowned, feeling the reaction of the murderer was too unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is different from the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qilingus, who, as a fraudster, found that the wind and the grass are moving, and immediately shifting the place is a professional instinct. He has no reason to reversely pursue and kill the person who is looking for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to such a standard, the Eastern District’s bounty hunter will die 80%, which will cause a sensation, let the case be the night, the punisher or The heart of the mechanical team took over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well... the benefits that Lalhous got in the ritual of praying for the "real creator" to drop the son, let him go crazy? This is in line with the "real creator" style... The problem is that it is difficult for a madman to hide himself, except for the potential... Klein is thinking, not eager to respond to Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He read the newspaper and knew the explosion, so he recalled the specific content in the way of dream divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he wrote a new divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dalavi Street Explosion The clues of the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meditation, he leaned back into the chair and saw a three-story gray-blue apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third floor of the apartment had a room that lost the window and smashed half of the wall, covered with blasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture shattered quickly, and Klein woke up, tapping the edge of the long table and silently saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The clue is on the scene of the crime?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The meaning of this revelation may also be that the murderer is still staring at the crime scene and wants to solve it. The person who explored this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well...so he has a chance to find someone who recently issued a reward for Lalhous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I disguised myself to turn around in a circle, not to enter the crime scene, just turn around and see if the murderer can be found. He is not necessarily a Lanerus. The link can be used to find Llanus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, he must be hidden, how can I not get his attention? Find him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
