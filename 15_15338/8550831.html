			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you think about Klein, the more likely it is, or who will have nothing to do with the journals:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well, the area of ​​the ancient ruins of Hornachs is so unpopular, except for the corresponding lecturers and associate professors, the average fan has never heard of it, even the university graduated from the history department. The Antignus family notes only learned that... Although Tingen is a university city, there shouldn’t be too many people interested in this matter...even if there are, most of them exist on the university campus, no need Dedicated to the Devil Library to borrow..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most important thing is that the borrowed node happens to be the most recent time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This analysis is really a problem. I was not sensitive enough at the time. I didn't even think of it... Hey, it seems that I am not a detective, playing the talent of Sherlock Holmes...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s thought flashing, the owner of the “Dragon Dragon Bar” is suspected Road: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "Is there a problem? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are guests around and there is a bartender, he can only ask in general terms.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No problem, I was just thinking about how to investigate this gentleman. You know, Hainas Vansente died at home. "Klein has long been ready to speak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not want the "offenders" to be interested in the ancient ruins of the main peak of Hornachs. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Funcent is a well-known diviner in Tingen, and often comes to me. "Swein was really perfunctory and recalled. "Think carefully, the gentleman in the portrait was really coming with Fansent..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly what I want to know. Do you remember his name? "Klein immediately asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swein shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't go Ask my customer's name and identity, unless they know it, such as the old Neil. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All right. Klein deliberately showed some frustration.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, Swein knew that it was irrelevant because he could go to the Devil Library to investigate Borrowing books in this privately donated library will inevitably leave personal information, and there is still enough credibility!<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that Klein had a debit card with a letter from the senior associate professor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Even if the gentleman forged the information, there is a high probability that he will leave clues to help me divination... Klein will watch Swein go to the bar and enter the billiard room thoughtfully.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not in a hurry to go to the Devil Library to investigate, intends to complete the procurement first, after all, who can not tell, will follow the danger, there is no need to use ritual magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several rooms, Klein entered the underground trading market, at this time the booth and The guests are quite rare, and apparently have not reached the peak stage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just stepped forward and suddenly saw the "monster" who said he had the taste of death last time. Demisol stood in the corner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale face, the young man with a horrible madness in his eyes, was also aware of it and looked over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the line of sight touched, Admiral suddenly reached out and covered his face, panicked and leaned against the corner, moving step by step.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he moved to the side door and ran out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is it necessary? It’s not that the last time I almost blinded you... but I didn’t do anything... really, just like me is a big devil. Klein's expression was slightly stiff.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and didn't think about the "monster" again. He came to the booth and started to pick it up. And purchase.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half an hour later, Klein used most of the private money and used a few pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Counting the remaining 3 pounds of 17 Sule banknotes, he is distressed and satisfactorily stroking the metal bottles in the small pocket inside the black windbreaker . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the 'Amanda' pure dew used by Ms. Dai Li."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is a mixture of bark and leaves of the dragon tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The essential oil extracted from the deep sleep flower."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dried chamomile petals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the 'Sunday powder' that I have just brewed with my own material."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein recalls the contents of each small pocket over and over again, so as not to be in a hurry I was in a hurry and could not find the material I wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying on the speciality of the mysterious field, he quickly completed his memory and stepped forward to export. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw a slightly familiar figure in the corner of his eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a young lady wearing a tender green light dress, her hair is soft and shiny, her face is round, her eyes are slender, her face is sweet, her temperament Wen Wen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was the last time the body was not shaking? She looks really okay... I didn't expect her to be a occultist... Klein slowed down, thought for a few seconds, and finally remembered who the other person was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has to admit that in addition to the "justice" that does not see the appearance of the present, the young lady is the value of the girl he has seen after crossing the border. The highest one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet and gentle Wen's lady stood in front of a stall selling occult books, slightly rudely squatting down, fingers rubbing over an ancient book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient book is made of dark black hard paper, and the book is written in the book "The Book of Witches". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are black witches who record witches. Although I didn't dare to try it, some people tried it and it worked." The stall owner seized the opportunity to sell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wen Wen’s sweet lady has been indulging for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In your heart, what is the witch? What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witch? The evil person who brought disaster, disease and pain." The stall owner replied with a thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their conversation, Klein didn’t hear, because he had stepped out of the door because he was anxious to go to the Devil Library and was in a hurry to get everything done. Go home and have dinner for my brother and sister, and make tomato oxtail soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Crown Racecourse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey Hall is wearing a lambskin sleeve, ruffled, white lace dress with lace on his chest, standing in the VIP box, staring at the sprint Horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wore a gauze hat with blue ribbons and silk flowers, and gloves with light gauze gloves, her eyes were cold and alienated, as if she could not This lively occasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the occasion of the horse racing line, her friend, the priest Glylint, came together and pressed down the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Audrey, every time you see you, you have different beauty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?" Li may be immersed in the praise of the other party, but now she sees the friend's other purpose from the language and manner of Glylint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glylint, because his father died young, just inherited the title after just 20, is a slightly thin young man, he looked around and laughed道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Audrey, I met a real extraordinary person, not an extraordinary person in the royal family."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
