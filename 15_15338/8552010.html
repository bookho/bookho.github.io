Folswall repeatedly repeated it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the extraordinary, the active alarm seems to be another world thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps back and forth, I grabbed my own rough hair:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene of Khom’s death is such a horror. It’s so weird. As long as the police are still holding their eyes, they will definitely be transferred to the punitive, the night, the mechanical heart or the special department belonging to the military. At that time, we Slightly reveal some news, let them know that the murderer is Qilingus, and can create a scene of hunting in the whole city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our purpose is to find Qi Lingus, instead of catching him, with so many extraordinary 'help' things, things will be much simpler and much safer. Once Zilingers becomes confused and makes mistakes, that is our chance to win a bounty. Oh, I mean to find his trace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh and laugh twice, looking at the stunned Fols:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it in your heart, I am a person who sees obstacles and also hits? The gap between us and Qilingers is like Di The bay is so big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fols slowly points to the next line:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right Your own cognition is very correct. You have done too many similar things, so the loss is enough to get you up to the sequence 8."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately You are reasonable enough in this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hide down and look at the three-legged thorn in his hand, sinking and saying:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I must confess, I just clearly felt the death is approaching, and Zilingers is no doubt in the vicinity, it is enough evil enough to break the rules, let me instinct The reaction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls re-applied the silver bracelet with two stones left and thought for a few dozen seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree with your thoughts, first notify Miss Audrey, then call the police."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, no matter Khom found the linglings Track, or his men find that we can investigate this direction, scope of activities and place of residence prior to clarify Qilingesi. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happiness from the golden eyebrows:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Qilingers certainly not Will stay in the original place. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the seven pirate generals, and with the help of magical items, Qieringers must be cautious in Bakerland.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the "King of the Five Seas" Nast has encountered difficulties here, he was almost arrested.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No, I mean, guessing from these clues or determining the purpose of Qieringus to come to Beckland, as long as he understands what he really wants to do, no matter how he pretends to play tricks, he will eventually be exposed. In front of us, as such, our mission is completed. "Fuls explained in detail, "The experience of creating novels in these two years tells me that by grasping the key, things will become simple. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at friends from a different place, I can't believe that the other person can say such a reasonable word.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I am different from you, I am just too lazy to think, and you are thinking by muscle. "Folth licked his lips and smiled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Taking me doesn't make you smarter..." Hugh’s efforts to make himself look up The blond hair is soft and supple. "Well, let's go to Queens and tell Miss Audrey about this." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folsh sighs first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, we and Miss Audrey What is the emergency contact method? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, we have to sneak outside the luxury home of Earl Hall?" Fol's mouth twitched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep sideways, revealing a flattering smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Falth, or you Directly sneak in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think this is hard to beat you, this is your specialty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Hundreds of years of hereditary count, one of the most influential members of the House of Lords, the largest shareholder of Bhaut Bank, the fourth largest shareholder of Beckland Bank, special adviser to the Royal Bank of Lun, Susie of the Kingdom of Intis The third largest shareholder of Special Bank, the second largest shareholder of Conston Coal and Steel Complex, etc., etc. This is the prominent identity of Miss Audrey, her father, Hugh, use your brain, such a big man’s home will Didn't hire the extraordinary? There will be no private possession? This is not the same as the broken viscounts and barons!” Fols replied with no sigh, “I swear in the name of God, I just dare to sneak in, no more than five minutes. Will be found, caught."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a nod, accreditation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;"We still have to wait for that golden hair..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she led the way, took a few steps, and turned her back to the Buddha Er Sidao;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, hey, I will try to make up for your loss in the future, um, I mean the stone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Fols’s mouth tilted slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am saving myself.”< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, Hugh, you are going in the wrong direction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, if you It is an 'apprentice' and will become a 'traveler' in the future. It will be a disaster!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the luxury villa of Earl Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh and Folsch hide behind the Indus sycamore tree, quietly watching the target building, watching people come and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, they saw the golden-haired big dog sneaking out from the hidden hole at the bottom of the wall, and the ears were erected, looking left and right, very Be careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Su Shi started the walk briskly and cheerfully, there was a black male dog suddenly coming out, and it was a blessing and a circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I first knew that the dog's face could show such a humanized expression. How much does it hate that black dog?" Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sees obvious disgust from Su Shi’s eyes and facial expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls smiled and said: "It’s like a satyr that is reckless and disgusting and entangled."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing Su Shi trying to speed up, get rid of the black dog, stop standing and maintain "justice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My ruling is, leave it!" Hugh screamed with a serious expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black dog snorted, and immediately wrapped his tail, and the wolf fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su's breath sighed, slowed down, politely snorted and shook his tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good insurance, good risk, almost said to them "thank you"... Golden Retriever dog was fortunate in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenes will be very embarrassing...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melodious melody slowly stopped, and Audrey, sitting on the bench, took the latest information from Hugh and Forth, and wrinkled a good-looking brow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Qilingus is a very dangerous guy... and then continue to trace it. It is very likely that Hugh and Fols will encounter terrible things... even expose me... well, just do what they say... Yes, there are still two hours of 'Tarot Club'. I don't know what advice Mr. Fool has. If he is still not interested, I will discuss it with the hanging person carefully...” Audrey gradually calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time she has encountered, or personally involved in such a dangerous thing, there has been a human life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 pm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey, who has recovered from the deep red and the sly state, once again saw the innocent fog that is not in reality, saw the palace as if the giant residence, saw The old and mottled bronze long table saw the fool who was always covered with a thick mist, and saw the "upside down man" and "the sun." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, Audrey’s slightly tight and worried emotions were smoothed out, and her heart was so stable and so secure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am participating in the 'Tarot Club' that is not in the material world. I am facing the fool of the gods, and I am not at the same time with Qilingus. A level... Audrey proudly straightens his back, slightly lifts his chin, and greets him cheerfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Mr. Fool! Good afternoon, hanging upside down Mr. Mr. Good afternoon, Mr. Sun!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the chill, Klein saw that “Justice” indicated that she had something to say, so she gently nodded her head. , agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, don't you know that your deaf person received the compensation of 300 gold pounds?" Audrey held back and immediately told Qilin. The impulse of the Gus thing, concerned about the leader of his own leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't pay attention to this matter, but since I The leader did not ask for additional help, it should have been received."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I have confirmed it repeatedly, my account is not registered With 300 gold pounds... Klein added a quietly and cheerfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is great!" Audrey lowered her heart and turned to look opposite. "Inverted Mr., Mr. Zierlings has something to do." Progress has been made."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger is sitting right, difficult to hide his joy and ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Where is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately, we just discovered his trace, he noticed our investigation and killed the relevant personnel." Li Jinxiu and Fulth’s encounters were highlighted and explained in detail their follow-up ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger nodded slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will pay close attention."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he looked sideways at the top of the bronze long table, and looked at the "sun" Dairik, who had a gaze and couldn’t understand it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, if you understand the true purpose of Qieringus and the very important and magical item he is trying to get, please allow me to miss you. Name, tell you with a ritual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not repeatedly ask the other person’s leader for help, because since he has already said, the fool also gave a reply, then There is no need to swear, otherwise it will anger the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Alger only showed his desire to "report". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the ultimate temptation is sufficient, he believes that the leader of Mr. Fool will definitely appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can also be? Audrey's eyes widened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew that I also applied for the right to "report", so I might occasionally get the guidance of Mr. Fool... She thought with annoyance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
