			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One after another twisted, tough, harsh, totally incomprehensible words slowly spit out from Klein’s mouth, letting the bronze door’s horror suction create a hurricane Become calm, and let the surrounding environment become more and more bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, he realized that "The Hell Admiral" Ludwig’s extraordinary ability, which he had just used, was called "The Word of the Dead" and could be bypassed directly. The protection of the flesh and blood, against the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an advancement of the "Psychic" ability, raising direct, spiritual communication to a drive, or even a slavery! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language that the living creatures can't understand reverberates on the front deck, "Hell Admiral" Ludwig inevitably stands in place, his pirate ship The surface of the long-dressed body quickly emerged with a transparent part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spirit is being pulled by the power of illusion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the square black ring worn by Ludwell’s left index finger lit up a faint glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body that was forcibly dragged out a little immediately returned to the body, and the two reunited into one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;铮! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ludwell’s right hand pulled out the thin thorn that was hanging from the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is iron-black in its body, and the tip absorbs the surrounding light, turning it into a darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "Hell Admiral" slammed a step, with a violent wind, Horan pulled the distance between the two sides, the sword in his hand immediately Swift as a lightning bolt! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bronze door with its mysterious pattern still stands in its original position, and it has not disappeared because Ludwell retracted his left palm and unfolded his movements. There was a difference in the similar ability that Klein had seen before in the use of magical items that Miss Sharon had seen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black thorn sword pierced Klein in an unavoidable manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s figure quickly dried up and turned into a thin piece of paper with a yellow and crisp surface that seemed to have been weathered for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hurricane brought by the bronze gate blew through, and the paper man completely shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midair, Klein jumped out of the secluded scorpion, and he had already held a large number of spells in the field of "Poseidon". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Storm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient Greek words of the rushing mouth, the white tin flakes Burning, sacrificed himself to the "Poseidon", that is, as long as Klein is willing, he can take back most of the material and cycle it many times until the metal can no longer withstand spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue wind blade spurred out, and the surrounding sea surface swelled with the heavy waves of the cabin, because Klein didn’t try to distinguish the type of spells. At the same time that these attacks cover Ludwell, there is also a corresponding supernatural effect on the "Hell Admiral". Underwater breathing, free action, floating wind and resistance pressure have no effect at present. The influence layer after layer is superimposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lutherville suddenly opened his mouth and made a silent scream, and the waves and countless wind blades that were about to be photographed on him briefly solidified. Half empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the "Hell Admiral" raised his left hand, and the square black ring on his index finger circulated a sinister glory. Light up instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bronze door filled with an indescribable feeling swells and doubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heavy snoring, the cracks in the door are more open, and the horrible suction suddenly climbs beyond imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue wind blade, the dark waves, the half-empty Klein flocked to the door at the same time, and ran into the weird vines and arms that were slowly unfolding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was about to drive the soul of "The Priest of Light" and use the "Sacred Light" to touch the bronze door to get a chance to breathe, but saw a group of half-sized blazing fireballs flying in the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the fireball itself superimposed on the exaggerated suction generated by the gate, not far from Klein, and reached the gap of the mysterious gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blazing fire is splashing, raining down to different areas around, but only letting the bronze door that swings open a few times, faint some. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein seized the opportunity and slammed his finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few matches that were stored separately in his pocket immediately ignited, and the red flame quickly covered his body and melted away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A group of flames on the side of the bronze gate leaped and Klein jumped out from inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Anderson Hood’s gesture floating a little in the air at a glance, holding a blazing rifle in his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "strongest hunter" finally arrived, but it seems that he is not used to flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell Admiral" Ludwig looked up and saw this scene, the pale fire group in the silver-white mask eye-catching position obviously jumped twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, he did not expect the "Future", in addition to "Star above" Jia Delia, there are two pirate generals, And they all carry pretty good magic items or seals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Ludwell slammed his hand on his face and unexpectedly removed the silver mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep, pale light rushed out of the mask and let Ludwell’s left-handed index finger wear a black and dry square ring that instantly spreads endless silence. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rushed into the bronze gate, pushed it off the deck and pushed it into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This door full of mysterious patterns blends with endless silence and swells to over 30 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stands on the sea surface and stands there, just like connecting another world, different from the current world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bronze gate was steeply open, and the indescribable darkness rushed out, wrapping the front deck of the "Black Tulip". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sees it, refuses to attack, and picks up the correct spell and quickly uses it for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gust of wind came and rolled him over the "Black Tulip". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This huge sailboat drove into the bronze gate and sailed to another world ten meters and ten meters under the dark traction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell Admiral" Ludwell stood at the bow of the ship, looking up at the air, his face covered with pale light, unable to see the specific look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sight first swept through Klein and then fell on Anderson Hood, seeming to remember the two hunters, but did not try to attack again. It seems to be limited by the darkness around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson groaned, and then he did not hesitate to cast a blazing blaze in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gun went straight to Ludwell, but as soon as it entered the dark and deadly wrapped area, it disappeared silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loudeville Is this ready to escape? Really decisive... Klein was a glimpse, and immediately remembered that the Aziz copper whistle was still on the "Black Tulip". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the huge sailboat has nearly passed the bronze gate and entered another world, and there is no way to stop it. Klein throws a match and flies. The floor slammed a ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go into the back deck of the 50-meter range, next to the Azick copper whistle that is constantly changing hands between the undead creatures who are pulling each other, tied to it The match together hoisted and ignited a red flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the flames, Klein's figure emerged there, and the explorer caught the Aziz copper whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his preparation for recycling copper whistle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in order to prevent accidents, that is, the match was caught by the undead creature, he also painted a layer of flammable sun essential oil on the surface of the copper whistle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the encirclement of countless dead spirits, Klein had no time to recover the hand that grabbed the copper whistle, and immediately hit the ring again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a palm that is only transparent or rotten or pale or illusory has caught him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The match that Klein had thrown before was ignited in the air and leaped out of a fluent stream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His figure quickly emerged in this group of fires, but his face turned blue and his lips turned white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean, who was caught by countless shadows, grievances, and other undead creatures, feels cold in the depths of the spirit and is difficult to control. Living in the body, plopping down and falling into the sea that has been heavily dyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——With the “Black Tulip” basically driving through the bronze gate, the sea surface that was like the entrance to Hell has returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sank a few meters, and the sea that had been suffocated and bitter and awkward finally eased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, I was prepared... full of thoughts, he suddenly felt wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fisherman's cuffs, he has 10 minutes of passive underwater breathing ability, should not be drowning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slammed his head and looked at the wrist, only to see that the blue sleeves had disappeared from the organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lost... Lost by the "Tinder" glove... I just stayed on the "Black Tulip"... Klein thumped a few times, floating Out of the water, I saw the tail of the huge sailboat blending into the darkness, and the bronze door slowly closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He instinctively swam a few meters and finally stopped, picking one out of the remaining spells, adding a special effect of underwater breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson Hood in the midair sees this scene and secretly swears: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy Really crazy...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still want to chase! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "Future" has fallen on the stars and condensed into a long bridge, which has been extended.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Star above" Jia Delia finally solved the previous gray monster with strong vitality!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, "Hell Admiral "has hesitated again, it is better to run away in time... Anderson silently sighs and falls steadily on the Star Bridge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the Germans Paro flew, he was about to say hello, praised the other side, but saw a cold and silent face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson intuitively avoided , laughed twice, letting Greman Sparo cross himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to the "Future" along Star Bridge, Klein has converged After living in various emotions, I saw Frank Lee greet him and put a vertical thumb on himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the most crazy I have ever seen in my life. Guy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You dare to board the 'Black Tulip' alone, single-handedly 'Hell Admiral', and still alive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, on madness, I am far worse than you... Klein responded silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, many pirates with long hair or pontoon have expressed their surprise and admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this atmosphere, Klein closed his eyes and felt that the "No Face" potion was completely digested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
