			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rather spacious living room, Anna and Joyce, who ended the hug, sat on different sofas, separated by the woman’s parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce sighs with satisfaction:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steam is on, how much I am Fortunately, I can come back alive and see Anna again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My poor Joyce, what happened to you?" Anna couldn't stand it anymore. , to explore the road with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce looked at his fiancee and looked heavy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am today I still feel scared and always wake up from my dreams again and again. Five days after leaving the port of Caesar, we encountered pirates and terrible pirates. The only thing to be thankful for is that their leader is Nast."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The big pirate who calls himself the 'King of the Five Seas'?" Mr. Wayne, the father of Anna, asked with horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Joyce had come to visit half an hour ago, he never mentioned his own experience in detail, and he was cringed, embarrassed and upset until Anna When I came back and gave a hug, he seemed to really get out of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, 'King of the Five Seas' Nast declares that he is a descendant of the Solomon Empire and abides by the virtue of not killing prisoners. Because of this, we Just being robbed of money, and not losing his life, his men even gave us enough food." Joyce recalled this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body gradually trembled, but still insisted on describing the deepest and deepest nightmare:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I lost a lot of property, I thought that the bad luck had passed, but in the following voyage, the passengers and crew of the nickname broke out of fierce guilt, from disputes to fighting, and then To pull out the revolver, bring up the straight sword, kill each other... In those few days, my eyes are full of blood, and the people around me fall down one after another, licking the eyes that will never close, the limbs, heart and intestines Spilled all over the floor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We don't want to be a beast, that is, the part of reason, there is no place to escape, no road to escape, surrounded by The deep blue waves are the oceans that can't see the margins... Some people cry, some ask for mercy, some sell their bodies, but their heads are still hung on the mast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Anna, I was desperate, thinking that I will never see you again, lucky. Yes, in such a nightmare, there are still heroes. The captain led us to hide in the sturdy lower layer. With the prepared water and food prepared in advance, we reached the limit of those crazy guys. Mr. Tries encouraged us to take the lead. , led us to attack the group of murderers..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a bloody battle I will never forget, we survived, but the nickname also deviated from the channel The sailor is only one-third of the original."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the most horrible and darkest side of the human heart, Joyce couldn't help but recall the "hero", who claimed to be the hero of Tries. He has a round, harmonious face, a character, like a girl, always likes to be In the corner, only people who are very familiar with him can understand how he is a talkative person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is such an inconspicuous boy, standing firmly in front of everyone in the worst and most desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, steam is on, my poor Joyce, you have a distressing experience, thank God, worship God, He let us not Separation." Anna's eyes were tearing in the eyes, constantly pointing out the triangular steam and mechanical emblem on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce reveals a slightly pale smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is our devout return The nickname later experienced the storm, experienced the trek, passed the test again and again, and finally arrived at the port of Enmat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the ship happened After such a serious bloody case, our survivors were controlled by the police and interrogated separately. They did not have the opportunity to report to the family. When everything was over, this morning, I immediately borrowed money from a friend and returned by steam train. Thank God, let me re-enter the land of Tingen and let me see you again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anna, when you see me, I can feel your joy and surprise, but what I can't understand is, after you got out of the carriage, why did you rush to the door so excitedly, oh, I was going to give you a big surprise. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna recalls the previous experience, still can't believe the way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No What needs to be concealed, Joyce, because of worrying about you, I went to the only divination club in Tingen today to divination, and the diviner, no, the diviner told me that he said that your fiancé has returned. It’s in a house with a toy windmill.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What?” Wayne and Joyce blurted out at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny squinted and shook her head and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't believe what I met today. Things, but it does happen, steam is on, maybe there is a miracle in this world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joyce, the diviner wants you The name, characteristics, address and date of birth, said to be a divination, then asked me, there is a toy windmill is my home, or your home, waiting for me to confirm, he said, congratulations, Miss Anna, you The fiancé is back, just in your home, don't ask him about his experience, give him a hug and comfort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God..." Joyce I only felt that this thing was unimaginable and difficult to understand. "Does he know me? Did someone send him a telegram? Is he familiar with the police in the port of Enmat? No, this is still unexplained. How does he know that I am going? Is your family coming? How can he be sure that you are going to divination? Have you made an appointment in advance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I was temporarily chosen. "Anna looked at a loss to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe a good diviner needs to have a wealth of information, even if it is not used for a short time, maybe divination is really magical." Anna's father Mr. Wayne sighed and concluded, "In the more than a thousand years of history, and in the less clear Quaternary, divination has always existed and never disappeared. I think there is definitely a reason."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce squinted slightly and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the diviner's name?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna thought about the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein Moretti."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the reception hall of the Divination Club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Klein controlled the volume, Angelica also didn’t know how to close, so she only saw Anna lose her soul and only saw the other’s expression Shocked and confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika walked closer to the sofa and curiously asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A good The result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not dare to ask what the specific result was, fearing that the potential rules of the diviners were violated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Klein nodded and took three coins from his trouser pocket. "One-eighth of a Sule is one and two. One penny?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." An Jielika looked at the copper coin and found that one was 1 pence, two were half pennies, and quickly retreated. "More than half a penny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiles and presses:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you For the care of my guests, she gave me a tip, and I should have given you a tip."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a thank you for your recommendation...He silently filled it up One sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." An Jielika was a little bit afraid of Klein. If she saw the reason, she would not refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein returned to the conference room and thought there would be more inquiries in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
