			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amon... Klein read the word in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally thought that the "God of the Gods" that appeared in the "God of Abandonment" Silver City is a descendant of the ancient family of Amon, by inheriting the legacy of the ancestors Step by step to the semi-god level, who knows, the other party is likely to live more than two thousand years, is the most prosperous member of the Amon family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old antiques...has he nothing to do for himself to build a mausoleum? Is there a reason for the death to die, such as the traces of the time left in the body? Can he live from the Quaternary to the Fifth Age, relying on the plundering of the lives of others? I originally guessed that he is sequence 3, sequence 2, and today, sequence 1 is not impossible. Long time will always bring about an essential improvement... Klein sometimes wonders and sometimes speculates that his thoughts are like boiling water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doll" Holamik pulled his throat and accidentally pulled off a piece of skin, revealing an extremely complicated mechanical structure inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice was heard from that location, with a bit of air leakage:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You search for the bodies on the ground, don't get close to here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Lord Archbishop!" Icons and others were obviously relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpses on the ground have long condensed extraordinary characteristics, and some even combined with a certain part of the body to form a magical item that makes people panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the deceased carry a variety of things with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The heart of the machine" is not a small gain, plus the "ghost frame" and "human skin shadow characteristics" obtained before, completely compensated The overhead of crazy "washing the ground"... big investment in exchange for high returns... Kline’s gaze lingered on the ground for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a breath and raised his gaze, followed by the "dolphine" Horamick, who did not mention the lantern, to the other side of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Mirror Arrods pleasedly brightened the picture and made the things ahead clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw the opposite wall appearing a large patch of mottled due to the rapid "weathering", many murals were destroyed and could no longer be restored to their previous appearance. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only one that is relatively complete, can barely see clearly, the colored murals are at the top of the wall and occupy a small dome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It describes a winding mountain range, on the highest main peak, erecting a huge cross that is taller than the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cross is covered with layers of brilliance, which is unusually sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a majestic figure in front of it, and the mountain is like a pet at his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure is surrounded by angels with two wings, four wings and six wings. They either carry a horn, play a harp, or blow The flute looks pious and cheerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below the mountains, two angels with twelve wings, each holding a baby, walked humbly to the top of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby on the left has a slightly curled black hair, and the one on the right has a light gold hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have a black eye and a golden voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other places in the mountains, vaguely depicting giants with chains, chains that are tied to their feet, and never reach the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holamic first looked at the baby on the left, and the expression of Cihe became more and more dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pronounced a very low and very light word:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amon." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he turned to look at the baby on the right, silent for a few seconds before spitting out a name:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Adam..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amon, Adam... Klein repeated these two names and felt that the fog over the Quaternary and Tertiary history became more and more intense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made some guesses in his heart in combination with the various messages he had heard:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the top of the mountain, the figure in front of the radiant cross is surrounded by angels. There are giants and dragons surrendering. It is definitely the true God who represents the sequence 0. Another one who loves to use the cross as a symbolic part is the "real creator"... It is rumored that the original Amon was a descendant of the ancient sun god, but the top of the mountain was not like a pure sun god...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the one believed by Silver City "Create the Lord of all, the omnipotent God"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in line with the myths and legends of the Silver City, the creator awakens, depriving the "king of the giant", "the dragon of fantasy" and other descriptions of the ancient gods...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called ancient sun god is actually the owner of Silver City who created everything? He may have mastered the fields of "the sun" and "time". In addition, the "giant king" Olmer, the "dream dragon" Angelweed's authority should also return to him...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, this cannot be covered with the sequence 0...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the original Amon was the Silver City The descendants of "the Lord who created everything, the omnipotent God" inherited the extraordinary characteristics of the time domain? This seems to explain a little bit of his quiet stay in the Silver City dungeon for decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to him, "the God who created everything, the omnipotent God" has a descendant, called Adam...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did the original Adam inherit, whether there are descendants alive, and if there is, where will it be...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real Creator" and that What is the relationship? Simply imitating each other, using the title of the Creator and the symbol of the cross? Or is there a deep connection between the two? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t let his doubts reveal too much, after all, the mirror Arrodes might be looking at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horamik stared at the mural for a while, suddenly stepping forward, sticking out his palms and pressing on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the magnificent murals disintegrated, turned into pieces of stone, and even the colors evaporated and dissipated quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church of the God of Steam and Machinery is consciously covering up the history of the Tertiary and Quaternary... Is this the same for other churches? Klein frowned and followed the "Doll" Horamick to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a half circle, they found out again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stone door that outlines only Hidden in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the "Doll" Holamick's joints have been continuously creaking, but this did not prevent it from approaching Shimen quickly. Stretch out your right hand and try to push. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the stone gate, there is a floating of water, which condenses a scene that seems to be able to touch directly:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep blue waves rushed forward in a wave, and there was a strong black mist that seemed to be liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sturdy mountain stretches out of the fog and continually flows down the mucus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the mountain, the black mist is boundless and you can't see the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no limit at the bottom of it. The deeper it is, the more it feels secluded. It seems that once something falls, it will always fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is this? Klein groaned in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holamic retracted his palms and watched the scene fade away until it disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head back, half confused and whispered to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Abyss..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abyss? That is the source of all fallen, it is said to corrode the abyss of the true God? Klein was quite upset, but he used to be a "clown" who kept his face and body in good condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately thought of one thing, Russell who explored the foggy sea once deviated from the channel, and then left a confusing discourse:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw it Abyss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein reminisced about the waves that flowed into the black fog, with a speculative speculation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is an abyss entrance somewhere in the foggy sea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he looked again at Shimen, doubting the one that had been seen in Silver City. After using a certain ritual, Amon did not leave normally after the tomb. Instead, he went to the abyss with a special passage, so in the eyes of most people, he has really passed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for whether Silver City or "The Land of God" is in a certain place in the abyss, Klein cannot be sure. After all, the history of this tomb is at least a thousand. For more than five hundred years, Amon has ample time to travel to the abyss and go to other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does he still come back occasionally and take time? If I find that my grave has been dug up, the expression on my face must be wonderful... Klein is somewhat happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, "Doll" Holamick grasped his left hand with his right hand and jerked it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his voice, his left hand folded down, but there was no bone to break the skin, with bleeding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of his left wrist is inlaid with a black cold heavy metal tube! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His left arm is a small-caliber mysterious artillery! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a “mechanical heart”, hiding a mole of black technology, but this kind of thing is too high, too expensive, obviously only available to specific Staff, can not be equipped with the army... Klein feels that today is an eye-opener, and fortunate enough to see another mysterious world of development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is that the extraordinary characteristics are conserved, the "craftsman" is limited, and many things cannot be mass produced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doll" Holamick resisted the stone door with his left wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of his teeth biting and turning in his body, and a strong spiritual brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A touch of white light shines and disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone door has become a pure powder, as if it never existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have, ruined the door? If the Auntie Amon encounters an emergency and tries to return here, he finds that he can't open the door, so it's fun... Klein imagined the scene and almost laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the exploration of the Amon family's mausoleum, the picture around Klein has shrunk rapidly and turned into a background. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An illusory ancient strange silver mirror emerges in the air, and the black gems on both sides of the eyes are shimmering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White words quickly outlined in the mirror:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your faithful servant Arrods report Finished, and always ready to serve you again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this too enthusiastic guy, Klein could have been a little vigilant and uncomfortable, and sighed first: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, let's leave first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, above the spiritual world Great existence." After the words of Arrodes emerged, the scenes around them were completely broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After confirming that its power has left its dreams, Klein thoughtfully said to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The great existence above the spiritual world? It does faintly detect the fog...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This evil mirror really wants to trust me. Or is there another purpose? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be careful to observe and observe, and, in the 'Mechanical Heart', I don't want to be covered by gunfire for three rounds..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
