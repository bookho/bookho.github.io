			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is fierce in the sky, the sea is golden, and in addition to these, there are countless illusory black lines in Kline’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not far from the mermaid, from his own body, from different places in the nearby sea, stretched out, small and numerous, dense, corresponding to different The part, and spread to infinity, arrived at the end of the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very intensive and beautiful scene. It is no stranger to Klein. He borrowed the power of "All Black Eyes" and relied on it for a long time. When the other person shapes the dummy of the "world", he can see a similar picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the source of the extraordinary ability of the "Master of Secrets"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knowledge gained from the potion tells Klein that these illusory black lines are called "the line of the spirit", which can directly influence the spirit of the target by manipulating them. Body, astral body, mental body, and etheric body, then use the "Ether Body" bridge to control the other's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, all the extraordinary abilities of the "Master of Secrets" are on the "Line of Spirituality". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to use the "spirit of the spirit" that exists in every creature to find hidden targets, "witches" stealth and "hidden monks" The nemesis of the shadow hiding ability, of course, Klein is not sure whether there is a way to cover up the "line of the spirit." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is to control the target like a puppet, so that his mentality is slow and the body is stiff and stagnation. This is forced control, it is difficult to have the ability to confront, basically can only rely on The strength of the spirit of the spirit to get rid of, for the "secret master" who is already at the level of sequence 5, there is almost no need to worry about under the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is that after the passage of time, the control is deepened, and the "Master of Secrets" can completely turn the goal into its own embarrassment, hiding within a certain distance. Behind the scenes, manipulating the other side to fight, in this way, you can use the original extraordinary ability! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really bizarre, mysterious, terrible, it is the exclusive behind the scenes, it is no wonder that Rosago said that the manipulation on the line of the spirit is high. One of the most difficult abilities in the sequence...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it takes time, and control can be completely achieved without a single step. It must be deepened step by step to final completion. For initial control, I will take about 20 seconds in the current state, but with the gradual digestion of the potion, the time will be significantly shortened. After the 'Master of Secrets' is thoroughly digested, it may be within 5 seconds, um, in effect. Before, the goal is almost undetectable, and it may be possible to have some predictive ability...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once the initial control of the target's 'spiritual line', he will Immediately, the slow thinking, the stagnation of the movement and the stiffness of the body, and then step by step toward the puppet, the development of the shackles, if the 'Master of the Secret Master' has a companion, in this process, you can easily solve the forced control Goal, um, if the enemy’s spiritual strength is not too The 'Master of Secrets' has a certain amount of effort, and can even distract the guns or use magical items to match themselves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the process of control is not outside The power is interrupted. After five minutes, the goal will become my embarrassment. In a sense, he has really died and things can no longer be reversed. When the potion is completely digested, the time required for conversion will definitely be greatly shortened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The maximum limit I can currently manipulate is one, but I can't judge it for the time being, but it will definitely grow, and the upper limit does not seem to exceed three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to the time and distance limitations, I can only see the 'spirit line' within 100 meters, and want to manipulate them Must enter the corresponding target within 5 meters...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When maneuvering, the distance between the body and it can not exceed 100 meters temporarily, and then it can certainly grow.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, in addition to retaining its extraordinary ability, it can also use magical items and seals, and consumes its spirituality, not mine. Of course, the act of manipulating it itself is very spiritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This ability is very suitable for me, in the case of very dangerous and has to be explored, you can let it go, although it will be very painful to lose it, but It’s better than my own death on the spot, huh, huh, the 'secret master' Rosago came to deal with me, there must have been other actions, so that there is no such thing, um, he certainly has not completely digested the 'secret master' magic Medicine, so, I can't wait to open the door, I can only control me in the face-to-face conversation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am really looking forward to it. I don't know what kind of qualitative change will happen to the sequence 4 with so many wonderful powers. Oh, I don't know what its name is..." Klein ended his inspection of his own situation. Feeling a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately relied on the experience of setting the method of opening and closing for "Lingshi", and constrained the ability to see the "line of the spirit", so as not to see The thing that should be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left thumb is the first joint of the index finger to open twice, repeat it again, the right hand can also... He withdraws his thoughts, looks forward, sees the remaining few The mermaid has turned and is curiously looking at him with his blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that without their singing, there is no simple ritual, they have just lost control and become a seal like "2-049", Klein friendly They smiled at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mermaid is affected by the power of the spell, and also gently licks his lips, revealing a slightly shy smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With them or pale purple or crimson lips open, Klein saw their teeth: sharp as a spike, one by one, white Sensen, swaying, dripping a viscous liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein stunned and found that it was harder to accept than the real monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was already prepared to see that the mermaid is the kind in the sewer, so no matter how horrible the madness of the other side, he thinks he can bear it. Live, but the situation is somewhat unexpected. The mermaids are clearly beautiful and attractive women, the tail has a different sense of beauty, and the teeth are so disgusting, this contrast is too vivid, so Klein can not bear to look straight, almost Remove your eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he waved his hand, he quickly took out the spell of the "Poseidon" field, made a strong wind again, and pushed the boat back to the "Future". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, Klein couldn't help but recollect the feeling just now:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The song of the original mermaid is A kind of neutralization, a kind of balance, otherwise the vast majority of 'faceless people' can't resist the corruption of the 'secret master' potion on their own 'spirit line', they will lose control directly, huh, sea snake Cavi diagram This kind of lucky child is not in the scope of discussion. Perhaps it is because there is no ritual assistance, it will be relatively weak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In theory, as long as there is a similar The sound of the effect or the extraordinary ability can replace the song of the mermaid, but the person who has not experienced it personally can't distinguish the subtle difference. Therefore, it is not the high sequence of the 'divination' approach, it is difficult to provide effective Suggest. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of thought, the boat returned to the "Future", and Klein used the ropes to easily reach the deck.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson Hudley is on the edge of the ship's side, hehe laughs: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original mermaid is a ritual need, not to get the corresponding materials. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is very clear. Klein responded briefly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson shrugged his shoulders:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no Clearly, normal people will guess that the mermaid is the material you need, because this does not match the ritual of Sequence 4, but who knows, the pirate general-level adventurer Gelman Sparo has only sequence 6. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is "only"? Klein resisted the impulse to manipulate Anderson's "spiritual line."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't pay attention to the strongest hunter with his own aura, he enters the cabin and is ready to return to his room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just approaching the captain's room,吱The voice came, and the door opened in front of his eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The star above will" Jia Delia did not wear the heavy glasses, the dark purple inside the scorpion Slightly sullenly looking at German Sparrow Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Congratulations on your promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before, in the previous dream, did I say something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
