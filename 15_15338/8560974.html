			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you like to use a stone and Lemano travel notes for a period of time? How does he know that I have these two items? I remember that I didn't mention it at the Tarot meeting... After hearing the reply of the "world" German Sparrow, Fols was surprised and shocked. It seems that all the secrets have been seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very strong in her spirit, and quickly recalls where she is missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides the teacher, Hugh, and 'fool', no one knows that I have these two items, especially Lemano’s travel notes, I have nothing to do. Used... 'Mr. Fool'... Forever, Mr. World has some strange performances at the Tarot Conference. He never submitted a diary of Russell the Great. In this respect, it seems that he is not at all worried, nor worried... He has a deep connection with Mr. 'fool' and got the corresponding information from him? Believers, or prostitutes?" Fols thought for a while, vaguely grasped something, no longer as fearful as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until then, she had the energy to consider whether the "world" German Sparrow's request was acceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Firth, such a price is simply too cheap, less than she expected, and reasonable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a peculiar person who often does not go out to write a manuscript at home, leasing Le Mano’s travel notes for a while does not affect his or her safety. Use, and that string can help her shuttle the bracelet of the spirit world, there are two stones, send one to the "world" German Sparrow will not let her completely lose the card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is that Mr. "World" seems to be willing to try only once. If it fails, he will still ask for the reward... well, with the risk he needs to bear. In fact, this is normal... I thought I needed to do a lot of things for him, and I used the traitor’s head in exchange for rewards to pay back the debts... Foer thought for a few seconds and did it to Mr. Fool. Prayed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Please tell Mr. World, I accept his conditions and will try his best to cooperate with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She originally wanted to remind the world "German Sparo" that the use of that stone would give the sequela of the full moon slang, but it suddenly became apparent that only the "apprentice" approach was extraordinary. Only have such treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of success or failure, with that stone, I can Quietly leave Beckland, meet with the "inverted man" and explore the original island... When you use the stone to record with the magic book, you don't have to worry about it, unless the luck is too bad. The record failed... Klein quietly breathed a sigh of relief, opened the door, and let the personal maid Richardson come in to help him organize his clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. After breakfast, your scheduled trip is to go to the Kingdom Museum to see the royal collection." Richardson helped the employer put on his coat, while Say the arrangement today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the social dance steps of Daun Dontes are progressing very fast, so the morning etiquette class has dropped from three times a week to three times, giving him extra time. Do other things, and similar exhibitions will inevitably become hot topics in the upper circles. If you don’t look at them personally, it will not be decent enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for going to the St. Seychelles church to listen to the bishops, Klein also consciously reduced the frequency, not because they have to donate dozens of pounds each time. It is worried that after the beginning of the fresh period, going too often will be suspicious. Nature and rationality are the core elements of his plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He plans to randomly choose two days outside the rest of the day, relying on a longer period of time to accumulate intelligence, find out the law, not in a hurry, not to worry ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't wait." Kline looked at the temperament of himself in the mirror, and smiled and said to the close-fitting man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the Church of Saint-Saill and the Church of the Night, he naturally recalls Leonard Mitchell’s secret investigation of Sherlock Moriatti’s Things don't understand what the other party is suspecting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the case that Emlin White’s door-to-door purchase of “fire” gloves has led Leonard’s decision to investigate the people around him, or the Kapin case, Llanus The looming figure of the big detective in the case made the red gloves responsible for the investigation aware? Or both? Klein thought about the traces he had left, and there was roughly speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even if I found out, there is nothing. I am not the original "clown" or "magician". I don't want to find my demigod. It is not one or two. Even with the senior deacon of the church, the problem will not change qualitatively. ...and Benson and Melissa are real ordinary people. The church will definitely not involve them and will not disturb their lives... I don’t know if I will withdraw the pension, it should not, it can’t be done. Explain to ordinary people... Klein’s debt is more and more unthinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is when he heard the "Silver Snake" Will Unsetin’s identity as his Klein Moretti’s identity last night. So the reason for the calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sequence of 1 angels who have had contact with Sherlock Moriatti for a long time and are good at fate-related abilities, how could you not find this big? Where did the detective originate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if there is a fog barrier that interferes with a lot of details, Will Unsetin can certainly know that Sherlock Moriarty belongs to Tingen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While in Tingen, Klein had a teenager who had contacted a "monster" route, let the other person's eyes bleed, "The Snake of Destiny" "Where Willingen mastered this information, the two sides compare, the answer comes out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Leonard really finds out the hidden identity of Sherlock Moriatti, I don’t know what kind of expression... Klein laughs and walks out Master bedroom, down to the second floor, enjoy the breakfast prepared by your own chef. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western District, 2 King’s Road, Kingdom Museum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein entered the inside with the butler Walter and the close-fitting servant Richardson through the ticket gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exhibition was hosted by the Lun royal family. They brought various historically significant collections to the outside world for the public to watch and understand to enhance the kingdom. The people respect and recognize the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a graduate of the history department, Klein is still very interested in this exhibition, and many events he is very familiar with have corresponding items here. From another angle, people are immersed in the long and fascinating past years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Klein a little surprised is that the butler Walter has an in-depth understanding of most of the exhibits, very detailed for Dawn Dontes. Introduction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not for the aristocratic family... Klein secretly nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk and stop to see, the three people continue to meet other visitors, and the entire exhibition hall is quiet and orderly, only whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing through a showcase, Klein found that the butler's footsteps suddenly paused, and he looked aside and his expression became quite complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it wasn’t the “audience,” Klein couldn’t interpret the specific meaning of that complex emotion, and could only look at Walter’s gaze and look in front of the showcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people standing there, one man and one woman, the man in his thirties, wearing a black formal suit, wearing a silk top hat, holding a gold cane, looks like a bit The rich gentleman, the woman's yellow dress, wearing a gold necklace, the overall dress is gorgeous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Guan Jia looked at the man... Klein made a judgment in an instant, and his eyes swept through the target without any trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that the gentleman was old, his skin was often exposed to the darkness of the sun, the back of his hand was like dried wood, and his fingers were extremely rough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t look at your clothes and say that he is a farmer, a gardener, or a driver, I believe... Klein’s eyes are back, and there is some confusion in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was able to notice these details because he seriously considered a long-term adventure in the South when he built the identity of Dawn Don. What kind of appearance should ordinary people have? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that in the eyes of the rich experience, the temperament and the innate facial features, Dawn Dontes must have long-term exposure to the sun. The skin, the less conspicuous scars, the rough and powerful palms and other details, otherwise it is not enough to support the inside of this character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
