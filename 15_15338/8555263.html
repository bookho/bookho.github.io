In addition to the bathroom, each place is covered with a thick gray-yellow carpet, and a well-known wall is hung on the wall. Imitation of oil painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence breathed a sigh of relief:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Miss Wall, please forgive one. The dead can't be saluted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Mr. Lawrence, your problem has been alleviated. As a former practicing physician, I can tell without question. You, you can still live, wait for a break, we go to the clinic or hospital." Fols comforted each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence smiled and said: "My physical condition is very clear to me. You don't need to comfort me, and my amateur is a astrologer. I have already felt me." Will die in Beckland and die in this hotel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the surface modification, he said all the truth, he himself is nearly eight Ten, it was not the young man who was a strong spirit. If the non-sequence potion brought about a certain physical improvement, he might have been buried in which cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Lawrence felt that he could still live for ten years. Who knows that he had suffered a rebellion from the former "traveler" Buttis, and he was in the hands of the Aurora More serious injuries, all his remaining children and grandchildren died in the disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gave him a great blow, and he almost couldn’t slow it down, but to Beckland’s search for the actions of the two brothers and their descendants, The result of the other party’s dying has been harvested, and his spirit has once again caused some trauma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of things add up, Lawrence clearly feels that his life has come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His original intention was to go to the tomb of Lauboro and Anlisa to present a bunch of flowers, then return immediately, meet other members of the Family Presbyterian Church, and explain the aftermath But the situation of the elderly people, really can't say it will not work soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the opening of Fulth, Lawrence struggled to remove a palm-sized notebook from the inside pocket of the semi-open garment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notebook's hard paper case is copper-green, giving a very old feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s surface is written in ancient Fussac: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw, I recorded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence put the notebook on the quilt on his chest and took a breath:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Wall, if I am here, can you help me send it to Port Pritz?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lawrence Sir, you won't have anything to do," Fols emphasized. At the same time, she subconsciously took a look at the notebook and found that it was not thick. There were three kinds of paper inside, one of which was baked and crispy. Yellow, the quantity is very rare, a parchment like a tan, the quantity is medium, one is the ordinary white paper, the largest number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence smiled very hard and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean, if, Ms. Wall, Would you help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pritzport is not far away, even travel is not considered, if you need to hurry, in the case of steam trains, I can even go back and forth for a long time." Fols nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence is relieved, and the spirit seems to have recovered a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After I die, you wait Ten minutes, I took a glowing item from my body and sent it along with this note to Dorian Gray of the Pritzker Fishermen's Association. My wallet and the 42 pounds of cash inside were I will give you the reward and thanks, my clothes will accompany me to become ashes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence didn’t seem to hear what she was saying. She said to herself: “Many Ryan will give you some other rewards, but it depends on your own thoughts... I believe in you, from the things of Anlisa. I can see that you are a good girl..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly woke up and said to Foll:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Wall, can you go to the first floor to give me a bottle of water? The waiter doesn't know when to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem. "Folth didn't think too much, took the boiling water bottle and walked out of the room." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps, she suddenly felt wrong because the water bottle in her hand was heavy and obviously had a lot of inventory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls is about to return and ask, suddenly aware of the strong spiritual fluctuations in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...Falth first squatted there, and immediately understood Mr. Lawrence’s intentions:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As death approaches, he clearly feels that his physical state is starting to be wrong, fearing that he will lose control and become a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to die as a human being, not a monster, so he chooses to end his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last decent of an extraordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if you become a monster, all his arrangements will be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Fols stunned for a while, waiting outside for nearly ten minutes before pushing the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw Lawrence lying on the bed without a sound, as if she was a lot older, with an eye-sized "diamond" beside her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light from the window shines in and refracts on the "diamond", forming a beautiful scene like a star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call...Fuls breathed a sigh of relief and checked it carefully, discovering that Lawrence’s death was the most common cardiac arrest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joewood District, 15 Minsk Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back home, Klein took a break and went over the fog, planning to divinate Will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let the thousand paper cranes fly out of the corner of the debris pile, landed on the bronze long table in front of him, and then took off the entanglement of the cuffs Citrine pendant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While holding the pendulum in the left hand, Klein adjusted his state with meditation and recalled the scene that he saw in the woods outside the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some details that he may not have noticed, but his spirituality will certainly not be overlooked. This divination is mainly to use this point and rely on the fog to eliminate interference. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the preparations, Klein presented a new parchment and wrote the "Divination Statement":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will. Onsetin has died completely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he pressed the paper crane to the divination statement, let the citrine The pendant almost touched the words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the meditation state, after completing all the steps of the "spiritual spelling", Klein opened his eyes and looked at the result:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citrine pendant is rotating counterclockwise, the speed is quite fast, the range is not small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means negation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that Will Ansett is not completely dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... Klein feels awkward and feels that this seems to be expected.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The body is Will. Anthony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the spirit of the pendulum gave a positive revelation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body does belong to Will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein vaguely had an idea to write a new divination statement again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The body of Ernestine will be resurrected.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a calm and busy day, Klein saw the revelation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;counterclockwise rotation, very fast.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that Will's body will not be resurrected, that is, it will not change!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Will. Anthony actively or passively abandoned the previous body and survived in another way... this thing and the "Silver of Mercury" About Klein tried other divination content, but all failed, including "The current state of Will." He repeated the previous divination with "Dream Divination" and asked "Will. Onsetin's current position" and still got a similar picture: the dark room, the slap of the sound of water.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;But it feels a little different.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget it, no need to waste time, I am not ready to blend... Ryan put away his spirits and prepared to return to the real world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the divination and the previous things, he had a vague guess about Will. But can't confirm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suspects that Will Ansett is another "silver snake"!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As sequence 1, "Silver of Mercury" is not unique, and there can be up to three "strips" at the same time!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Silver Snake" Naturally, it is possible to locate the position of the Allen Star Spirit through a thousand paper cranes, create false revelations to each other, and undoubtedly have the ability to change one's fate.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will. Anthony does not know why it is weak, is suffering the second "silver snake" threat, everything he does is to get rid of each other<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the reason for the conflict between them, the answer is simple:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is no sequence 0, There can be three sequences of 1 at the same time, and once there is a sequence of 0, there will be no sequence 1! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this sentence, the formula of the "Black Emperor" potion illustrates the true meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main materials of the recipe is:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two "princes of the order" Extraordinary features! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Order of the Prince" is the sequence of the "Black Emperor" route! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a sequence 1, in order to promote the sequence 0, you must get all the extraordinary features of the other two sequences of the same route! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with such speculation that Klein is increasingly afraid to blend into Will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my inference is correct, it is a genuine "fair fight", can not afford to provoke ... Klein spirituality fell, disappeared Inside the ancient palace above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens, a house that is not worth seeing here, The extraordinary gathering of Mr. A was held as scheduled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fols and Hugh changed their body harnesses, accompanied by the priest of Glylint wearing an iron black mask, and found a position to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
