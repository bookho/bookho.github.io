			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great probability... Klein manipulated the "world", gloomy and low-smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, I don't really have the potion formula of the 'Wind', and I can't find a way to get it in a short time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I There is a broken formula of the sequence 4 potion on hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it is broken, I think you should be very clear about its value, it can at least exchange 10,000 gold pounds, and most of the time, the double the price of the premium can not be bought, this is a key step in the qualitative change of human beings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, are you interested? The value of the spinal fluid of the evil-skinned panther is between 500 and 700 pounds. The medulla of the Elven Fountain crystallizes between 300 and 400 pounds. I think you need to prepare an extra 9000 pounds of cash or equivalent. Items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had long guessed that the "sun" route sequence 4 "no dark" can be compared with the "sailor" route, "readers The same way The sequence is interchanged, and this speculation has been confirmed side by side from Mr. A's request and Russell's diary, and even extends the suspicion that the "secret person" and "audience" channels can join the ranks. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he believes that the "no darker" defective formula is a temptation to refuse to reject the "sailor" approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s okay to not get a value of 9,000 pounds at a time. You can pay in installments under the witness of Mr. Fool, and slowly repay it... Klein is silent in his heart. Make up one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is currently lacking the spinal fluid of the black-faced panther, so he doesn't mind the other party's credit, and he doesn't have to worry about running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount, there are also hidden dangers, if the "downside down" Mr. suddenly died, then I will lose money... Faced with such a heavy deal, Klein I can't help but still feel awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serial 4 potion defective formula? The incomplete recipe for the semi-god and half-human road? This can't be bought with money! "Justice" Audrey's eyes lit up, and before the "upside down", it was difficult to cover up curiously: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. World, I can Ask a question? Which route is the sequence 4 formula? If it is not convenient to answer, then I did not speak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"World" has a sequence The potion formula of 4, even if it is broken, is amazing... No wonder Mr. Fool will pull him into the Tarot Club! He is not a simple extraordinary person... The examination tasks of Fu, Hugh and Fols are over. Mr. "The Fool" does not mention the things that are not allowed to join. Um... He must have other considerations, perhaps I have to observe it for a while, I can't take the initiative to ask, this is not polite enough... For a time, Audrey thought a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of Miss "Justice" is in line with Klein’s needs, and he replied to the "world" with a hoarse voice:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was prepared to say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the sequence of the 'Sun' route 4 'no darkness' potion formula. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" route? Dairik Huo Di looked at the "world" who sat at the bottom of the bronze long table. The scorpion was an eager and eager moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he still kept silent because he knew that he was far from the door of the demigod, and the limited resources had to be powerful first. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just look at the style of the Silver City, because for their residents, there may be no future at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Darkness..." "Justice" Audrey elegantly daggers, delighted to say, "Thank you for your answer, 'Mr. World'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels she knows important information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Darkness..." "Inverted Man" Alger whispered slowly and responded calmly. "I am sorry, I don't need it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need? Klein grabbed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a reaction to his imagination, the default script is completely different! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His shackles indirectly made the "world" show an incredible sluggishness, after a few seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can owe a part, there is a 'fool' Mr. Witness, I believe that you will definitely make up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I really don't need it." "Upside down man" Alger shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need...I don’t really need it...He is confident that he will be able to get the favor and attention of the Storm Church in the future, and be directly given the corresponding potion? Or does he actually have a sequence of 4 potions recipes for the "Sailor" route? The name is "Disaster Master Festival"? Klein quickly thought of two possibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do? Is it possible to change the formula of "Witch" or "Happy Witch" with him? Klein silently ridiculed himself, deliberately let the "world" silence for a few seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Other potion recipes, or some secrets I know?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example... the secret of the top of the sequence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted man" Alger slightly changed I took my own sitting position and decided to answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know the secrets of some sequences at the top, how do you ensure that the two do not coincide, how to make sure you say Is the secret of the medullary crystal of the evil-skinned black leopard spinal fluid and the elf's spring?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We secretly know the top level of the sequence to the 'fool' Mr., compare or repeat by Him and confirm the value. 'Mr. Fool', can you?” Klein manipulated the “world” and asked himself a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he used a top-down gesture:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger slowly nodded: "I have no problem, let's get started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to know the top of the sequence The secret...but I haven’t had any extra money to buy it recently... “Justice” Audrey looks at the “world” and the “downside man” with a piece of parchment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From small to large, she did not make money for her, and finally realized the taste of "poverty." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Klein got the content written by two members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing he saw was the parchment that belonged to the "hanging man" and found the above content to be very simple, with only one sentence:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The top of the sequence hides the road to God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call...fortunately, or else For another piece of knowledge... Kline carefully examined the parchment of the "world" and smiled low: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does not repeat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For most extraordinary people, the secrets provided by Mr. 'World' are of little value, but in some people's eyes, it is vital, not money. It can be measured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this conclusion, "After Hanging Man" Alger was caught in a distressed mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For him, taking the two extraordinary materials at the same time is not a small burden, and you must sell a lot of valuable items in exchange for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At such a high price, just to listen to a secret that might not be useful to you? Alger thought about a dozen or twenty seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool's, can you give me more hints? I can't decide now."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to choose? Klein's mouth froze, knowing that the words he had just said to maintain the image had a counter-effect, played a bad role, and he thought about it a bit, and smiled slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The content he describes is an exhaustive addition to the secret you know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detailed addition? A detailed supplement to the road to God? “After hanging down” Alger no longer hesitated and turned to look at the “world”, short and powerfully said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
