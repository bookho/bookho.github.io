			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great probability... Klein manipulated the "world", gloomy and low-smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, I don't really have the potion formula of the 'Wind', and I can't find a way to get it in a short time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I There is a broken formula of the sequence 4 potion on hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it is broken, I think you should be very clear about its value, it can at least exchange 10,000 gold pounds, and most of the time, the double the price of the premium can not be bought, this is a key step in the qualitative change of human beings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, are you interested? The value of the spinal fluid of the evil-skinned panther is between 500 and 700 pounds. The medulla of the Elven Fountain crystallizes between 300 and 400 pounds. I think you need to prepare an extra 9000 pounds of cash or equivalent. Items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had long guessed that the "sun" route sequence 4 "no dark" can be compared with the "sailor" route, "readers The same way The sequence is interchanged, and this speculation has been confirmed side by side from Mr. A's request and Russell's diary, and even extends the suspicion that the "secret person" and "audience" channels can join the ranks. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he believes that the "no darker" defective formula is a temptation to refuse to reject the "sailor" approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s okay to not get a value of 9,000 pounds at a time. You can pay in installments under the witness of Mr. Fool, and slowly repay it... Klein is silent in his heart. Make up one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is currently lacking the spinal fluid of the black-faced panther, so he doesn't mind the other party's credit, and he doesn't have to worry about running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount, there are also hidden dangers, if the "downside down" Mr. suddenly died, then I will lose money... Faced with such a heavy deal, Klein I can't help but still feel awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serial 4 potion defective formula? The incomplete recipe for the semi-god and half-human road? This can't be bought with money! "Justice" Audrey's eyes lit up, and before the "upside down", it was difficult to cover up curiously: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. World, I can Ask a question? Which route is the sequence 4 formula? If it is not convenient to answer, then I did not speak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"World" has a sequence The potion formula of 4, even if it is broken, is amazing... No wonder Mr. Fool will pull him into the Tarot Club! He is not a simple extraordinary person... The examination tasks of Fu, Hugh and Fols are over. Mr. "The Fool" does not mention the things that are not allowed to join. Um... He must have other considerations, perhaps I have to observe it for a while, I can't take the initiative to ask, this is not polite enough... For a time, Audrey thought a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of Miss "Justice" is in line with Klein’s needs, and he replied to the "world" with a hoarse voice:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was prepared to say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the sequence of the 'Sun' route 4 'no darkness' potion formula. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" route? Dairik Huo Di looked at the "world" who sat at the bottom of the bronze long table. The scorpion was an eager and eager moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he still kept silent because he knew that he was far from the door of the demigod, and the limited resources had to be powerful first. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just look at the style of the Silver City, because for their residents, there may be no future at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Darkness..." "Justice" Audrey elegantly daggers, delighted to say, "Thank you for your answer, 'Mr. World'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels she knows important information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Darkness..." "Inverted Man" Alger whispered slowly and responded calmly. "I am sorry, I don't need it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reacts to his imagination, the default script is completely different! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His stunned indirectly made the "world" show an incredible sluggishness, after a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can owe a part first, and there is a 'fool' Mr. witness, I believe you will definitely make up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I Really don't need it." "The hanging man" Alger shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need...I don’t really need it...He is confident that he will be able to get the favor and attention of the Storm Church in the future, and be directly given the corresponding potion? Or does he actually have a sequence of 4 potions recipes for the "Sailor" route? The name is "Disaster Master Festival"? Klein quickly thought of two possibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do? Is it possible to change the formula of "Witch" or "Happy Witch" with him? Klein silently ridiculed himself, deliberately let the "world" silence for a few seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Other potion recipes, or some secrets I know?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example... the secret of the top of the sequence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted man" Alger slightly changed I took my own sitting position and decided to answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know the secrets of some sequences at the top, how do you ensure that the two do not coincide, how to make sure you say Is the secret of the medullary crystal of the evil-skinned black leopard spinal fluid and the elf's spring?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We secretly know the top level of the sequence to the 'fool' Mr., compare or repeat by Him and confirm the value. 'Mr. Fool', can you?” Klein manipulated the “world” and asked himself a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he used a top-down gesture:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger slowly nodded: "I have no problem, let's get started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to know the top of the sequence The secret...but I haven’t had any extra money to buy it recently... “Justice” Audrey looks at the “world” and the “downside man” with a piece of parchment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From small to large, she did not make money for her, and finally realized the taste of "poverty." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Klein got the content written by two members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing he saw was the parchment that belonged to the "hanging man" and found the above content to be very simple, with only one sentence:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The top of the sequence hides the road to God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call...fortunately, or else For another piece of knowledge... Kline carefully examined the parchment of the "world" and smiled low: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does not repeat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For most extraordinary people, the secrets provided by Mr. 'World' are of little value, but in some people's eyes, it is vital, not money. It can be measured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this conclusion, "After Hanging Man" Alger was caught in a distressed mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For him, taking the two extraordinary materials at the same time is not a small burden, and you must sell a lot of valuable items in exchange for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At such a high price, just to listen to a secret that might not be useful to you? Alger thought about a dozen or twenty seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool's, can you give me more hints? I can't decide now."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to choose? Klein's mouth froze, knowing that the words he had just said to maintain the image had a counter-effect, played a bad role, and he thought about it a bit, and smiled slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Detailed supplement? A detailed supplement to the road to God? “After hanging down” Alger no longer hesitated, turned his head to look at the “world”, and said briefly and briefly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Complete.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will exchange for the devilish black panther's spinal fluid for this week. And the medullary crystal of the Spring of the Elf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the premise is that they appear on the pirate event, although this probability is high, we still have to believe, Anything can happen, and as a result, it may be postponed until next week, next week, or even next month, please rest assured, I will definitely fulfill my promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "No problem, there is a 'fool' Mr. witness, I don't need to worry about anything." "World" hoarsely answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they confirmed the transaction, Klein put a piece of parchment in front of the "upside down man". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger can't wait to bow and read every word eagerly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 1 There is also a sequence of 0!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 0 is the sequence of the true god!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This can also be promoted through the corresponding potions and rituals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sequence 0? The sequence of the true God! "Inverted man" Alger was wrong, shocked, and immediately said with a silent voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out to be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, I understand what it means!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quietly took a breath and leaned back on the chair Back, like nothing has happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret must be amazing... "The man hanging up" is a bit stunned... "Justice" Audrey reluctantly removes his gaze and looks oblique Opposite the "Sun" Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Sun, I remember you said that Silver City has a sequence of Dragons, Sequence 8, Sequence 7 "Potion recipe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." "Sun" Dairik nodded honestly, "The name of the potion in Sequence 7 is 'spiritual analyst'." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do I have to pay if I want to get it?" Audrey asked awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sequence of the 'Sun' route 7 potion formula." Dairik answered without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey sighs lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I try to collect."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm... Hugh and Fols mention that in Mr. A’s party, there is an extraordinary person of the “Sun” route, at least in sequence 7, good at purifying and exorcising When the recent events have passed, you can try to start from here... In addition, take part in the gathering in the abandoned teaching building of the medical school, and find ways to contact the members of the psychological alchemy club... The two legs are sure to walk more than one leg... ...one thought flashed in Audrey's heart, but she suddenly found that even with the clues of the formula, she could not take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she was in a financial crisis for the past few months, she could barely support it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formula of the sequence 7 is worth about 800 pounds, and it can still be put together. Um... It’s already in October, it’s coming to the New Year, when I am a mature adult, and there will be more wealth that I can control freely... Or, exchange the knowledge taught by Mr. Fool? I don't know what attitude He has towards this behavior... Audrey's thoughts gradually spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She decided to wait for the recipe to have something to hope for, then ask Mr. "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the transaction, Klein wanted to use the knowledge he had learned to replace a magical item with little hidden danger, but after discovering the pain of "downside down" I know that the other party will pay a small price for the two extraordinary materials. It is estimated that there will be no extra things left, and I can only give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
