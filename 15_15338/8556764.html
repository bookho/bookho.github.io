			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Arrods, my second question is, how did Sherlock Moriarty escape the ruins?" The mood is a lot easier than just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of the silver mirror shimmers, quickly sketching out Sherlock. Moriarty back against the wall, the fists are sometimes loosened, and sometimes the picture is tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Icons Bernard and the nearby "Mechanical Heart" deacon, the captains saw the private detective revealing a pompous smile, a turn, pull The gun rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, influenced by composition, they all have a tragic and passionate feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture inside the mirror jumps, showing Sherlock. Moriarty holds the revolver, shoots the altar, but has no effect, the piece is The extraordinary bullets that were separated seemed to be a bit worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sherlock Moriarty threw out a key made of brass, and the altar showed signs of pollution instability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blast broke out, Mr. A fell to the ground, Sherlock. Moriarty ran out of the temple-style building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, the picture turned, the slightly turbid Tassok River became the main background, Sherlock Moriatti and Mr. A floating in the water, At the same time, I looked at the air, where there was a gap with no clouds or fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost instantaneously, Mr. A became transparent and disappeared, leaving only Sherlock. Moriarty was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Rescue of the Church of the Night?" Ikons frowned. "Unfortunately, he did not mention in the letter what happened at the time, we are completely There is no guess. He wants to sell this secret for a good price, or is it simply affected and loses the relevant memory? Also, his escape experience in the underground ruins has nothing to show, and it seems that the hidden clues are also hidden. Hidden..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly analyzed it with a streamlined statement, and then the psychological burden was not too much to position the reciprocal treatment as an answer, not an adventure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrods seems to have no prank spirit today, can make full use of this point... Icons himself is relieved and sees a bloody word on the mirror . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, he had a bad hunch and suspected that Arrods had adjusted and restored the "state." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood-like words creep, quickly forming a question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You give everything Who is going to please, but only who is the object of discarding the ending?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, Icons’s face was first lost, then it became red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem pierced the hidden wounds in his heart and made him feel overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say who he is, his reputation will be finished before tonight... I have become a "legend" in some sense...Ikon It was hard to swallow and spit, and said in a tragic tone: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I chose to punish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A flash of lightning immediately fell, but unlike before, it was no longer silver and was contaminated with a little green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the top of ICONSER’s head, stimulating his hair roots to erect and reflect the color of lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook like a swaying stun, as if he had been immersed in a hallucinogenic drug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop Horamick sighed and closed his eyes, whispering himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "'0' seals?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Icons slowed down, he looked around:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is another question, where is the key to the destruction of the coming ceremony by Sherlock Moriatti.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you using? '2-111'? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Mechanical Heart" deacon and the captains here are watching me, I see you, and no one responds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the water is slamming, slamming the cabin, there seems to be only between the heavens and the earth. Under this kind of voice, the sea at night is silent and silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein suddenly woke up, opened his eyes and saw the wooden ceiling covered with blushing moon yarn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spiritual instinct tells him that there are things outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is in the rendezvous? He listened to his ears and vaguely grasped some unnatural sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was slightly indulged, rolled over and sat up, put on gloves, and put on a coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his eyes deep and pulled out the gold coins, bounced up and quickly made a divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting no dangerous revelation, he took out the left wheel pressed under the pillow and broke into his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing the preparations, Klein opened the door and walked out of the room and followed the sound to the upper deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, from the sea of ​​industrial pollution, the blushing moon hangs quietly, and is mysterious and dreamy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful to bypass a few patrolling crew members, Klein arrived in the moving area and smelled a less obvious bloody smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used the moonlight to look at the past and discover what the former adventurer Krivis is setting on the side of the ship,<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow of the cabin, which is a dozen meters away from the gentleman, there are three people hiding, one is the partner of Krivis, the female bodyguard wearing a black coat, and the rest is them. Employer's children, 14-year-old girls and young gentlemen under 10 years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two underage guys wore thick cotton gowns and draped coats that came out in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cold wind of the night, they were a little trembling, but they still squatted in spirit and looked at Crevis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hide and Seek? Klein teased in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately increased the footsteps and let the eyes of Krivis and others vote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friends, what happened?" Klein recalled the demeanor of some of the bounty hunters who met in the Eastern District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he still maintains the unique sense of coldness and sharpness of the identity of German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no change in the expression of Krivis.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A private life, an accident Also worth looking forward to hunting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunting? Klein suddenly had some interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used German as his own name because it represents the first hunter in a game he played in his life, with him. The idea of ​​hunting evil on the sea is more appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not in a hurry to ask why, funnyly wearing the shadow of the left side of the "sweet hungry" finger:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Private? Do private work in front of the employer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a look at the girl and the boy, The tone is unchanged: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Cecil is not careful enough to wake up Donna and Denton, only to let them follow."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl named Donna heard that she was mentioned, wrinkled her nose, and curiously asked Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Uncle, are you also an adventurer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle? Even if I am on earth, I am at most 10 years older than you! Klein laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you can't use the word 'also'. Strictly speaking, there is only one adventurer here. They are just bodyguards now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to Kerry Weiss Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, man, what prey was found?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crivi Siwang hopes to dye the faint blush of the sea channel:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A fish man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Fish man? This is an extraordinary creature! Although it is the lowest level, but the average person wants to deal with it is quite troublesome, how can there be five or six people, four or five guns, only to be sure... Yes, the scales of the fisherman are very strong, the pistol can only be half Breaking the defense, you have to have a burst of rifles... Klein raised his eyebrows and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do? And how do you know that it is a fisherman?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crevis pointed at the edge of the ship's side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a surface of it that is corrosive A little trace of it, it was tried to climb the ship one or two hours ago, attacking the passengers, but at that time the deck was still very lively, with many sailors and crew."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a few steps forward and saw that the edge of the ship's side was really a bit greenish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recalled the information he had contacted in Tingen City, confirmed the written content, and asked with interest:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is it definitely a one, not a group?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers the tendency of fish people to live in a living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is a group, they will directly destroy the bottom of the ship, let everyone sink, and, in this channel and the surrounding waters, groups of fish people It has long been cleaned up, and people in the storm church like to hunt them," Krivis explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s because the fisherman’s probability corresponds to one of the main materials of the sequence 9 “Sailor” potion... Kleinmo’s revolver in the pocket, with a smile道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crivis did not answer directly, open Next to the paper bag, there are pigs and viscera with blood, which is the source of bloody smell that Klein smells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All fish people like this kind of food, can't resist the temptation of them, of course, these monsters love the human internal organs, so, at many seas In the legend, it is emphasized that some pigs' internal organs or canned viscera should be prepared in the vessel's kitchen." Krivis said that he sprinkled some particles on it. "The pepper particles can make the fishermen feel marijuana-like excitement and lose. A certain balance ability, this will last for about a minute. After that, the fisherman who is highly excited will be very tired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately took it from the clothes Put out a wooden box and apply a greenish cream to the tip of the triangular thorn, the dagger and the short knife:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Plyz Port's popular mint cream pair For humans, it is a unique sweet food that can be fatal toxins in the eyes of fish people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, I also borrowed from sailors Two rifles, made a promise of not disturbing here for twenty minutes, and spent a lot of money, but as long as they can successfully hunt A fish person, there will be ten times, twenty times, even three times the harvest. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a veteran adventurer who knows the weaknesses and problems of prey very clearly... Listen to him saying that I feel that they are really successful in hunting fish people." The possibility, even if they are not extraordinary... The low-sequence extraordinary is really not much stronger than the average person in the face of traps and hot weapons... The low-sequence extraordinary who died in the gang fight is not without... However, the fisherman is like wearing a full armor, not so good to kill, it will hurt, but may not escape... Klein curiously asks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You seem to have killed a lot of fish people? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understanding the characteristics of a common sea monster is a prerequisite for an adventurer to live. "Crevis has not been praised for the joy, still quiet.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two talk, the girl Donna and the boy Danden are in the shadows, hear Relish, I only know that it is the most interesting thing in the world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
