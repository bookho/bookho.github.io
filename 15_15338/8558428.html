			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long Wei" surged, "Gi Lishi" Ozil and his subordinates at the same time, as if being smashed with a giant hammer a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, some of them rushed around, some fled without purpose, some kept spinning in the same place, some stood still and shivered, The responses are classified into categories, each with a difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With just being afraid of the "smart speaker" Misor recovered, it must be different from time to time, at this time Klein has spared attention to the audience, grasping in an instant The situation: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Different reactions are based on the difference between the spirit and the toughness. The most vulnerable and most common ones are rushing. The normal human beings are more determined. The extraordinary person who has no purpose to escape, the extraordinary person whose spirit has improved, and the ordinary person who is quite determined will be mainly in situ. If you want to escape and you can initially restrain yourself, the extraordinary person with strong strength or tenacity is a trembling and in situ. Turn the combination.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The type of escape and evasion that scares incontinence..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Ryan’s eyes were swept away, he was going to shoot with a gun, so that he could threaten his enemy’s ability to fight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he found a man with a trembling The eyes have recovered from the Qingming, and it seems that they are about to get rid of the impact of the shock, while other people have also appeared to a certain extent. Signs of recovery.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that it is impossible to solve them together in a short period of time, the gunshots are also easy to awaken some people, and the different abilities of different extraordinary people It is likely to cause harm to himself, and Klein thought about a turn, and the glove of the left palm was stained with sinister black.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He became a deeper eye Dark, forcibly "distorted" the intention of the awakened.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trembling man slammed and fled, and the idea of ​​running away was hard to contain, going straight to the secret exit. Going, leaving the employer "Gi Lishi" Ozl with a smaller and smaller back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quickly in the "psychologist" and "the corrupt baron" "Starting to switch between, "Long Wei" followed by "distorted", then "Long Wei", then "distorted", and soon expelled several powerful or tough Ozil guards out of the underground area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although "squirming hunger" can't be compared with the real "shepherd", between different souls There is a certain buffer, but Klein's rhythm is very well grasped, and there is a "Long Wei" influence remaining, and it is easy to achieve the goal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he also I found a problem. For some targets, if it is repeatedly affected by Longwei in a short period of time, the effect of “shocking” will become worse and worse. Of course, most of the “Gi Lishi” Ozil’s subordinates are After being repeatedly superimposed on "Long Wei", now all of them have collapsed to the ground, urinating and sloping, and stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The combination of 'Long Wei' and 'Twisted' is really good... Before Misor did not want to counterattack, with 'bribe-weakened' and 'twisted 'Forcibly escaping, I really can't catch up, kill it, um, his counterattack is also very powerful. There are almost no signs in the early stage. If it is not 'divination' and 'clown', it depends on spirituality and hunch, I might even It’s too late to use paper people as a substitute, let alone avoid it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This reminds me that even if the 'squirming hunger' has the sequence 5 combat power, it can't I looked at the other sequence 6. I might have been killed when I was careless..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thoughts, Klein made the gloves look like gold There were two lightning bolts in the eyelids.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glory" Ozlton screamed, it was hard to support, and the mountain collapsed like a fall. Ground, struggling with his head, like a squid just caught.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, no The extraordinary ability of range attack type, otherwise those extraordinary people can stay... I remember the "Lightning Storm" in the "Sea King" field... But this spell is too advanced, beyond my current knowledge... Klein I glanced at the floor with a thug, and entered the underground area unhurriedly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was originally a trading market, but now the escape has escaped and is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ozl rolled over for a while and finally slowed down from the pain of getting out of control, but still felt his head seem to be split. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was about to stand up, suddenly saw a pair of very light and reflective gold eyes, saw a glove covered with dark gold scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, he still has cold sweat on his forehead. He only feels that there are vortexes in one eye after another, and all his mind is sucked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein said quietly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You used to be a pirate?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Ozl found himself very eager to answer each other's questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a "psychological suggestion"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein asked again invariably:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What have you done against the kingdom? What about the law?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ozl did not conceal, and briefly talked about some of the things he did when he was a pirate and fragrant leaf bar owner, including looting passenger ships. In the process, insulting female passengers, killing innocent people, including in order to crack down on competitors, kidnapping each other's family, and setting up an ambush, let their whole family sink into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened quietly, his mouth slowly slammed, his right hand patted the left hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It's a competent pirate, a qualified gangster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the praise, he extended his left palm, and the thin man took a look Cracked open mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a scream of screaming in the underground area, but it only lasted for a few seconds and stopped, only the remaining music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat in his chair and quietly watched the bright light spots in front of him slowly gather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around him, the gangsters who were scared of incontinence and knew that they were huddled instinctively stayed away from him and climbed a trace of filth on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Klein slowly stood up, bent over and picked up the pure light ball like a baby fist, and the wallet in Ozil clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the thickness of the banknote, he put away the two items, put the revolver, took off the half-high silk hat, and shivered to the corner. The gangsters took a ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When done all this, Klein checked the underground area, but regretted that he did not find the safe and other items, he had to return to the passage, mentioning the "smart speaker" Misor The body of Kim went to the entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stayed for two seconds, and his mind naturally outlined the outside scene, and found that the guards who thought they would try to open the door, the rescuers who came in the rescue did not know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Long Wei" just let them understand that this is a battle between extraordinary people, so retreat? It is worthy of being a pirate-stricken area. Some ordinary people also have the opportunity to understand the extraordinary people... It seems that similar things happen frequently here? An wanted criminal was raided by the "offenders"? Klein untied the chain and touched Misor's pocket to transfer the other's cash to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resist the urge to harvest, he lit the paper man, shivered out, then opened the entrance gate and walked out with the body of Misor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, most of the alcoholic people have dispersed, leaving only seven or eight people hiding in different places waiting for results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked around without a look, letting the gaze rushed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only one who dared to look at him was Ust Kent, the military liaison officer frowned, watching Galman Sparo A corpse slowly came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
