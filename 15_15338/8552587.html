			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. "Men"... This style is very similar to me... I don’t know that this is trapped in the depths of the storm, lost in the darkness. What is the real name of the guy, the equivalent of a sequence, or, indeed, as expected by Russell the Great, is one of the devils of the evil spirits... Klein is half-baked and laughs at himself, and has some history of the Quaternary. Very interested:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know the most famous Quaternary War of the Quaternary, but the specific details and main characters are limited to understanding Those that have been circulated by the great churches, such as the 'black emperor' of the Solomon Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Until today, the so-called 'door' was untied My doubts, let me know who the three remaining in the Four Emperors, the Tubo dynasty 'blood emperor', the 'night emperor' of the Trumpost Empire, and the 'Ming Emperor' of the South Continent , also known as the god of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the description of Mr. Gate, this change In the war of the whole world situation, the Black Emperor, the Blood Emperor and the Night Emperor have fallen, and the Emperor has taken the greatest benefit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking of it,' Mr. Men’s meaningfully made up a sentence. After more than one hundred years of digestion, the god of death was crazy, but it was stronger. So he joined forces with the original witch to bring a 'palm disaster' to the northern continent. Of course, this It’s not what he’s seen with his own eyes, but what he hears when he’s near the real world every month.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Death is crazy, but It is even stronger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods will also go crazy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really let Amazing words!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, this confirms one of my guesses, that is, before the Fifth Age, those gods will often come to reality. The world, directly interfering with the situation on the North and South continents, may even end in person as a god of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked Gate 'Mr., is he involved in the 'four kings battle'? If so, what role does it play? And what role did the Seven Gods play in this war and what role did they play?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. 'Men' did not answer my question, just said something interesting, the Quaternary top strongman is much more than I expected. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, he also mentioned two laws, one is the law of extraordinary characteristics, and the other is the law of conservation of extraordinary characteristics in similar sequences. Some of the things that are known in the most secret and oldest organization are consistent with some of the phenomena I have observed. Oh, this can lead to many interesting conclusions, and the interpretation of many things presents another look, making people fear The appearance of a person trembles, for example, in the same way, the high sequence is more, the low sequence will be less, and vice versa. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the extraordinary feature has fixed the total from the source, will not increase, will not decrease, does this mean that there is really a master who creates all, The omnipotent God, everything comes from Him? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the longest Russell diary that Klein has ever seen. It occupies a full two pages of paper, imaginable, it was originally positive. The negative form exists, but after repeated transcriptions, it becomes a separate two pages.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The amount of information is really big..." Klein silently said <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a graduate of the history department of normal graduating, he always thought that the Solomon Empire, the Tudor dynasty, and the Terencer Empire were alternative inheritance relations. There is a certain restoration. Who knows, the "War of the Four Emperors" described by Mr. "Men" clearly reveals that the three dynasties existed at the same time!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "If this matter is true, it will really subvert most of the current research in the Quaternary. Klein suddenly remembered the original Lord. He was interested in archaeology for exploring the history of the Quaternary.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I have helped him reach a wish...No Knowing whether the death god in the "Four Emperors' War" has become a true god, it is difficult to judge this according to the expression of Mr. "Men". It can only be assumed that the 'Menghuang' at this time is captured through the Battle of the Four Emperors. The benefits, breaking through the limits, became a god, but he is also mad because of it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the so-called evil spirit a mad orthodox god? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will there be one day, the whole world will only have evil spirits...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶, this Does it mean that the end of the day cannot be reversed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein used a smile to conceal the gradual dignity and felt that the future he imagined was full of dark tones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he raised the evaluation of "Black Emperor", "Blood Emperor" and "Night Emperor", thinking that they are close to the top of the gods Strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe sequence 1 is the existence of the peak of a single route. According to this logic, the 'black emperor' has lived for hundreds of years and is not too impossible. The accepted things, the doubts before the original Lord are also explained. He deduced from the contents of the Antignus family that he contradicted his own tutor's view, saying that the 'black emperor' is actually the common of every emperor of the Solomon Empire. Title... Perhaps, the Black Emperor has always been the black emperor... Of course, it does not rule out another possibility, such as two or three times, but the sequence 1 of this route is called 'Black Emperor'?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know which one of the Quaternary history Mr. Gate will be... Russell the Great did not describe his wrong experiment and accidental coincidence, let me think It is impossible to talk to the Mr. 'Men'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The law of indestructibility, the law of conservation of properties in similar sequences, and the feeling of the captain Similarly, perhaps the vocabulary he uses is from Rose. The Great has been handed down there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the two laws described by Mr. Gate, it is indeed possible to deduce many interesting guesses, for example, there are so many The sacred objects, the seven churches with so many high-sequence strongmen should not have many low-sequence extraordinarys, but this contradicts reality. The only reasonable explanation is the extra gift of the gods?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, is the demise of the night country just because of the conservation of identity and sin? Or their existence seriously weakens the power of the 'night' approach, threatening the position of the goddess ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, in theory, some seals can also be used as the main material of the potion, even equal to the potion, of course, the premise is Remove hidden hidden dangers and madness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No wonder some of the excavations The literature refers to the Quaternary as the 'God of the Gods'. In the past, the gods still have many descending records." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is because what causes them to stop coming, even the gods are almost cut off?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is not the ritual magic that can get a response, I am afraid that many extraordinary people will doubt whether the god exists..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought a lot, I think In the mysterious field, I went deeper in the extraordinary world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly flipped through the next four pages of diaries and found that he was no longer related to Mr. "Men" and was suddenly disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability of the "Clown" allowed him to conceal his emotions well, plus the fog, and even sneaked his "Justice" Miss Julie did not find anything wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Converging the messy thoughts, Klein reads the diary on the third page:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"September On the 10th, I had to endure for a long time, but I couldn’t help but complain a few words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"MyTM was the generalist who chose the brain when it entered the water." "Where is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, this really gives me the best advantage, so I am valued by the church, but the problem is that it has several sequences in front of it. Lack of practical and extraordinary ability, can only rely on magical items to make do, and rely too much on external things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, sequence 9 'Generals', Only the extraordinaryness of memory, learning, and practical ability, for example, the sequence of 8 'archaeologists', is a strong body and corresponding ancient knowledge, only barely able to apply some ritual magic, for example, the sequence 7 'identifier', The ability is to quickly identify magical items, which can be used to avoid hidden dangers when used. For example, the sequence 6 'artisan' can make mechanical odds. And not a strong extraordinary item, but in addition, the level of ritual magic will be improved, no wonder its modern name is 'mechanical expert'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
