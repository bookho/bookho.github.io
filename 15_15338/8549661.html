			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon of the raging sun, Klein stepped out of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he had to walk from Iron Cross Street to Welch’s residence, he changed his dress, hat and boots, and changed to a linen shirt, old brown Jackets, the same color round felt hats and old leather shoes, so you don't have to worry about the smell of sweat pollution that is a valuable set. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the Narcissus Street, he walked slowly toward Iron Cross Street, passing through the corner square, looking down at the subconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top tent was gone, and the former circus had finished the show early and left the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had originally imagined that the animal trainer who was divining himself was actually a hidden power, because he discovered his own special, dedicated to guiding, There will be some encounters and hints in the follow-up. However, nothing happened. She followed the circus and started the next journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which there are so many routines... Klein smiled and shook his head and turned to Iron Cross Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Cross Street is not just one, but like its name, it is formed by two roads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a crossroads as the core, it is divided into left street, right street, upper street and lower street, where Klein, Benson and Melissa lived before. The apartment is located just down the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the people living in the apartment and around do not think that the neighborhood is down the street, but instead created the term "zhongjie", with two hundred meters The difference between the poor gathering places outside the road extension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There, a bedroom may squeeze five, six, or even ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walked on the edge of the left street, his thoughts spread out, remembered the notes of the Antignus family, and remembered its incomprehension. Traced, remembered the attention of the value of the night, remembered the bloody case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mood slowly became heavy and his face was gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a familiar voice was introduced into his ear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small Klein."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well... Klein turned his head and found himself walking to the door of the "Sling Bakery", the gray-haired Mrs. Wendy was carrying A soft smile raised his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't look too much, not too happy?" Wendy and her mouth open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stunned his face:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A little bit."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter how many troubles, tomorrow will come." Mrs. Wendy said with a smile. "Come, help me try my new sweet iced tea, I don't know." Whether it is suitable for the taste of the locals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Local, isn't Mrs. Sling yourself?" Klein shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try it should be free? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty.Slingen has a lower mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You guessed it, I actually It was a southerner who followed my husband to Tingen. This was something more than 40 years ago. Oh, then Benson was not born yet, and your father and mother didn’t even know each other.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have always been unaccustomed to the food style of the North. I always miss the food in my hometown, I miss the pork sausage, I miss the potato bread, I miss the pancakes, I miss the fried vegetables, I miss the features. The barbecue of the sauce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I also miss sweet iced tea..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Ryan heard a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Sling, this is really a hungry topic...but I feel a lot better, thank you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Klein thanked him, he took a sip and felt that the drink had some taste of iced black tea on the earth, but it was not so irritating. The tea taste was stronger and the refreshing feeling was even worse. It dispelled the burning heat caused by the raging sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great!" he exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I am relieved." Wendy smiled and narrowed her eyes, and looked at Klein to finish the cup of sweet iced tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After chatting with Mrs. Sling for a new home, Klein returned to the most familiar street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, there are a lot of street vendors here. They will not regroup after 5:30, and the rest are not spirited. Look like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just getting here, Klein’s mood suddenly became inexplicably gloomy, with a sense of oppression, depression and darkness that could not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? He was keenly aware of his own fault, and immediately paused and looked around, but he did not see anything strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Klein raised his hand and tapped his eyes like a thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in sight and changed immediately. The gas field of a street vendor and several pedestrians was presented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has not had time to examine their healthy colors, and is attracted by the rich and bleakness that symbolizes emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific thoughts of the observer, he could not judge, but the impression of pessimism, numbness and depression was deeply rooted in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a circle, he found that the darkness was nearby, even if the sun could not be dispelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a repression of how many days and months have been dyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Klein understands why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Old Neal said, it’s easy to start a self-consciousness because it’s uncomfortable to enter an unfamiliar environment, and it’s easy to be infected by other people’s emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar principle can also be used on the ability of “inspiration” – this is the ability to become a “diviner” without the need for additional learning. It is a passive and unrejectable sensor that allows people to directly detect the existence of some abnormal conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is definitely a certain degree of interaction, so in the extraordinary eyes of "Psychic", everyone's inspiration is so obvious, Just like the torch in the night, people with high inspiration will naturally be easily and easily affected by an unusual and strong atmosphere. They can only be controlled through repeated exercises to control and adapt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it so long that the depressed 'hue' will take shape?" Klein shook his head and touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tapped his eyebrows again and tried to consolidate spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒,哒,哒, Klein step by step toward the apartment, sensing other possible anomalies and subtleties to find hidden by the “self” Antignus family notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street is as clean as usual, with dirty water and rubbish, all the way to the door of the apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pushed the half-covered door and turned around on the first floor in the darkness that the sun could not reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went up the first step, letting the wooden stairs continue to make a squeaky voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor continues to lack light, and Klein indulges inspiration and looks straight into the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he not only failed to find clues to notes, but even the invisible spirit did not see one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is so easy to meet, most ordinary people will not be aware of the existence of extraordinary things..." Klein himself sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
