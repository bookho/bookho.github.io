			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 10 o'clock in the evening, Becklander started a patter of light rain, and the thin mist of water gave the light of the gas street lamp a sly beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger Stanton’s assistant Bowen patrolled the bottom lap and walked to the bulging window, ready to close the last window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a black shadow came in and steadily landed on the protruding wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually a blue short-haired stray cat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bowen sees each other's big, round yellow eyes looking at himself, can't help but laugh low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no food here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because detective work is easy to attract revenge, and there are many secrets that need to be hidden, so Essinger. The Stanton family's chefs and servants are hourly workers, who only have a fixed number of hours a day, and don't prepare too much food at a time, which makes them difficult to keep after dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue short-haired cat opened his mouth, but did not make a squeaking voice, but spoke like a human:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Sherlock. Moriarty, I want to see Mr. Essinger Stanton.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ......"Baowen is an extraordinary person cultivated by the Church of Knowledge and Wisdom, but the sequence itself is not too high, and the knowledge is not too much. This is the first time that I have met a talking cat. It is inevitable to be shocked and lost for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few seconds, he recovered his waking, reminiscent of the words of the blue shorthair:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;It says...it says it is Sherlock. Moriarty?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big detective is really not easy!<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can turn into a cat, no, control a cat!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability is really another Weird and shocked!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bao Wen calmed down quickly Did not directly answer the blue shorthair cat, reached out and closed the glass window.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he pressed down the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue short-haired cat immediately jumped down the platform behind the belly window, and the tail tilted up and walked agilely behind the Bowen side, followed him all the way. On the second floor, watch him ring the door of Essinger Stanton's bedroom.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter? Asking Essinger in a light striped pajamas opens the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is enjoying tobacco before bedtime.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The blog post cautiously pointed to the blue short-haired cat pointing to the side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock. Mr. Moriarty is looking for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two white spots and thin face Essinger's eyebrows slightly lifted, looked down and looked back, letting the blue shorthairs sway Walked into his bedroom.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You go back to the room to sleep, get up on time tomorrow, we still have cases waiting to be traced. "Essinger told the blog post as if nothing had happened.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the assistant left, he closed the door and turned to look at the easy chair. The blue shorthair next to me, chuckled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to have this extraordinary ability, I am worried that you will come directly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I noticed the exclamation mark. "The blue shorthair cat smiles.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that this expression on the face of a cat is quite illegal and will give the witnesses a kind of spine. The feeling of chilling hair.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe in your wisdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your compliment." The blue short-haired cat politely extended his claws and performed a gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger stared at it, rubbing his pipe and smiling: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should I already understand what happened.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the group did not dare to monitor it very strictly, fearing to be discovered by me, telling the Church of the Night and the Steam Church, huh, they Once exposed, there will be no small trouble, but I believe that there must be half gods among them. This is both reasoning and some conclusions that feedback tells me. After all, I have lived in this street for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, humans and animals entering my house will not be blocked, and you have already thought of it. When you leave, you will be followed by follow-up, you Is there any way to get rid of them? Um...the amount of money is quite large, and it will be very conspicuous to take them out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me think about it, You are planning to communicate with me, let me deposit the money into the designated bank account, and then you will find a lot of people, in different places outside Beckland, in batches and simultaneously extract? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Essinger laughed and laughed at himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what I can think of The best way, but the operation will be very troublesome. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue Shorthair did not make a positive answer, low smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only I need you to borrow an unmanned room and three candles for me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem. "Essinger Stanton did not ask, and instead said, "The price of this share transfer is 12,000 pounds. The buyer is the daughter of Hall Count, Audrey, um, hired lawyers and accounting team, published The advertisement cost a total of 600 pounds. In addition, a 0.5% stamp duty and a 20% Class D income tax were paid, leaving 8940 pounds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class D tax refers to income tax on income from business, finance and special industries.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah... there are no more than two thousand pounds... The expression of the blue shorthair is a bit sluggish.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein used to be a night lover, no salary to pay Personal income tax, and later private detectives, income is difficult to be supervised, so he never volunteered to file tax returns. Later, he became an adventurer, because there are concessions for pirates, there is no tax, and there is no awareness in this regard. Even if Essinger Stanton had a question about taxation last time, he did not care about it. He didn't think there would be much. As a result, the reality gave him a great deal.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why the last equity transaction was not taxed, it was because the Lun government encouraged initial investment in inventions and there was a corresponding reduction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After a short silence, the blue short-haired cat's beard moved two times:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, you Give me the cash, the amount moved to the deserted room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no problem with cash?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have checked it, they won't Doing small things in this regard, this is an insult to my IQ.” Essinger got up with a pipe, “I will remember to give me a signed confirmation transaction and mail it over.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's already on the road." The blue shorthair cat responded early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger then went to the safe in the master bedroom, opened it with a password and key, then pulled out a stack of cash and stuffed them into a different Inside the briefcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he took these briefcases, left the master bedroom, and entered the diagonally opposite guest bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You count." Essinger put down the briefcase filled with cash and said to the blue shorthair that followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe in you." The blue shorthair looked a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a candle inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he retreated to the door and pulled the handle, saying with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It's really curious how you will leave... I think this will be a wonderful 'magic'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knock, Essinger Stanton Closed the door to make the guest bedroom quiet and deserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blue short-haired cat quickly emerged with a dark red coat wearing an old triangular hat. It is Klein’s secret mate, “Resentment” Senol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned out the candle and quickly arranged a simple altar, omitting all the front links, and whispering directly with the Elvish:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The leader of the sea and the spiritual world, the protector of the Rothde Islands, the dominator of the sea creatures, the master of the tsunami and storm, the great Cavitowa.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your faithful servant prays for your gaze;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for your acceptance;<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for you to open the door to the kingdom. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind in the wall of spirituality has become fierce, and Senigal quickly scratched the skin of his hands with his nails and pulled out a drop of blood.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the "hate" of Sequence 5, everything in his body is equal to the material that is rich in spirituality!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The wind blew away the blood and poured the candle that symbolizes "Poseidon" Cavitewa, letting it expand and turn into an illusory door full of magic signs and symbols.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After ten or so seconds, the door made a heavy screaming sound, slowly opening a little.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Seneol spins the briefcases that are about to be loaded with cash one by one and throws them into the illusory door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until there is no more, he is inside A gold coin was taken out and landed on the altar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of this "resent" disappeared and projected onto the smooth part of the gold coin. Br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold coin staggered and flew, followed the front of the briefcase and entered the door of the illusory sacrifice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing, that The mysterious door was closed, and the three candlelights returned to normal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the blue shorthair seemed to have recovered itself, suddenly Looking left and right, I made a squeaking voice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Essinger opened the door and found that the briefcases with the banknotes were all gone, only three were left. The candle burned quietly, leaving only the blue short-haired cat bowing his back with vigilance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was watching this scene deeply, the street was another At the end of the mouth, a van rental carriage drove slowly and unhurriedly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The same night, in a building in the Jowood area.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sparse drizzle, I went back home and wiped my hair with a towel. On the side of Fols: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your letter has been sent. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folse "Hmm", secretly guessed when the teacher could reply.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At this time, rest the towel, casually said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. X's party has a message passed, or the place before, Friday night. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good, you can tell Mr. "World"! I don't know how much I need to pay... Firth hears my eyes bright.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
