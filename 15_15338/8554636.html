This is a dinner invitation from Mrs. Starling Summer to the maid for a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Almost forgot this thing... disguised blind date party..." Klein put down the invitation, went to the first floor bathroom, cleaned the lower face with cold water Let yourself look a lot more spiritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a thicker black whisker around his lips and on his lower jaw than when he first arrived at Bakerland, although he did not completely eliminate himself. The book is temperament, but it makes him look mature and rough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a real acquaintance, can't recognize me in person... Klein breathed a sigh of relief, wiped his face, and put the gold-rimmed glasses on the bridge of the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a break, put on a tight-fitting shirt with a neckline, a black tuxedo, and then officially wore a half-height silk hat, holding a cane and The invitation, went out and turned to the next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ringing bell of the Dangdang, he saw the opening door of the maid Julian, and saw the blonde with a high plate and a silver earring with a silver earring . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took off his hat and gave a tribute, politely praised:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Summer Madam, you are very beautiful today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although his sentence has a strong perfunctory nature, today’s Stalin is indeed much more beautiful than usual. Carefully dressed up in this field, her ability seems to have achieved a breakthrough growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be the case of rape, so that she and Mrs. Mary truly become "friends", and the other is a millionaire who is worth tens of thousands of pounds, and now they have entered The Kingdom's Air Pollution Investigation Committee has met a lot of dignitaries, and must have enough knowledge in makeup, clothing, jewelry, etc... Klein has nostalgic in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starlin’s mouth is hard to contain: #br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is my new purchase. Earrings, you need a full 8 sul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms., your style hasn’t changed... Klein smiled and handed the hat, cane and coat Maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireplace and pipes in the house bring warmth to the feeling of early summer. Many ladies and ladies’ dresses are relatively less rigid, and some show a half-white. Arms, some of them are slippery on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luke is having a business with a few friends, let me say sorry to you on his behalf." Starling did the job of the hostess. You should eat first, I will wait to introduce you to several well-behaved young ladies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is not necessary, let me eat quietly... Ryan smiled and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already smelled the smell of food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the guests More than 20, the dinner was held in the form of self-help. Klein took the plate and took a turn and found that the food was a lot more than before:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cold squid, chicken pie, pea stewed lamb, salted breast, curry food, roast beef, cooked turkey, beef tongue pie, ham, salad and cream cake...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine is still champagne plus red wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in line with the appetite of carnivores. Kline smashed a large plate, didn't go looking for someone to chat, shrunk into the corner, and slowly tasted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was ready to take the second round, he was finally discovered by Starling Summer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he was next to the wife and saw an acquaintance, serious lawyer Yurgen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, Jürgen is also a bachelor... Klein smiled and scraped together, greeted him with a conviction:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"How is Mrs. Doris recovering?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgen uncomfortably pulled the collar:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She will be discharged next week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is great." Klein sincerely said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Starling has brought a few ladies to come over and introduce them to them:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is Mr. Jürgen Cooper, a senior attorney who pays at least £3 a week. He often has a case, his annual income must exceed 200 pounds, and he is young and promising. It is very likely to become a barrister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Mr. Sherlock Moridie, a well-known detective, his income is not stable, but each pen Very rich, such as 10 pounds, 50 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. This introduction is too straightforward... Klein couldn’t help but swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And next to him, Jurgen clearly frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starlin did not feel any problem to continue to introduce:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sala. Miss Taylor, her parents are faculty members of the grammar school..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Angina Watson, her father is a civilian in the Beckland Police Department ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled numbly, to the lady say hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Stellan finished, Jurgen said with a deep voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Summer Mrs. It’s not a polite thing to mention other people’s income in person.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stalene is not angry, responds very seriously:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, this is very important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can like each other and build a family, income is essential The basis of this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think that there are always meat, vegetables, fruits, milk, white bread, butter, butter and other foods every week? At least I have to spend 1 pound and 5 sul on this. This is not a wine. In addition, I have to rent a good house. I have to pay nearly 1 pound per week. Well, I have to buy water, gas, charcoal, soap, etc. Things, you have to consider the cost of travel, which adds up to almost 10 Sule."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the most basic overhead, don't you bring your lady Go to the concert, go to the theatre ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you add some new clothes every year? Miss, I think that a family must spend at least 30 pounds a year on it. Decent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to this, there are salaries of the maid, the cost of education for the children, the medical expenses required, and the expenditure of some necessary decorations." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only if you earn more than £200 a year to meet these needs, you can have a happy family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "So, in order not to delay your time and not cause misunderstanding, I think it is necessary to introduce it in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a lawyer, Jurgen was a moment I couldn't find a language rebuttal. Fortunately, he had only serious and serious expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, income is very important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only if the annual income exceeds 400 pounds, it is possible to hold this level of dinner to make your wife beautiful. The dress and the delicate earrings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starling suddenly lifted his chin and tried to suppress the smile:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"430 pounds, I mean, there is some savings every year, to prevent accidents or to invest in stock bonds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is her husband Probable annual income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After helping the strangers find the topic, she left here and greeted other guests, and Klein clearly noticed that Sarah, Angela and other lawyers for Ergen More interested, after all, the other party is not bad, work and income are very stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for private detectives who may enter the police station at any time, it is not a priority for middle-class women, and Klein is now a beard, slightly rough, girls They are inevitably a little afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat with a few chats and found an excuse to leave, hiding in the corner, eating while enjoying the help of Jurgen and helpless performance . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, his eloquence as a lawyer did not know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, the two children of Summer's family ran across Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They noticed the gentleman hiding in the corner, stopped, stared at the big eyes, curiously asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moriarty, I heard that you are a detective?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Klein smiled and responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl said innocently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can tell us about your broken case "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her twin brother nodded again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I broke the case? It’s not about resentment, secrets, devils, or finding cats. It’s really not suitable for children.... Kline thought for a few seconds, hehe laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, this is a story about the treasure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An officer who retired from East Byron was suddenly taken Murder..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detective novels he has seen in his life have actually forgotten almost, can only be fabricated according to the vague impression, and the two children I don't care about the unreasonable circumstances, I listened very seriously, and even learned to ask "the next thing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, Klein relaxed a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dinner was coming to an end, he was about to leave, but he saw that Starling’s face was full of joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to be celebrated?" Klein asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stalene raised her head and smiled slyly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mary got air pollution At the invitation of Mr. Hibbert Hall, the chief secretary of the investigation committee, he will go to his home for a luncheon on Monday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This gentleman is Earl of Hall The eldest son, the real aristocrat, invited all members of the committee and allowed them to bring two or three friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stalelin got off the road :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marine just invited me and Luke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday at noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
