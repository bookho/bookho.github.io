			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 Minsk Street, in a damp, cold kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned to find a new big iron pot, poured it into water, and brushed it carefully several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he threw a few matches into it and slammed his finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red flame rises, and under his control, the residual water droplets are quickly dried without hurting the surface of the iron pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——This time there is no pure water in the potion formula, so Klein is more careful than the previous two, so as not to add extra aid, free What big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the success of the potion modulation is successful, he can divination and not harm his life, but the result is that the potion is scrapped, think again It is quite difficult to extract the extraordinary characteristics inside. Just like removing the mental pollution of the loser, there must be corresponding skills, methods or rituals, and Klein can't get the second material in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete the preparation, look at the boxes that are neatly arranged, Klein took a breath, and finally recalled the potion recipe:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Face: The main material, the pituitary of the brain of the Thousand Face Hunter, the characteristics of the shadow of the human skin, the auxiliary material, the blood of the Thousand Face Hunter 80 ml, 5 drops of black mandala juice, 10 grams of dragon tooth grass powder, 3 hairs of deep sea Naga."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first picked up from the vampire Emlin White's carton, open it, and remove the glass bottle containing 100 ml of the face of the hunter's blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After aiming at the eye tick, Klein unscrewed the lid and the wrist slowly poured into the iron pot and changed its color at any time due to light changes. Viscous liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is an auxiliary material, he did not pursue precision too much, and did not use chemical experiments to dispense and titrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of hunter's blood seems to be thin honey, slowly filling the bottom of the iron pot, Klein feels almost the same, stop tilting, let the liquid return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are almost 20 ml left, the spiritual intuition is quite accurate... Klein took his eyes off the glass bottle and tightened the lid. The 20 ml Thousand-faced Hunter's blood can be used to make magical items, extraordinary weapons, extraordinary scrolls, or to be responsible for sketching symbols in certain ritual magic, still very precious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After putting the glass bottle back into the cotton-filled carton, Klein added black mandala juice and dragon tooth powder in order, seeing iron The liquid cockroaches in the pot blew up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a pause, he picked up three dark blue hairs like snakes with the right palm of the black glove and placed them firmly on the liquid surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a faint mist in the iron pot, and the color of the liquid becomes dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as the singular effect of the main material... It’s the potion of the sequence 6... Klein grabbed the vampire Emlin White. A silver and white tin box with a gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, Klein opened the lid and presented the walnut-like items inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not directly touch the brain of the thousands of hunters, and placed the tin box directly above the iron pot, and overturned it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow-brown objects with raised lines and depressions of the brain fall and collide with the dark blue liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there is no splash of water, and the shape of the pituitary is silent and melts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray, yellow and brown colors quickly merge with the dark blue, and the bubbles that pop up become bigger and bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Klein was already nervous, but still managed to control himself, picking up the last box and putting a huge diamond-like person inside. The shadow of the shadows fell into the iron pan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, all the water mists converge, and even the light of the gas wall lamp has been attracted and swallowed, and it has faded a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything was back to normal, Klein could see what the final shaped potion looks like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's all black and green, from time to time, slowly popping out an eye-sized bubble, just like having a life, hitting it every few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bubble reaches the surface and will immediately rupture, and in the process, it shines and reflects various colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These colors are jointly sketched into different faces, and the five senses seem to be randomly combined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein single-handedly picked up the iron pan and poured the liquid into the pre-prepared glass bottle. There was no residue due to the characteristics of the potion. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use divination to confirm that the degree of harm is acceptable, that is, after the potion is successfully deployed, Klein takes the bottle of "no face" and returns steadily. On the second floor, I entered the bedroom that had already been curtained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-locking the door of the house, he sat down to the edge of the bed, with meditation, calmed down the feeling of a little excitement and anxiety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sitting for ten seconds, Klein unscrewed the cap and raised his right hand, slamming all the potions inside into the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of a slight tingling reverberates in his mouth and esophagus, eventually fermenting into paralysis that makes people lose their senses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s spirit seems to have been pulled out of his body, using a bystander’s gesture to see his mouth melting and his nose melting. The ears are melting, the eyes are melting, and the whole face is melting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just two or three seconds, his face, his head, became a white wax that was roasted by fire, and his body had similar abnormalities. Both the bones and the skin seem to be dissolved by the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you can't let this situation develop! Klein knows that if he is not well controlled, he will be on the verge of losing control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Onlookers" he tried to get his thoughts back to his body, trying to see the superimposed image of layers of light balls, trying to maintain the state of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short but repeated attempt, he finally felt his body and tried his best to control the tiny parts to stabilize the final bottom line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melting and dissolving again and again, Klein did not know how long it lasted, and finally waited until the end, and regained the feeling that the body belongs to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he knew that he had finally passed the threshold and entered the sequence 6 and became a "no face"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't sweat, but his spirit was extremely exhausted. He barely stood up and walked toward the full-length mirror, trying to observe what he was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the illumination of the gas fireplace, he jerked back two steps and slammed the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene in the mirror is unusual! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw his face and bare skin covered with dense granules, which would make all normal creatures only witness, Ma, it is subconscious to resist, timid, and may even lose reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the law, I have thoroughly digested the "Magic" potion, and the promotion sequence 6 is quite difficult, only two or three steps away from control, those relying on Time accumulates, the extraordinary person who is reluctant to take the corresponding potion does not know how much risk he will bear, and the probability of failure is certainly not low... No wonder the internal sequence 7 of the churches is more common, serving as the captain and bishop of the relative grassroots. In sequence 6, the number of people began to plummet... Klein closed his eyes and stepped back into the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He uses the "meditation" approach to converge on the overflowing spirituality and return to exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After about ten minutes, the disgusting granules on his body all faded and merged into the flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coke, Klein breathed a sigh of relief and walked back to the full-length mirror, looking at himself with a beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, those beards began to wriggle, and flesh and blood and skin were like semi-dissolved wax blocks, and strange changes took place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
