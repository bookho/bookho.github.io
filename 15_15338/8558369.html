			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a magnificent palace propped up by a stone pillar, Klein sits on a high back chair, tapping the edge of the mottled long table with his fingers, first looking for the sun The route sequence 4 "no dark" is ruled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because he has little contact with the "Eternal Liyang" church, it is difficult to find someone to help, and second, he suspects that "no dark" may not be able to purify The spiritual pollution in the "All Black Eyes" is lost. After all, the "hidden" Jia Delia's suggestion is aimed at the legacy of the ordinary runaways, and this comes from the "real creator"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not realistic to seek the help of angels or true gods. In theory, I can divination in this mysterious space above the fog. ', with his spontaneous counterattack to smash 'All Black Eyes', evaporate spiritual pollution, but the problem is that if there is 'experience', he might be able to invade here and take up the fog, then I will lose more than...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And that kind of power that exceeds my current level of unawareness, no delay, for myself, I have no time or ability to direct it to all black The eye's lack of room for operation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, not that divination can be divined, there is a medium, before the use of the "eternal yang" blood of the variation of the sun, It is the 'ear' that has been polluted by the 'real creator'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are media in the 'Men' and 'Hidden Sage', which can pass the 'Magician' 'Miss's full moon slang and 'star above' are tried by the chasing of knowledge, but there is also the problem of 'counterattack' not pointing to 'all black eyes', and I can't transfer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Azick has not recovered yet, 'The Snake of the Destiny' Will Wealthing is not yet born, I want to come and think, I can't find an angel to help me. Oh, I still know that there are too few high-level big men... Yes, there is a wicked spirit in the underground relic of Beckland, which is suspected to be the king of angels, Medici! But this guy is deep-minded and hiding. I don't know how much conspiracy and malice, there is really no other way, I can't consider it at all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s not worth it to take such a risk, so I might as well give up 'All Black Eyes', re-collecting the main material of the 'Secret Master', which is the core of the ancient wraith dust and the six-winged gargoyle, the former may be in the underworld! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this way, re-collection is an idea. Finding a magical item like a 'vascular thief' is another way of thinking, with fog shielding, I The ability to play the stealing ability can definitely separate the 'real creator' mental pollution in the 'black eye' without fear of its return.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The easiest operation is to throw away the contaminated magical items to a distant place, and then bring the pure 'black eyes' back to the real world, so that the two sides are 'physically' isolated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... Where should I go to find similar magical items? The gentleman did not speak after reading the method, indicating that he did not know, but You can still ask at the Tarot next time, 'Misser', Miss 'Justice', 'Magician', Little 'Sun' and Emlin White. There are channels and resources... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This week I tried to find myself, starting with 'Iceberg Lieutenant', her three 'flower bow tie' Jodson had 'stealing' This extraordinary ability may know where there are similar magic items. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gradually sorted out his thoughts and had a preliminary plan.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did it first After a divination, he quickly returned to the real world, got rid of the decadent state of drinking newspapers in the easy chair and reading the newspapers. He quickly arranged the ceremony.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still three candles, But the difference is that the painted pattern is replaced by the sacred emblem of "the god of knowledge and wisdom" - the omniscient eye on the spread of books, and the ceremonial silver enamel is also replaced by a brass knife - in occultism, corresponding The "King of Knowledge and Wisdom" is Blue Star, and the metals in the Blue Star field are mercury and brass.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has long considered to contact "Iceberg "The problem with Edwina Edwards, so there is a set of materials for the "Linging Ceremony". After some operation, he burned the corresponding herbal powder, dripped the essence and pure extract extracted with lavender and mint. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh, elegant, mysterious fragrance, Klein stepped back, using Gu Hermi Sri Lankan mourning mantra:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for the power of knowledge;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray The power of reason;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for the care of the god of wisdom;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray that you will let me with the 'teacher of knowledge, the researchers of the spiritual world, the iceberg above the sea Lieutenant General, Edwina Edwards of Rømberg's spiritual communication. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s voice reverberated and the altar became cold. Whether it is a brass sacred or a metal vial, it floats all over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successfully, the "Golden Dream" is still within 500 nautical miles... Klein is a while Happy, and then saw the flames of the three candles stretched a little, dyed pale, with a bit of green.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——He knows the essence of the "departure ceremony" It is to let go of your body, let the target's astral body adhere, complete effective communication, and it will lack the necessary protection. It is easy to be invaded by the "death ritual", so it is necessary to do divination in advance and judge things. The degree of danger, and, by meeting and talking, he believes that "Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina is not a malicious person, and can be trusted for the time being.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This At the time, the wind in the wall of the spirits smothered the effect of whimpering. Klein felt that the power of a cold, cold and cold came from nothingness. Trying to get into your body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he suddenly found himself not allowed to be attached to the other person as expected, with sufficient countervailing power and room for manoeuvre <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is going on here? When he thought about it, he saw a thin, invisible fog around his body.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the special thing that he only had when he was promoted to “No Face Man”. The power of fog has penetrated into reality!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts During the electric turn, Klein didn't hesitate, slammed his arm and pointed at the coat rack with the coat hanging, throwing the cold and cold power away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; On the coat rack, his black-brown coat floated up in a strange way, and his arms were raised and awkward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like having one The invisible man put on his coat!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black coat was floated two meters before it, then paused.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's Article lift sleeves, staggered into the "×" shape <br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; What does this mean? Klein stunned and immediately understood the meaning of "Iceberger": <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the mouth, I can't talk! I can't write without the palm of my hand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit embarrassing... Klein thought about it and said it straightforwardly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Need a magical item that can steal someone's extraordinary ability, don't know if you have a woman?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If not, can you help me ask your three? , 'Flower Bow Tie' Mr. Jodson? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The corresponding answer can be written in the letter, summoning my messenger to send it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black The sleeves of the coat were unfolded and made a downward pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it lost its soul and slammed into the ground, no longer so straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meaning "good"? Klein sighed silently, busy ending the ceremony, hanging the black coat on the coat rack and cleaning it with a brush and a handkerchief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he wrote a letter and asked Mr. Azick on a similar question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blowing the copper whistle, recruiting the messenger, and taking the letter, Klein tried very hard to try the third method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the thousand paper cranes from the wallet, carefully unfolded and wrote on it with a pencil:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where can I get magical items that steal the extraordinary ability of others?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the pencil, Klein follows the grain and completes the thousand papers. The restoration of the crane is very gratifying to the progress of his craft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
