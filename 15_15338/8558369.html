			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a magnificent palace propped up by a stone pillar, Klein sits on a high back chair, tapping the edge of the mottled long table with his fingers, first looking for the sun The route sequence 4 "no dark" is ruled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because he has little contact with the "Eternal Liyang" church, it is difficult to find someone to help, and second, he suspects that "no dark" may not be able to purify The spiritual pollution in the "All Black Eyes" is lost. After all, the "hidden" Jia Delia's suggestion is aimed at the legacy of the ordinary runaways, and this comes from the "real creator"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not realistic to seek the help of angels or true gods. In theory, I can divination in this mysterious space above the fog. ', with his spontaneous counterattack to smash 'All Black Eyes', evaporate spiritual pollution, but the problem is that if there is 'experience', he might be able to invade here and take up the fog, then I will lose more than...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And that kind of power that exceeds my current level of unawareness, no delay, for myself, I have no time or ability to direct it to all black The eye's lack of room for operation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, not that divination can be divined, there is a medium, before the use of the "eternal yang" blood of the variation of the sun, It is the 'ear' that has been polluted by the 'real creator'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are media in the 'Men' and 'Hidden Sage', which can pass the 'Magician' 'Miss's full moon slang and 'star above' are tried by the chasing of knowledge, but there is also the problem of 'counterattack' not pointing to 'all black eyes', and I can't transfer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Azick has not recovered yet, 'The Snake of the Destiny' Will Wealthing is not yet born, I want to come and think, I can't find an angel to help me. Oh, I still know that there are too few high-level big men... Yes, there is a wicked spirit in the underground relic of Beckland, which is suspected to be the king of angels, Medici! But this guy is deep-minded and hiding. I don't know how much conspiracy and malice, there is really no other way, I can't consider it at all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s not worth it to take such a risk, so I might as well give up 'All Black Eyes', re-collecting the main material of the 'Secret Master', which is the core of the ancient wraith dust and the six-winged gargoyle, the former may be in the underworld! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this way, re-collection is an idea. Finding a magical item like a 'vascular thief' is another way of thinking, with fog shielding, I The ability to play the stealing ability can definitely separate the 'real creator' mental pollution in the 'black eye' without fear of its return.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The easiest operation is to throw away the contaminated magical items to a distant place, and then bring the pure 'black eyes' back to the real world, so that the two sides are 'physically' isolated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... Where should I go to find similar magical items? The gentleman did not speak after reading the method, indicating that he did not know, but You can still ask at the Tarot next time, 'Misser', Miss 'Justice', 'Magician', Little 'Sun' and Emlin White. There are channels and resources... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This week I tried to find myself, starting with 'Iceberg Lieutenant', her three 'flower bow tie' Jodson had 'stealing' This extraordinary ability may know where there are similar magic items. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gradually sorted out his thoughts and had a preliminary plan.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did it first After a divination, he quickly returned to the real world, got rid of the decadent state of drinking newspapers in the easy chair and reading the newspapers. He quickly arranged the ceremony.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still three candles, But the difference is that the painted pattern is replaced by the sacred emblem of "the god of knowledge and wisdom" - the omniscient eye on the spread of books, and the ceremonial silver enamel is also replaced by a brass knife - in occultism, corresponding The "King of Knowledge and Wisdom" is Blue Star, and the metals in the Blue Star field are mercury and brass.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has long considered to contact "Iceberg "The problem with Edwina Edwards, so there is a set of materials for the "Linging Ceremony". After some operation, he burned the corresponding herbal powder, dripped the essence and pure extract extracted with lavender and mint. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh, elegant, mysterious fragrance, Klein stepped back, using Gu Hermi Speaking of the mantra:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for the power of reason;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for the care of the god of wisdom;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Pray that you will let me communicate with the 'teacher of knowledge, the researchers of the spiritual world, the iceberg lieutenant above the sea, the spirit of Edwina Edwards from Rømberg."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s voice reverberates, and the altar becomes cold, regardless of brass sacred or metal The vials, all floated up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful, the "Golden Dream" is still within 500 nautical miles... Klein was delighted for a while, then saw the flames of the three candles grow a little longer and got infected. Pale, with a bit of green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--He knows that the essence of the "Golden Ritual" is to let go of his body, let the target's astral body adhere, complete effective communication, and it will lack The necessary protection is easily invaded by the "death ritual", so divination is done in advance to judge the danger of the matter, and, by meeting and talking, he thinks that "Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina is not a A malicious person can trust for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the wind in the wall of the spirits smothered the effect of choking, and Klein felt that the power of a cold and cold chill came from nothingness, trying to enter Your own body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he suddenly found himself not allowed to be attached to the other party as expected, with sufficient countervailing power and room for manoeuvre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is going on? When he thought his movements, he vaguely saw a thin, invisible fog around his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the special thing that he only possessed after he was promoted to "no face", and the power of fog has penetrated into reality! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking in the electric turn, Klein did not hesitate, slammed his arm and pointed to the coat rack with the coat hanging, throwing the cold and cold power The past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the coat rack, his black-brown coat floated up in a strange way, and his arms were raised and awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like having an invisible person put on his coat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black coat was floated two meters before it, then paused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sleeves are raised and staggered into an "X" shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean? Klein stunned and immediately understood the meaning of "Iceberger": <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the mouth, I can't talk! I can't write without the palm of my hand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit embarrassing... Klein thought about it and said it straightforwardly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Need a magical item that can steal someone's extraordinary ability, don't know if you have a woman?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If not, can you help me ask your three? , 'Flower Bow Tie' Mr. Jodson? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The corresponding answer can be written in the letter, summoning my messenger to send it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black The sleeves of the coat were unfolded and made a downward pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it lost its soul and slammed into the ground, no longer so straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meaning "good"? Klein sighed silently, busy ending the ceremony, hanging the black coat on the coat rack and cleaning it with a brush and a handkerchief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he wrote a letter and asked Mr. Azick on a similar question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blowing the copper whistle, recruiting the messenger, and taking the letter, Klein tried very hard to try the third method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the thousand paper cranes from the wallet, carefully unfolded and wrote on it with a pencil:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting a pencil, Klein followed the lines and completed the restoration of the thousand paper cranes. He was very pleased that his craftsmanship was not small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Klein browses the prayers of believers and returns to reality In the world, I went to the bathroom to make a very comfortable hot bath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allowed him to fall asleep quickly after he got into the bed, until he was shocked by the power of invasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the bleak plain, the towering spire, and Klein’s skillful passage through the wall, all the way to the depths of the tower . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still scattered deputy tarot cards, which are placed around the raised ground of the center, which seems to indicate what it is, can be regarded as the "divination" Ryan can only make a chaotic and contradictory interpretation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the raised area, the text has been updated, and the silvery words make up three sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first sentence says:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just a child who has not yet been born." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s expression was stagnation, as if he heard a baby crying: I beg you, don’t be embarrassed, this communication is very tired...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second sentence is equally concise:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The clue is on yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third sentence is:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't ask what clues, because I don't know."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, "The Snake of the Destiny" Will Unsetin foresaw the clue on me, but couldn't foresee what it was... it was a kind of divination No, you can't say that, you can't push yourself in... Klein remembers the prompt, withdraws from the dream, and falls asleep again until dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast, he began to think about the things and things he owned, looking for so-called clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, his inspiration suddenly touched and quickly opened the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white bone messenger is still huge, but unlike before, its head is no longer worn out of the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because it is drilled from the floor, and most of its body is on the bottom layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, it looks at Klein and puts the letter back in his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the messenger was disintegrating and falling like a waterfall, Klein snorted for two seconds and whispered in a gasy and funny way:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Politeness!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More and more thoughtful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since I know I won’t be transferred to me, it’s a big change...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Ryan quickly regained his sight, unfolded the letter, and read Mr. Azick's reply: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the way to steal other people's extraordinary ability is the 'stealer' approach, In the Quaternary, it belonged to the Amun family, the Zoroastrian family and the Jacob family... After the 'Four Emperors' battle, they rarely appeared again. It is said that some of the people formed an alliance and became self-proclaimed. The hermit of destiny.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More content I can't remember, you can start from the descendants of these three families. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amon... The original "God of the Gods" refers to this route? The Jacob family is one of the five angelic families of the Tudor dynasty, with Abraham, A Mon, Antigonus and Tamara also said that the Zoroastrian family is the Solomon empire... the hermit of destiny, destiny, hermit... clues on my own... Klein suddenly sat up, thinking An item.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
