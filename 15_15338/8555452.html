			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Essinger Stanton’s proposal, Klein did not react much. He looked at the closed living room doorway: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I know, the 'demon' can anticipate danger before we act, and even determine the source of danger, so as to respond effectively.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have a hard time finding and dragging him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger sighs first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it is true, but There is no way to solve it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? "Caslana immediately asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I and He fought positively and saw his extraordinary ability to foresee danger, so he initially figured out its strengths and weaknesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 'devil' can indeed detect danger in advance, even for a long time in advance, as long as we make plans for him and put it into action, then He will have a corresponding hunch, of course, that must really harm him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the truth is, different kinds of "devils" in this regard The strength is different, and some may only be noticed ten or twenty minutes in advance... Klein silently refuted a sentence in his heart, but did not say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger continues: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The drawback of this predictive ability is that it can only Perceive the source of the danger, where it comes from, and the specific details, which gives us the opportunity to use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What opportunity? I don't Think that we can let a demon who can predict danger fall into our trap." Kaslana asked in disbelief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein also nodded next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I can use the fog to deceive the "desire apostle" so that he can't detect danger too long in advance, but the question is, how can I be in front of others? The secret of exposure to fog... Klein silently added a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Normally it doesn't work, but the extraordinary world is always Full of all sorts of incredible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the sequence of the 'Reader' route 7 'Shouzhi', also called 'Detective', I tell you frankly Is the sincerity of showing cooperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this environment, I think frankness is more important than other elements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Only sequence 7? Can a sequence 7 escape from the "desire apostle"? It seems that Mr. Stanton has powerful magical items... Klein has adjusted his posture slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "The Guardian can restrain the demon's ability to predict danger?" Kaslana asked in front of her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Essinger smiled. "But I have a ring that comes from a runaway sequence of the 'reader' route, which It allows me to identify, see, remember and simulate all the extraordinary abilities I have seen. Of course, the stronger the extraordinary ability, the higher the probability of failure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Haha, there is a maxim in our church, and omniscience means omnipotence. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sounds so familiar... especially the description of the item... Klein is about to start recalling, seeing Essinger Stanton come out A brilliant ring.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ring is inlaid with a lot of fine diamonds, which are surrounded by a beautiful green gem like the human eye.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only seeing this ring, Klein was dizzy and seemed to be over-excited.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ring was the "eye of wisdom" to show off to him, and used the seal "2-081" several times in the extraordinary party! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eye of Wisdom... This code sounds like the church of knowledge and wisdom... Klein uses the power of the "clown" to control the expression, not moving Sensitively, Essinger Stanton was looked at. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he found that the outline of the big detective did match the "eye of wisdom", but it was very different in many details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to camouflage is very strong...have the ability to use "2-081"? Klein has roughly judged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he thought of a scene:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr. Stanton said "everyone cooperates Confronting the 'desire apostle', the most important thing is frankness, I have described my sequence and magical items, it’s your turn," what should I say? Silently took out the "sun brooch" bought from him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When is the time, will he come up with a sentence, "Wow, it turns out to be your kid!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the occasion of Klein’s imagination, Caslana looked at the ring exhibited by Essinger Stanton, and some envious and somewhat puzzled asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to simulate against the 'Aspirations of the Desire' to predict the danger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aisin Glitched the corner of his mouth and chuckled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The demon's ability to predict danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he is like a white-haired fox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? Is this OK? Klein didn't want to understand how to operate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing him and Kaslana’s doubts, Essinger smiled and explained:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The first step, that is, what we are doing, is to plan a plan that can effectively harm the 'desire apostle' and put it into action.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" , 'Desire Apostle' perceives danger and knows that the danger comes from us, from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The third step, as a demon, some instincts can't be changed without pre-preparation. His first reaction must be to kill the danger or Revenge us, and there will be some physical changes, then he will consider whether the current situation is not suitable for counterattack, whether to choose to stay away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Step 4, simulation Out of the demon's predictive ability, I perceive the threat of the 'desire apostle' and grasp where the danger comes from, that is, where he is currently. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...God operation... Klein was almost shocked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but follow-up When the "desire apostle" discovered the problem, he would immediately run away. We simply couldn’t catch up... He immediately came up with new doubts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger I looked at the two people and smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to my inference, he is now hiding around, and can remotely manipulate other people's emotions. There is also a distance limit. And he just had to guide Stuart and others to get out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After I escaped the tracking, I waited until now to come because of the two parties, the heart of the machine and the military, and they each sent two To the three squads, responsible for a certain area around, these areas have their own code, huh, huh, this is the treatment that the 'desire apostle' can anticipate in advance, even if it is dangerous, he will think it is normal.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will inform the official extraordinary as soon as I determine his position, they will quickly block the corresponding area, surrounded by layers. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the question is, how do we notify the official extraordinary? If you can't finish this in a matter of seconds, the ‘Desire Apostle’ will escape. Of course, he may have been far away after the action was not successful. Klein thought and said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately took out a palm-sized gold item, which looks like a narrow telegraph machine, but also has a horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a seal that will make my voice ring within five kilometers at the same time." Essinger smiled and said, "The negative impact is Once activated, the sounds of the surrounding five kilometers will be transmitted to the user's ear for a long time. Of course, I can simulate an extraordinary ability to reduce this effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Caslana listened carefully and frowned slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since there are official extraordinary people, you don't seem to need to cooperate with us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eisinger carefully and cautiously put on the seal "2-081", sincerely said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "In order not to disturb the 'Aspirations of the Apostles' in advance, the nearest regional power gap is ours. If the goal is really here, we need three of us to help each other and try to delay him."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no problem." Klein agreed to it with a little thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caslana also nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Stanton, this does not really need you Explaining so much, we will cooperate for ourselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, the explanation is part of the plan, and reaching an agreement means the action is about to begin..." Singer closed his eyes halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wore the ring on his right hand, and the green gems shimmered in the blue and near black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Essinger Stanton stood up and pointed heavily at the top:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "He is here, just upstairs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and Kaslana got up at the same time, one ready to make a snap and ignite the match on the second floor. Jump straight up, one followed Essinger and ran to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t expect the “desire apostle” to be so bold. After the failure of the action, they stayed nearby and stayed at No. 15 Minsk Street! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we discuss the plan to deal with him, he is watching this all the way upstairs! Klein Horan came up with such an idea. At this moment, he saw that Kaslana’s eyes suddenly turned red, his right hand became a fist, and he slammed into the vest of Essinger Stanton! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...Klein's pupil shrinks and understands a lot of things:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Desire Apostles" The reason why he did not escape is because he still has layout! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also buried fallen seeds in someone’s heart without catalysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That person is Caslana! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the only three extraordinary people here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unsuccessful and easily resolved turmoil was actually to relax everyone’s vigilance and wait until the crucial moment to let Kaslana get out of control! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest goal of the "desire apostle" remains Isinger Stanton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really... Klein slammed his fingers, but only made an air bullet and fired at Kaslana’s air bullets. At the same time, he shouted: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger is also experienced, no matter what the situation, directly fell forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caucaslana ignored the bullet, letting the arm it hit, letting the blood splatter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
