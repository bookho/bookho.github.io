Klein muttered twice, reaching for a hand from the dark red round table next to it. Root pencil, circle the message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the day after tomorrow, if there is no commission, he plans to see if the so-called new type of transportation has investment value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This kind of thing cannot be pre-dubbed because there is not enough information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hope is a bicycle-like product..." Klein just silently said a word, and his ears suddenly echoed the illusory prayers of layers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who? Miss "Justice"? "Down man"? "Sun" classmates? Or someone in Beckland Bank who copied my password? Klein had a flash of thought, put down the newspaper, went back to the bedroom, and locked the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take four steps back into the fog, he saw the edge of the ancient mottled bronze long table, the side of the Fool’s seat, a clear brilliance The circle is open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experienced Klein sat down calmly, spread out of spirituality, and responded to the praying gesture to touch the light of the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene in front of him changes violently, presenting a set of fuzzy sofas with a petite woman dressed in a trainer's costume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No transcripts...When reading a piece of paper... Klein suddenly woke up and figured out why:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She should be one of the two extraordinary people mentioned by Miss 'Justice' who need me to examine..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking for a dozen seconds Klein didn't really respond, and planned to do this in the middle of the night, and then examine her personality and ability from the other's reaction, attitude and handling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he will never force others to join the Tarot Club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Followers who are not in this era..." Just finished The paragraph of the ancient Hermes language rested for a few seconds, a back of the waist, slammed straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems probably probably a secret name! She was aware of this in horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her occult common sense and all sorts of rumors she heard told her:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading a complete name of a hidden existence, it often means attracting the attention of the other party! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequences of such gaze are not great, and may even be miserable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hidden existences are many incarnations of evil spirits! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I still mourn in the unprotected ancient Hermes... I am stupid, why should I use my heart to identify, seriously meditate... Around, I was afraid of a monster in a quiet house that could not be described by words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sofas, coffee tables, cabinets, dining tables, chairs, paintings and other items are reflected in her eyes without any change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be warned for a few tens of seconds, Hugh relaxed a little, self-comforting:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am afraid that I am not afraid. I just read the name and did not follow the prayer script."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is an incomplete ritual and should not be attracted. Gaze."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, but I heard that if the evil spirits of the evil spirits have an interest, even if the ceremony is incomplete, they will respond... I am stupid, really..." Thinking about it, Hugh and crying a face, feeling that he committed A serious mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting a few more minutes, see no clear response, took a break from the gang, and slowly vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clipped the paper back to the book "The History of the Aristocrats of the Kingdom of Lun", feeling a little heavy into the bathroom, unscrewing the faucet, intending to wake up with cold water a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearly transparent water flows down, rests low back, stretches out the palms, and holds a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was about to smear cold water on her face, and the corner of her eye suddenly saw a long, slightly curled brown hair in the wash mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she is shoulder-to-shoulder, messy yellow hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, Hughogen’s hair brushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pressed hard under her feet, her hands slammed, and suddenly popped back, half-turned, one elbow slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She relied on a warm body, hitting the other side to make a familiar scream and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh stopped the follow-up action, looking at the friend who was holding his stomach, painful, and tearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of her mouth twitched unconsciously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"False, when are you coming back? ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falth did not answer immediately, and after a while, stood up against the wall and complained:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just, just come back, Hugh, are you crazy? Don't see it clearly! Let's make such a heavy hand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Where did you come in?" asked in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you come in through the window of the bathroom, why, is there a problem? As an 'apprentice', it is normal to have no key." I replied eloquently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a break, he straightened his back and pushed all the responsibilities back:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't walk the door? You just scared me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls licked his eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s still half a circle, it’s too much trouble, I am used to going straight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused and wondered: "However, Hugh "Your reaction is too intense?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh struggled for three seconds between losing face and losing his life, and replied frankly:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because, because I made a mistake, a fatal mistake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?" Fols He groaned and asked with concern and concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurry to find a mezzanine on his own, find an old piece of paper, and accidentally identify the ancient Hemy's language that is suspected of a hidden name. The mantra of the mantra was originally told. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, your brain? Yes, there should be nothing, the ceremony is not complete, and who knows whether it is true or not..." Foers looked around Inexplicably, I feel a bit cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She followed her back to the living room, saw the yellowed paper, saw the Russell special symbol above and the ancient Hermes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance, the professional occult researcher, Firth, sighs first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And there has been no incident so far, indicating that there should be no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the break, she thinks of the pain in her stomach, "maliciously" added: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, what is going on, with our ability, can't help ourselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hugh’s face turned white and blurted out: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fols, we are together tonight, forget it, I still sleep myself..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fols moved his eyebrows, hehe smiled: "Well, actually don't worry, you think, I will hear strange proverbs every full moon, but also There are no signs of madness or loss of control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well...we have studied the other three books. If you have the same paper and mantra, it means very It may be the prank of the Viscount Glylint."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are busy turning out books such as Heraldic, and carefully check it again, no extra hair . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After watching Foers, Fols looked at Hugh, and the atmosphere became condensed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or, tonight, we sneak into the Mass Hall of the Church of St. Sayre to sleep?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the headquarters of the Beckland Parish of the Goddess of the Night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not the Church of St. Hillland? I don't think the goddess of the night will bless me..." Folsch came back with a subconscious mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headquarters of the Beckland Parish of the Church of Steam and Machinery, in the St. George District, adjacent to many large factories in the southeast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ladies with different beliefs are silent again. After a while, Fols sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "And that will make us watched by the night, or the heart of the machine, this may be the purpose of the hidden existence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Go to sleep, wait until the morning to know the answer. If there is nothing happening at the time, it means there is really no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, the red moon is not covered by the dark clouds, and the sky of Beckland has rarely seen the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein instinctively woke up, and was taken out of bed and entered the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit to the high back chair belonging to the Fool, he is ready to respond to the "Justice" lady's companion, let things into the "examination process." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, he suddenly had a new idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maybe try one Can you pull people into the fog in this situation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady should fall asleep, even if my attempt is successful, she will probably think that it is just a clearer dream afterwards... um... if successful I will break it off in time to prevent her from seeing the surrounding scene...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; repeatedly scrutinizing for a while, Klein reached out to the constantly swaying aperture To establish a connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he only felt that his spirituality was pouring out in madness, causing the mysterious space above the fog to tremble slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein thought that his spirituality would be completely drained, everything calmed down and a blurry and distorted figure emerged from the edge of the bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a deep sleep, I opened my eyes, saw the innocent fog, saw an old high-backed chair, and saw the black shadow overlooking myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein’s heart was happy, and immediately cut off the contact according to the scheduled plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
