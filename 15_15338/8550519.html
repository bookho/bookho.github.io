Elizabeth asked with some unbelievable remarks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded and smiled noddedly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things are not difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above sentence is to lie to you...he is in his heart Silently added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps Klein has always been very calm, or perhaps it is the only piece of "floating board", Elizabeth did not doubt again, took a chest, Chang Shu mouth airway:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, you are a trustworthy gentleman, I was scared just now."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is Selena? Is she okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She may be asleep for a few minutes, but no other problem, Well, it’s normal to be weak for two or three days.” Klein said that he suddenly opened his face and opened his mouth seriously. “Who is her mysterious teacher? Didn’t she tell her basic taboos?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth stood up straight, like a student criticized by a teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Selina mentioned that her occult teacher is Henas Vansente, a year ago, she went to the divination club in the Halls district to divination and met the gentleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hainas. Fansent... He is supervised by the magic mirror divination, and privately, he is teaching "black divination"... I knew that I would inform the captain early, check his gas meter early... Klein was slightly upset. Shen Sheng asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Selina's magic divination is also taught by him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp For Klein, the thing that made him most afraid was that he almost affected his sister Melissa! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth carefully deliberately:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but before Selena tried several times The magic mirror divination has not been successful, the amount, she told me today, she peeked at her teacher's secret spell, certainly no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experts... Klein pinched his temples with a headache:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you remember the curse she mourned?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well... Although Heiners Vansente did not take the initiative to teach dangerous knowledge to Selena, it is obvious that he is trying to do it, and provoke an unknown, hidden existence. It’s just a matter of morning and evening, and it must be dealt with as soon as possible to avoid the situation worsening to affect others...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Remember some.” Elizabeth recalled, “She used mystery. In the study of Hermes, you know, I have just been in contact for a while, only remember that there are '徘徊', '英灵', 'creator', '眷属' Word."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creator? Real Creator? Many underground occult enthusiasts really believe in this ancient existence that is respected by many hidden organizations... Yes, in the early days of the Fifth Age, there was an ancient existence that appeared more than a thousand years ago! Klein nodded thoughtfully: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When Selena wakes up, you remember to ask the complete mantra and then look for a chance to tell me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Elizabeth answered quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she immediately wondered: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moretti, why are you not directly Ask her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want Melissa to know that I love occultism, can you keep it secret for me?" Klein did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, Melissa really likes mechanics over mystery, like reason over intuition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pressed the hand with the hat to the left chest, Gentleman likes: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your understanding, and Selena, you know, she is not a person who is good at keeping secrets."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" More accurately, she likes to share secrets with others." Elizabeth agrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wears a hat and thinks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for Selena to wake up, You remember telling her that she suddenly fainted and broke the mirror. I think her memory must remain at the beginning of the magic mirror for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Elizabeth nodded, and he again raised his face: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, whether you are divining or trying other occultal knowledge, don't go to seven Pray beyond the presence of the gods! See the mantra that does not belong to this type, burn it immediately, away from the provider!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today, if not I found it in time Wait another ten minutes, Selena will become a monster, become a evil spirit, and no one will survive, including me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking In the mirror of the cold "Selina", Elizabeth did not doubt Klein's words at all, but was afraid to sigh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, I remember, Will also supervise Selena."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you go in and take care of Selena." Klein raised the black cane with silver, stepping Going up the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When walking, his eyes turned deep, his eyes closed, and his right hand pulled out a 1 pence of copper coins, and when he slammed into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Selina has no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Selina has no problem." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quickly repeated this statement and reached for the tumbled drop The bronze coin, seeing the head of George III facing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a simplification of the "spiritual spelling", but a simplification of "dream divination". Just that moment, Klein used his meditation to force himself to fall asleep." God "tours the world, the front and back of the coin is a symbol of the explicit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The avatar is correct, the number is wrong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very good, no problem... Klein lets the brass-colored coins swirl at the fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplification that can only be done by the "Divination". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth stares at Klein’s back and sees the flying pennies. I saw the catching of the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Klein disappeared into the stairs, she turned to enter the bedroom and saw Selena slumbering on the floor, with glass fragments on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She held her breath, picked up her toes, looked at the pieces of the glasses, and confirmed that there was no more cold "Selina" inside and reflected the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, Elizabeth completely let go of her heart and sighed with relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after several efforts, she failed to get Selena to the bed, but she woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elizabeth... What happened to me? Are you drunk?" Selena asked a little weakly, her bright eyes were light and full, full of confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth thought for a few seconds, replied very seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it?" Selena helped the Elizabeth, and sat down on the edge of the bed, glaring at the temple. "I only remember that I just started to be divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Elizabeth half-truth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You just changed like a person, you in the mirror and the reality you are even different... ...I am scared, an excuse to surprise you, take you into the bedroom, grab your mirror, break it on the carpet, and then, you will faint."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goddess bless, you are normal now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I don't remember..." Selena whispered palely Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more she recalls, the more blank her head is, the more she feels scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, she looked up at the desk and found that the placement there was significantly different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? Selena thought hard, only vaguely remembering wearing a black tuxedo, wearing a half-high silk hat, not strong, not tall, but Very straight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Selina." Elizabeth solemnly said, "When I went to the underground trading market to buy amulets, I met a mysterious expert who told me I, at any time, do not pray to the existence of the seven gods, otherwise it will inevitably lead to disaster, promise me, don't try again, I just don't know if I can save you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina is also frightened and nodded in a hurry: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I will never try again. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, what exactly does the mantra of your magical divination mean? If you have the chance to meet the occultist again, I will help you. Ask." Elizabeth asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina glared at the temple and thought: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The true creator's genus, staring at the eyes of destiny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒, Da da. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Klein descended down the stairs, he carefully arranged the folds of the clothes and cleaned the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he took off the half-height silk hat and carried the silver-plated black cane and walked back to the long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where have you been? It’s almost ten minutes." Selena’s brother Chris just folded and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Washing room, then went to the second floor to meet a few Miss and Ms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I appreciate your directness." Chris Haha praised. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has red hair and a low profile in his family, wearing a pair of gold-rimmed glasses on his face, and his temperament is quite capable. He is an excellent lawyer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you know that I am going to stun your sister on the second floor, you certainly won’t say that... Klein is modest:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just discuss some academic issues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the hat on, returned to the seat, and waited until the next start, got two cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a corner, he saw a spade K, a square A. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m getting a good luck... Is this a reward for doing good? Klein took out the copper coins and prepared to bet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
