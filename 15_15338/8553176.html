			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens, the luxury villa of Earl of Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey is wearing a white napkin, watching the dining maid cut the bacon for himself, placing the double-sided full-flavoured omelet, and spreading the jam on the soft bread. Add sauce to the grilled mushrooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In real aristocratic families, maids are divided into many types, except for the maids, the maids in different bedrooms, the study maid, the living room maid, the room maid, the costume maid. , shoes maid, jewelry maid, dining maid, pulping maid, kitchen maid, in order to strictly correspond, one servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is a waste of manpower, for the nobility, decent is everything, not much debt, and will not lower the requirements of similar aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey drank a mouthful of maroon tea, letting the faint malt and rose scent reverberate in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, she heard her father, the House of Lords, and the great banker, Count Earl, muttered to the newspaper in his hand:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aurora is really crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora? Audrey squinted and curiously asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did they do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, baby, you don't want to know, they actually assassinated the ambassador of Intis, Baker, which is not good for them." Earl Hall shook his head as he flipped the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey's eldest brother, the eldest son of the Earl, Hibbert Hall swallowed the grilled mushrooms in his mouth and made his own opinion:<br />< Br /> /> </ br> <br /> The aristocratic child has a handsome face and a brilliant blond hair. No matter which angle he looks at, he has a classical sculpture-like beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, if so, they will not leave so much obvious evidence, and the Kingdom has too many new policies to enter the implementation phase recently, For a period of stable environment, we will not rush to open the war. What happened last night, I saw the newspaper this morning, and there are detailed passages and specific murderers, which are enough to explain the ideas of His Majesty the King and the Ministers." With your own child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey listened to his father and his brother discussing this issue, and it took a while to react:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Baker Lang was assassinated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mr. A succeeded? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He really is the Aurora? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately exposed is what Aurora will do, just to prove that this is done by him, not to deceive the last paragraph? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too fast and too efficient. I paid the first payment yesterday afternoon. I heard the result this morning, a good result! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey is a horror, it is a joy that is difficult to contain, and the joy is instinctual fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task entrusted by Mr. Fool’s deaf is so easy and simple, it’s definitely a joy to be happy, but Mr. A and his aurora behind him will show up. The strength and mobility that came out made Audrey feel subconscious and afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔, okay, I communicated with Gletlin yesterday and reached a loan agreement. As a Viscount, he should have been unobtrusive. The fundraising was successful... I will give the last paragraph to Mr. A in the past two days. Through Hugh and Fols, I can’t come out myself... I can’t go to Mr. A’s party again in two months. Fortunately, I There are other circles... Audrey has bitten the soft bread with jam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the breakfast is coming to an end, a small cake with cream, cherries and strawberries is delivered to her plate, and she calms down and suddenly feels contented<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillston District, Hugh and Fols looked at the newspaper in front of him, for a long time no extra action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This is what Mr. A did?" Hugh looked at his friend with shock and confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls turned the bracelet with a stone in his wrist and shook his head in the same breath:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Maybe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that Aurora will, but I don't know if Mr. A is a member of the Aurora."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be, after all, we gave him 2,000 pounds yesterday. There should be no other person who wants to assassinate the ambassador of Becker..." Hugh is not sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;False silent for a few seconds, suddenly lamented:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether or not Mr. A did We have to give him the remaining 8,000 pounds. No one can prove that he is not doing it. If we still want to mix this circle, we can't rely on it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "In any case, we are not saving... and we still have a reward of 500 pounds!" He said, and he was happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is, I always feel that it is very dangerous to go to Mr. A again..." Fols said, "When I delivered the final payment, I went there myself. This is good for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Hugh instinct is a bit uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will influence me to escape." Fols shook his wrist bracelet and said in a disgusting tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Hugh grabbed his rough blond hair and replied helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two were embarrassed about this matter, Mr. A’s new news was passed from the hidden contact channel, and he told them not to look for him. Save the remaining balances to several unregistered accounts in different banks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Hugh and Fols are relieved at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in a spacious room like a shrine, Mr. A wore a black robes with a hood, sitting in the darkness, whispering something devoutly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a statue that is nearly 3 meters in front of him, a person whose legs are tied by chains and connected upside down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This slinger has a unique vertical single eye of the giant, arms stretched out and placed into a cross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a man with a black robe cover came in, humbly swearing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Sir, I have already passed the message."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Mr. A did not say sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in the black robe cover asked with a question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not let Who is investigating who entrusted this task?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mr. A buried his head and voiced indifferently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must remember that this is a critical period."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We want to confuse the mainland, we must try to attract the attention of others to welcome the return of the Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha ha ha, cough Cough..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. A suddenly laughed, then coughed hard, coughing the whole person to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in the black robe hood immediately lowered his head and did not see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Mr. A finally calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He marched forward, his mouth pressed against the ground, and he hunted all the bloody pieces that had just coughed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilston District New Year Road 126. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A relaxed Klein did not follow Doragu Gail this time, chose his mistress Erica Taylor as the goal, anyway, the affliction is needed Two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful blonde painted with exquisite makeup, arrived in the Craig Club early in the rental carriage, Kline carrying a portable camera and various camouflage The luggage of the object, followed by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a room to rest?" He asked the club's hoarse badge on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid wearing a black and white dress politely laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, you follow this The waiter went upstairs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gently decapitated, led by the red vest waiter, along the steps, step by step to the second floor, just to see Ai Rika Taylor enters a lounge on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to see the pedestrians on the street, or the tennis court behind?" The red vest waiter asked attentively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Being on the street." Klein replied casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the arrangement of the red vest waiter, he and Elika Taylor's room were separated by two rooms, and the street outside the club's gate was also visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do next? Looking for an opportunity to sneak into, hide in the room, or climb the window to climb the outside of the pipe? Neither of these methods can hide the exaggerated flash, but the latter can be disguised as an outside sneak sneak, without suspicion of me, expelling me... but it is easy to be detected by Doragu and Elika... Use a spell to make them sleep? No, this will make the photo lack of persuasiveness, it must be the picture in the process...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one chance, it must be shot well enough...this Not the field I am good at, I am not a master of art... I will try to construct a new ritual magic, which is used to cover the ceremonial magic of the camera flash. Of course, the goddess may not respond to him...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein scrutinized the next action and saw a bodyguard on the silver mirror in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is still wearing the black gothic court dress, wearing a small, soft cap with the same color, pale hair, pale face and exquisite appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a way to cover up the flash of the camera?" Klein asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice did not fall, he saw the surface of the silver mirror swaying, a slightly transparent palm suddenly extended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodyguard lady was drilled out of the silver mirror and walked over to Klein, nodding her head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leaned down and leaned over, so she blended into the camera's lens little by little! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean’s mouth looked at the horror of the picture slightly, and it took me a long time to come back, pick up the portable camera and try it out in her lounge. Zhang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect is better than he expected, the flash is limited to the vicinity of the lens, and the imaging effect is quite good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it should now be called "spiritual camera"... Klein whispered, holding the camera, coming to the window, waiting patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, he saw Doragu Gail arriving in a carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
