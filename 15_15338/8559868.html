			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the "Golden Dream". There are signs of fire and Anderson. Klein took a step forward and leaned toward Daniz:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me to the captain's room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...good, okay." Daniz took back the anger瞪Anderson Hood’s sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first priority is to save the captain. It is most important to save the captain first... He constantly warns himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Golden Dream" first put down a small boat, then drove down the ramp, so that Klein no longer need to use the power of the spell, simply and easily set foot on the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson followed his side, completely ignoring the eyes of all the crew members of the "Golden Dream", walking around with a smile, looking around It's like going back to your own home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His psychological quality is absolutely super-class... um, even if he offended the half-god, he was forced to apologize in public, took over the commission, and turned his head to laugh and ridicule himself. Happy meal... Kline sighed a few words in his heart and headed for the "three pairs" of Jodson and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Mr. Spallo, I am the chief officer of this ship, Bruce Worth." One wearing a monocle, height The man of nearly 1 meter 8 politely took a ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"6200 pounds of "foodies"... "Iceberg Lieutenant" this pirate group, the bounty level is significantly lower than the "star above", not worthy It is a treasure hunter of part-time pirates... Klein uses the courtesy attitude and words of Galman Sparoth: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, I heard "You are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...haha, this is my honor, I am just a treasure hunter who dreams of becoming a craftsman but has to embark on the path of a gourmet. "Bruce Worth self-adjusted and pointed to a man next to him, "Our second deputy, 'singer' Olvers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The reward of 5,500 pounds... The extraordinary person on the "Golden Dream", the nickname is very strange. If you don't know that this is a subordinate of the pirate general, I definitely think it is a sea tour group, singing songs and eating. The food is going to be a bonfire party to find the treasures in the legend. It’s not too good... Klein turned his eyes to Olvers and nodded casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "singer" has a stone-like deep outline and a brilliant blond hair, with a melancholy smile at this time:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I am just praising the sun, and now, my sun is gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Klein almost A goose bump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it’s the Intis, it’s the same as singing, but unfortunately, I was in Seggar, I grew up in Lomburg and couldn’t learn. This ability." Anderson does not know whether to praise or slyly smile, after all, he has half of the Intis blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born in Segal, later went to study in Rumburg, um, it should be a church school, and "Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina is a classmate... Mr. Erfurs can be sure that he is the "sun" route, but the big probability is not the "eternal glory" church. Judging from his bounty, it should be sequence 6 "notary"... almost forgot, you have to tell the little " "The sun", his formula already has, and I don't know what he can exchange for this time... Klein grabbed the "flower bow tie" Jodson before the "foodie" Bruce Wals introduced "Bucket" Daniels and others: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have seen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not delay Time is up. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. "Bruce Wals breathed a sigh of relief and touched his short beard and walked to the cabin first.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not for Germain Sparo The reputation is very loud on the boat, and he doesn't want to be so polite.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Anderson deliberately slipped a few steps, with Daniz, Olvers Waiting side by side.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not wary of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we are not alert to you, we just want to stuff you in, see it? That gun! "Daniz is not afraid of the other party is the strongest hunter, after all, this is the "Golden Dream", there are many pirates, including the extraordinary of Sequence 7, Sequence 6. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson’s mouth snarls:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The person like me is actually not threatened, you think about it Your captain must hate me very much, hate me, or even say a word to me, is this not the most ideal state?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Niz opened his mouth, but said nothing, because he suddenly felt that the shit said it makes sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orvers, Jederson and others looked at Anderson’s eyes and subconsciously softened a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson snorted and looked ahead, his tone slightly whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You The vigilance is actually Gilman Sparo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Daniz asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is a madman, it really needs to be vigilant, but it is not an enemy at the moment... Daniz silently added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am assuming, if, this time, German I successfully found your captain and saved her. Will your captain have a good impression on him? And he looks good, has a cold beauty, and has strong strength. He has reached the rank of pirate general and the background is particularly mysterious. Sufficiently matched..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How...maybe...Daniz wanted to refute, but he couldn’t open his mouth, the more he thought it was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expressions of Orpheus and others slammed down a bit, and looked a little more in the eyes of the back of German Sparrow. Be alert and alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolve! The problem that was just provoked was solved... Anderson smiled and followed the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the captain's room, Klein first saw a bookcase that was surrounded by nearly a circle, filled with books of various kinds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general captain's room is a wine cooler... He silently sighed and went straight to the desk in front of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Daniz’s description, "Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina was missing while conducting the research, so the trace of the search for remnants is Klein. The purpose, when collecting enough information, he can once again go to the divination on the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there are a lot of things on the desk, there are white paper, a round belly pen, a convex ink bottle, a copper knife, and Some books that are not neatly stacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the middle of the desk, is a booklet bound with parchment, which is written on the dark brown surface in ancient Fossack with "Grosser "Travel" and other words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a collection of "Iceberg Lieutenant"? It comes from a mysterious, suspected to be related to the dragon family and the "miracle city" Levished... Is Edwina studying this before she disappeared? Klein looked at the book and instinctively made a guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Greman. Sparo is looking at the ancient book, Daniz reluctantly laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It has no problems, we have checked it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes? I doubt your level of care... Because someone has turned over and there is obviously no abnormality, Klein used his spiritual intuition to initially confirm that Daniz did not lie, then stretched his hand and asked casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you read this "Grossel Travels"?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
