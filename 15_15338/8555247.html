			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will. Onsetin is dead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it seems to have been dead for a while! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will this be a fake? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the child's body in amazement and suspiciously, and there were many ideas in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his cognition, Will Anthony is a child with a special child, possibly with the "monster" route 1 "Silver Snake" There is a certain amount of involvement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The divination game he played, he casually said, "Doctor, your luck will be worse", let Allen be unlucky for a long time; The crane can make Allen's star spirits be positioned in the spiritual world, infused with the revelation created by man; his whereabouts, even if Klein can only see one or two above the fog, it is difficult to get effective conclusions... How can a child die inexplicably? Dr. Allen died before he dreamed? What about his loved ones? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein blinked his eyes, endured strong nausea, scrutinized the highly decaying body and found some shredded Tarot in the surrounding soil. brand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spiritual instinct tells him that the high probability of the corpse in front of him is Will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really shocking and confusing... Go back to the fog and confirm that Will. Andrein is a fake death...etc. What is the relationship with me? I have long decided not to mix this thing deeply, so as not to be entangled by what "mercury snake", this may be more terrible than the seal "0-08"... Klein slammed back, scared The cemetery and Dr. Allen, who is scared to collapse, said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alarm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, good!" The grave guard first glimpsed and then answered with a voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the shovel and turned and ran outside the woods, as if there was a living corpse chasing him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just an ordinary person, not at all cautious. In this case, isn’t it to be wary of people around you? Exposing the back, it is easy to be photographed by a shovel... Klein glanced at the back of the gravekeeper and shook his head with a sigh. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was in the Tinker City Night Club, he saw a lot of case files and found that many of the victims were so ruined by their associates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein walked to Dr. Allen and bent over and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Nothing to be afraid of, he is already dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It’s already dead, it’s scary.” Allen calmed down and didn’t accept grams. Ryan’s help, climbed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His black long dress has been covered with dirt, seeing Klein inexplicably hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am seeing something that is not worth the money is damaged... He feels a heart in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Allen is still a little scared, Klein smiles and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time, Praying to the gods you believe in has a good effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Allen snorted, clocking four times on the chest, whispering Resentful, "The goddess of the night, which is more noble than the stars, and farther than the eternal, your devout believers pray for your care..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hes whispering, he Slowly eased down, no longer as fearful as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein hand-painted a triangular emblem on his chest, silently saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The god of steam and machinery, you are not a devout believer to pray for your care..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he couldn’t help but laugh at himself, doubt I may be killed by the Thunder on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, lightning and thunder are the Lord of the Storm, not in the realm of steam and machinery... Klein thought quite easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than 20 minutes, the two sat in the interrogation room of the nearby police station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When recording the confession, Klein calmly told the police that he was just a private investigator who was commissioned. It was not clear what happened, Dr. Allen detailed Describes your own dreams and the reasons for excavating the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein could tell that the police did not believe it at all, but after they went out for a circle, they immediately changed their attitude, saying that Dr. Allen and Moriarty The detective has no suspicion. He only needs to sign a word on the confession to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allen was quite surprised by this, but Klein was not surprised at all, which is obviously worthy of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of having his doctor go to the Star Church in advance to find a bishop are reflected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before leaving the police station, Klein did not accidentally see a more familiar figure, that is the night who entered his dream before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the captain’s night-timer still wearing a gray trench coat. At first glance, he is more antifreeze than Klein. His blue eyes are swept away, and there is no abnormality. I removed my gaze from Klein's face and pretended that she was just an ordinary senior inspector. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same pretending that he was just an ordinary private detective, Klein pushed his glasses, put on a half-high silk hat, and left the police station with Dr. Allen. carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After telling his own driver to go to Minsk Street, Allen turned to look at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Sherlock, do you think things will stop here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the body is really Will., you should not be affected again. It’s bothering.” Kleinton paused. “Allen, have you felt strange in this time? No matter what.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Allen thought about it and shook his head: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's worth it Congratulations!" Klein gave a sigh of relief and said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, it’s best to end the affairs of Will Anthony, even though Klein’s thousand on the fog The paper crane will not reveal anything, and the divination after the event is no problem, but after all, he still has some worries about which night whimsy to find some clues, and now, with Will Onsetin dying, the case Maybe it will soon go into a dead end, be put into the file, and it will be over for the time being. There will be no more attention if there is no new situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen relaxed and turned to wonder: "Frankly, I don't think my confession is too persuasive, why do the police finally choose to believe? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Klein deliberately pretended to be stupid. "I thought I had to let my lawyer come to take me home, no. I am on bail to go home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen squinted at the corner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sherlock, you seem to have a lot of experience in getting into the police station?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein laughed and replied deeply:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the fate of every private detective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein and Allen were brought into the police station near Green's cemetery, Folswall wore a black elegant dress, and the head was drooped down. The black bonnet of the mesh yarn went into the slightly quiet tomb. In the garden, I found the grave belonging to Mrs. Anlisa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She and Hugh had gone to Queens for an hour ago to find Viscount Glylint and got a reply that the other party was willing to borrow 400 pounds without any interest. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only requirement of Viscount Glylint is that two extraordinary people will accompany him to the party that Mr. A will gather tonight to protect his safety. The collection of "the venom crystallization of the crown jellyfish" to complete the modulation of the "pharmacist" potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——"The angle of the adult one-horned Pegasus" has been found by Audrey from the family treasure house, and made a name in the name of biological experiments. This effectively offset some of her debt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
