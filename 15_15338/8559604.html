Klein was a big man, but his face was quietly asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The fish with human fingers in the belly!" Unable to wait for German. Sparo to respond, Frank rushed out of the restaurant, and it didn't take long before he ran back and had more hands. Blue-black monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fish has a normal length, eyes are like a human eye, and the belly has been cut open, and you can see three bloody fingers inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not what I put, this is what it originally had! You look at its mouth, it will not eat this kind of thing, so only It can be grown by itself! Of course, I can't figure out what the long fingers are doing for it." Frank said very quickly about his judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at the fish and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may be someone else It’s stuffed in.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“...it makes sense, then it’s not the most unique fish.” Frank stunned for a second, vaguely disappointed, “ The finger is flesh and blood, I asked Heath, he is an expert in this area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been looking around and found a small circle Heath Doyle eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank quickly stepped over and put the blue-black fish in front of the "bloodless". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heath Doyle stretched out his hands and held the fish, and he put his face on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank looked at the picture, and it was a bit wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly reacted, haha ​​laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, this is not for you Food, you always eat fish during this time, and you have a smell on your body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean, do you know the fingers in the fish belly? Can you find out the original owner? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heath Doyle stopped his body and carefully examined the passage for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "They belong to a 'Royal Bishop', at least a 'Royal Bishop'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the three fingers out and bloodied them together.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the coagulation, the fingers melted like a candle and turned into a thick flesh.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flesh fluttering, depicting a bright red on the table Words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Bishop of Rose" fingers... "Help"... Seeing this scene, Klein standing next to him has an instant.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered the "Black Saint" Leo Master in the dream world!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "Aurora The saints of the meeting were in somewhere in the remains or ruins, influenced by the power of the "audience" approaching angels or the remnants of the gods, splitting a good personality and being trapped there.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His good and evil personality constantly confronts each other, and often engages in spiritual confrontation. The darker-looking master gradually gains the upper hand. Good personality can only hide in the spiritual world and seek help.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this is a try for a good personality of Leo Marst? As a saint of the "Aurora", he is likely to be a "shepherd" promotion, with "rose" The extraordinary ability of the bishop is not surprising... Klein has thought about his position and feels that his judgment should be close to the truth. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help? How to do it? Frank Lee looked a little blankly at the face of German Sparrow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should ask your captain, not me... Klein shakes Shake his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is too much weirdness in this sea area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis for his opinion is that from the previous dreams, Leo Master’s owner Have an absolute advantage, if you really want to save, you must be prepared to deal with a half-god. Although the good personality will certainly interfere, but at the very least, the strength of the "Black Saint" will be reduced to a certain extent. But this is still a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is a "mysterious queen" on the "Future". It’s really hard to try, but it’s not easy, but if it’s so easy to save, it’s easy. Leo Master can be completely regarded as a kind of "black saint". Klein believes that the queen must have done it long ago. The reason why she does not act is bound to have real obstacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the place where LeoMast is located, the power of the splitting of the human personality is not even challenged by the "mysterious queen"... Leo Masters Dream Only after a little reduction, I almost fell into a situation that was difficult to cope with. Finally, I took out the Poseidon scepter to solve the problem quickly. If the real world encounters it again, I will split the personality and become a member of the madhouse. I must think about it. The way to borrow the "heart candle" from Father Uttraski, there is hope for healing... Oh, I can also find Miss Justice, but her strength is definitely not enough... Klein recalled before, self Twisted two sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Frank Lee is very convinced of Gilman Sparo. "Maybe the help-seeking guy has already died..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, his eyes suddenly brightened, staring at Heath Doyle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"can eliminate Are these flesh and blood originally branded?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes." Heath Doyle responded succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank Lee’s mouth is a little bit open and laughs like a two-pound child:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I have always been curious about the flesh and blood composition of 'Rose Bishop'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Always thinking, using similar flesh and blood as a medium of hybridization, it will happen whats the matter. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, you are going to die in your experiment, okay, I will leave the ship soon... Klein has a species The feeling of the bear child entering the arsenal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head Doyle, who was pale to almost transparent, stunned for two seconds, and immediately said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean? Frank Lee scratched his head and looked blank.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably thank you for restraining your curiosity, not using his flesh and blood as a test, it is worth it. A trusted companion... Kline’s mouth tried to interpret it a little bit, and he became more and more convinced that the “Future” and the second deputy, the brain circuit was very strange.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; afternoon town, half-collapsed church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "The Demon Hunter" Colin stood next to the clergyman wearing a simple white robe and whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the kings? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does a huge disaster mean?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Who tempted Saslier? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clergyman did not seem to hear it, still squatting there, repeating his confession over and over again, like the illusory image left by the environment. The same.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resentment, ghost, or evil spirit? Dairik looked at the direction nervously.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The Demon Hunter" Colin saw the priesthood completely unresponsive, and stretched out his right hand, letting the silver straight sword coated with light gray grease one inch and one inch close to each other.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the sharp tip of the sword has reached the back of the head, the clergyman is still repenting, nothing has changed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin Iliad took back the silver straight sword, and the eyelids highlighted the dark green symbol.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he walked to the altar in front of the slant, and his eyes fell on the candle that was emitting dim light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds of silence, he extended his left palm and extinguished all the candles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue of the fallen altar in the center of the altar became bleak, and the white robe man who fell to the ground finally stopped repenting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly looked up, his face was green and his eyes filled with hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek and Heinm and others are still able to respond in the future, the devout priests have already rushed out, the speed is fast, almost dragged out Obvious afterimage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Demon Hunter" Colin seems to have already prepared, his right foot is stepping forward, the body is half-turned, and the silver straight sword in his hand whistling out to the rear. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the blade, a piece of light rises, and a huge storm instantly forms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This storm consisting entirely of light swept around, allowing the priest to be stiff in the air and immediately swallowed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm soon ended, and the "hunter" Colin looked at the priest who had been poured into the body by the morning light, repeating the problem just now. Once again: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the kings?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the huge disaster? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who tempted Saslier?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ecclesiastical figure is very vague Sorry and replied: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The kings have Saslier, Ulos, Medici..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was about to say the fourth name, and the body suddenly set off a transparent flame! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flame instantly swallowed him and burned it into a black gas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original "king" refers to the king of angels...who is the fourth name, why did he just destroy himself when he just said to export? Is it the one who tempted Saslier, or is it another? Dairik only felt that he was full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the demise of the priesthood, on the streets outside, throughout the afternoon, Huo Ran sang another sound that approximated the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick looked down at the window and saw a huge face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is placed in a place that is originally glass, with a unique single eye and a black short hair on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬! There is also a similar monster inside the church. It is a normal human, with two eyes, but the body is also covered with wild black short hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A completely degraded fallen town..." "The Demon Hunter" Colin sighed and greeted one of the monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick, Heimham, and Joshua also formed a battle formation, trying to block the remaining monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Future" calm sailing, once again ushered in a short time Dark night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Klein came to the world of dreams, he found himself returning to his previous position and returned to the "star above" will be next to Jia Delia. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is about to look at the "Giant Wang Ting" projection on the opposite mountain, looking for possible clues, and suddenly heard Jia Delia sullenly sitting on his knees. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you met her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein "Well", did not do hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gidardia licked his lower lip:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is on the boat?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Klein turned his head and looked at the "star above", casually saying, "You have deep feelings for her."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
