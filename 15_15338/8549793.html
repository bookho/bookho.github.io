			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard’s singer is like a sleeping song, scorning between the left and right doors, echoing in the winding wooden stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s spirit suddenly lingered, and seemed to see the quiet moonlight and saw the peaceful lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyelids quickly become heavier, as if standing and falling asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a perceptual ambiguity, he feels the invisible, inconspicuous, indifferent gaze from behind, as if he is in the spirit world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An inexplicable deja vu tastes, Klein Horan regains his thoughts, and relies on his own powerful inspiration and familiar meditation to barely get rid of that The influence of "Midnight Psalm". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is still physically and mentally quiet, and it is difficult to generate other emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Leonard stopped singing and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think How can I apply for a Feenetport and how can I sing without accompaniment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, joking, I heard that they are all asleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-haired, poetry temperament of the night squad members took the step and walked to the front door of the kidnappers and hostages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly swayed his shoulders, broke his fist and slammed into the door lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wood around the door lock is broken and the sound is very weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This requires precise control." Leonard turned back and laughed as he reached into the hole and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who has recovered to sober, is not as confident as he is, put his hand under his arm, pull out the pistol, and adjust the wheel to ensure that it can be fired immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the back of the door, he saw a man who was sleeping on the table, his pistol fell to his feet, and saw a confused move. Eyes, the man who wants to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard approached and stunned the robber who was about to wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is planning to follow, suddenly as if it has sensed something, violently turned over the body, facing the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒,哒,哒, footsteps from bottom to top, gradually clear, a man in a brown jacket, without a hat, holding a bag of bread , bypass the corner of the stairs and go to the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he paused and saw the shiny metal muzzle looking down on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His pupils showed a young man wearing a half-height silk hat, wearing a black formal suit and a bow tie of the same color, reflecting the other side The cane at the railing reflects the dangerous revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop all your movements, raise your hands, three or two..." Kline's tone was low and soothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds the revolver in both hands, trying to use the other as a target for practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a tight atmosphere, the man in a brown coat lost the bag of bread and slowly raised his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., have you misunderstood what?" He stared at Klein's finger on the trigger and squeezed a little smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is temporarily unable to judge whether he is a kidnapped companion or a neighbor next door, but the surface is not showing a little abnormality, said: "<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't try to struggle, wait for someone to identify if it is a misunderstanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, handle the kidnappers in the house De came out and glanced at the man at the corner of the stairs and said leisurely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is there a companion in the kidnapper who is responsible for receiving and purchasing food?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, the man in a brown coat swelled and suddenly started Feet, kicked the bag of bread that fell in front of him, trying to block Kline’s view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein seemed to be unaffected, just like practice, calmly pulling the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s left shoulder had a bloody flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went home and fled to the second floor, but Leonard reached out and supported the railing and jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A snoring sound, Leonard descended from the sky and landed on the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man was in a coma, Leonard patted some of the blood stained and looked up at Klein, hehe laughed:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The shooting method is not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to hit his leg... Klein’s mouth is invisibly twitching After a while, the nose smelled a touch of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that after taking the "Divination" potion, although his vision, hearing and touch were not improved, he could still "see" to be blocked. Things can still “listen” to see weak footsteps and make judgments in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a category of "inspiration"? Klein nodded thoughtfully, watching Leonard find a sharp dagger from the kidnapped companion and watching him "drag" the other into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a handgun, a cane, Klein stepped into the house where the kidnapper was, and saw Elliot Wickrol awakened by gunshots and his body curled up Become straight and sit up slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original three kidnappers were tied by Leonard’s ropes against Eliot, and they were strung together in a string and lost to the corner. Part, then tear their clothes instead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who was shot in the shoulder was comatose and was bandaged, but Leonard dismissed the dirty and did not help him remove the bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, are you?" Eliot saw the scene in front of him, with a pleasant surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you guessed it right, very accurate." Leonard, who was half-squatting, replied casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t think this guy is really a bit of a humorous cell... Klein drops the revolver and looks to Eliot:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"We are the mercenaries your father invited, you can also call our security personnel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call, really? I was saved. "Is Elliot full of joy and dare not ask indiscriminately." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that within a few hours from being kidnapped to the present, he has suffered a lot and has not had the urge to be old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard stood up and said to Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go looking for patrol below The police, let them inform the tobacco dealer, I don't want to take the kids and the four guys out like a kidnapper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking what to do Subsequent Klein nodded, took the revolver, carried the cane, and walked up the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first order went down, he vaguely felt that he had forgotten something, and heard Leonard say to Eliot:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to be nervous, you will soon see your father, mother and old housekeeper engraving, or will we come to the Kunte card?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein endured a smile and walked into the street, finding two patrolling police officers based on the directions of the passers-by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not use the "Special Action Department" badges and documents, but the name of the professional security personnel, the original story of the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the issue of armed, he is not worried at all, because he just got the "full-scale weapon use certificate" the day before yesterday - through the internal channel application, the approval will be very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two police officers glanced at each other, separated one person to inform the helper, informed the Wickrol family, and the remaining one followed Klein back to the kidnappers. s room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for more than forty minutes, the police did not notice the opportunity, Leonard made a color to Klein, let him slip out of the room with himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Trust me, it’s a waste of time to go to the police station. Let's leave first." The poet's temperamental night actor explained easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has a high-top mentality in the sky, no rebuttal, followed. After nearly five minutes, several fast-moving carriages rushed to the front of the building where the kidnappers were located. The old butler was accompanied by his fat owner Vic. Rolle went down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, he is still in a state of confusion, can't believe that the good news came so fast, it was like a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he heard a slamming sound and subconsciously turned his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two-wheeled carriage passed by, the window was open, and the dark-haired, green Leonard made another snap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing the wagon of the Vicker's house, Leonard closed the window, turned his body and looked at Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiles and raises his right hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy cooperation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We don’t seem to be familiar... Kline’s courtesy and the other side hit the palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not expect that the kidnapping case could be solved so quickly, but he could only secretly feel that the extraordinary person is really extraordinary, even if he is a semi-hanger sequence 9, he can do it. A lot of incredible things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the movement of the nobility to express their celebrations after fencing." Leonard explained with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Klein has many aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked out of the window and frowned slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't and Mr. Can you confirm it? If he thinks it is the police rescued Eliot, our reward will be less than half."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full 100 pounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the fall of the kidnappers, there is no doubt as to the "meeting". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't care, money is not that important to our lives." Leonard smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......For me, it is very important! Klein squeezed a polite smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many poets died prematurely because of poverty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that Eliot will not lie on this matter, I can see that he still has Innocent, but even if you get 200 pounds, you can't divide much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much can I divide?" Klein asked immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the ever-unwritten rules, the rewards must be paid half to Mrs. Oliana, as additional funds for the team, and the rest are equally divided by the participating players. Unfortunately, you are not a full member, you can only get 10%."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 pounds? It’s not bad... Klein pretended that he didn’t feel bad, and instead asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “You don’t worry about the kidnapper’s wake up, do you understand that you’ve been affected by extraordinary power? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They won't doubt, they just think that the weather is too good, too suitable for sleep, they can't help but fall, they even believe The chanting only exists in the dream, this is what we have verified.” Leonard replied with confidence, “It’s your hunting demon bullet, which makes people feel strange. Of course, a geek who likes occult is very Reasonable explanation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
