			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the misty morning, Klein sat at his own table and smashed the specially bought oat bread into the milk to improve his eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his body has changed, the pursuit and persistence of food is engraved in the soul, and it is completely unable to adapt to the monotonous and repeated breakfast style of the Lun Kingdom. Try to try as much as possible, not to mention toast, bread, bacon, sausage, butter and butter, and strive to expand the border and enrich the way of eating. For example, his recipe has added a popular pork pie in the south. Inner Porter, grilled corn crepes and other varieties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The caviar of the Fossac Empire is also good, it is too expensive, only suitable for formal meals..." Klein scooped up with a spoon A small piece of oatmeal bread, stuffed it into the mouth, and only chewed it, and felt the milk that was smeared with wheat scent, and the bread returned more sweetly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast, Klein put down the fork spoon, did not rush to clean up, picked up the newspapers that had just been sent, and read them leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait for a divination, if nothing happens, go to St. George Street, Saatchi Street, visit Mr. Reppard to see if his new type of transportation has investment. Value... Beckland is really big, every district is almost the same as Tingen, and the East is especially exaggerated, at least more than twice... The most convenient and cost-effective way to travel is to turn the steam to the subway and then double Feet, it is a bit of a waste of time... Klein is inextricably divergent thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Beckland’s public carriage system is similar to Tingen, and the pricing is similar. The only problem is that most of them are limited to individual A district, if you want to transfer from Jowood to St. George, you need to transfer several times, the price will naturally go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation makes the prospects of new vehicles very attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the huge knock on the door echoed and plunged into Klein’s ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who... don’t know how to pull the doorbell... He muttered two sentences, took care of the neckline, came to the door and stretched out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who appeared in front of him was an acquaintance. The man who had chased Little Ian on the steam subway before, the skin was black, the eye sockets were deep, and the skin was deep and thin. The plateau man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the results of Klein’s “Psychic”, he is called Mersoe, the “sentence person” of the Zmanger party, and the leader of the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me, which one are you looking for? Is there something you want to entrust me?" Klein deliberately showed some confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merso is wearing a black jacket and a flamboyant silk topper, but not like a gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Klein indifferently and asked in the Lun language with a strong plateau accent:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Sherlock. Moriarty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Klein replied succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merceo’s hard-nosed nod:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I want to entrust you to find someone.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happens when you come in." Klein didn't let himself show the slightest exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merso shook his head coldly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, his eyes suddenly became sharp:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person I was looking for was called Ian. Ian Wright, who has bright red eyes, about fifteen or six years old, likes to wear brown, old coats, wearing the same colored dome hats, I think you should know him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein laughed a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mersault does not seem to hear the other party's denial: "He is a thief who stole a very important item from me. If you can find him, you can get at least 10 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are too few clues you have provided." Klein freely found an excuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"30 pounds." Mersor gives a new offer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at him with a glance:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, this is my secret principle. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"50 pounds." Mersor responded coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I'm sorry, I won't pick up this task." Klein stunned for two seconds and eventually chose to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merso slowly looked at him slowly for a few seconds, his eyes gradually becoming cold and fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not give a new offer, and did not politely leave, violently turned around and hurried to the end of the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gang’s intelligence ability is very good... I know Ian has come to me... Klein secretly sighed two sentences and did not Too many fears and fears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a person who has faced the evil spirits, after all, although the belly is separated... Thinking about it, his smile suddenly splendid, and starting to flip the coin decides whether today Go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is yes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. George District, Saatchi Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The railroad public carriage turned to the steam subway to the trackless public carriage, Klein finally arrived at the destination, spending a total of 11 pence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just walked out of the carriage and found that there was a pattering rain outside, and he did not bring an umbrella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to newspapers and magazines, this is the daily life of Beckland. The reason why hats are popular is because ladies and gentlemen don't carry umbrellas at any time... Klein pressed his half-height silk hat and ran to the outside of House 9 in a small step, blocking the rain with the eaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He patted the apparent drops of water and rang the doorbell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not hear the sound of Cuckoo Valley, and he did not notice the movement of Dangdang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The doorbell is broken?" Kline was about to raise his hand and knock at the door, suddenly finding footsteps far and near. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a natural appearance in his mind, a tall, thin, brunette, blue-eyed, thirty-year-old, wearing a gray-blue Worker's clothing, but it looks gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the door opens, the gentleman squats down the forehead:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please ask Who are you looking for? What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took off the top hat and bent slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I came to Mr. Reppard, I am interested in his new type of transportation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman’s eyes are bright:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Reppard, please come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned over and let Klein enter However, there is no coat rack in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein can only rely on the cane and follow Leipard to the living room without leaving his jacket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that this gentleman’s home is very messy, and there are many mechanical related items such as wrenches, bearings and screwdrivers on the coffee table in the living room. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gentleman is a bit straightforward. He doesn't seem to be good at interpersonal relationships... Klein's thoughts flashed and changed the scheduled rhetoric. He replied bluntly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I have to see your new means of transportation before you can make a decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't give a promise without knowing anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he looked around and saw the triangular emblem hanging from the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a symbol of the god of steam and machinery. The solid triangle is filled with symbols such as steam, gears and levers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reppard did not object to Klein’s way of going straight to the subject, immediately said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will show you to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, he slammed his head: "Almost forgot, we must first sign a confidential contract to ensure You don't steal my invention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Repard, your memory is not very good... Klein smiled and said:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Signing a simple contract, Repard led Klein into the suspected living room The room, he opened the room and the basement next door, and became a lot wider and more empty. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many parts on the ground, and the rough things of a half-man-high car-like carriage stand in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the doorbell line is also connected here, and is cleverly arranged, as long as someone pulls the rope, the mechanism will pop a steel ball to make it Rolling along a special track, hitting things in the center, produces a reverberation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is certainly not too big, but enough to awaken Reppard who is addicted to mechanics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the new vehicle you invented?" Kline pointed to the rough path in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I invented according to the imagination of Russell the Great!" Reppard replied wildly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The imagination of Russell the Great?" Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reppard explained in a adoring tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Russell the Great left A manuscript, which depicts his imagination of various mechanical devices in the future, he is a brilliant genius, no, master! Many things have become reality! Oh, this manuscript is preserved in the steam and mechanical church. It’s not a devout believer, there is no way to borrow it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Great Emperor, you still don’t leave a way for others... Klein’s mouth is moving, almost impossible to keep Smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Detailed introduction." He shifted the topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repard led Klein to the rough metal thing and brushed the doorway:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a vehicle that does not require a horse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The driver sits on the left front, constantly pedaling, connected by levers, chains, etc. Four wheels, let them roll forward, and on the wheels, I used a rubber inflation method, which will make the ride smooth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, That is the human car? Klein couldn't help but vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said at his discretion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This huge car, at least four passengers, I am afraid that I can't travel far."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my next goal, to reduce weight and enlarge the leverage multiple! But my financial situation has been Not too optimistic, unable to support more attempts." Repard hoped to see Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
