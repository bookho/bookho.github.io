			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chic? Was the "original witch" a male before? Klein almost raised his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once had a speculation that the existence of the "original witch" evil spirits led to the "Assassin" approach starting from sequence 7, which would mutate into women and fix Down, who knows Russell's diary shows that the "original witch" may also be male at first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can explain two problems. First, the "original witch" is not a natural god. It depends on the potion to reach the position of sequence 0. The second is this way. Pure negative changes are implied in extraordinary characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russell once speculated that the truth of the law of conservation of extraordinary characteristics, suspected that all extraordinary characteristics are derived from the original creator, so will not increase The total amount is fixed... The assumption is true. Does this mean that the master who created everything is all-inclusive, negative, positive, neutral, and that the “witch” approach is purely negative? Of course, the ancient book may indeed be fake... Today's Russell Diary has a lot of information... The thoughts flashed, and Klein let the diary disappear into his own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can start." He smiled and said "justice" and "the sun". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"""""""" The Werewolf's extraordinary character was sold out, and a craftsman paid 1200 pounds to take it away. According to the agreement, I will get 200 pounds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found a clue to the deep sea Naga hair, a 100 pound, and you have a total of 5, if you have no doubt about this transaction, then I will complete it as soon as possible. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has a higher proportion of promises on the extraordinary characteristics of "Werewolf" because he knows the energy of "downside down" And the risk of taking it is better than the vampire Emlin White.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, he thinks a little about the operation of the "world" response:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, give me 5 deep sea Naga hair and 500 pounds of cash as soon as possible. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, only the characteristics of the human shadow are left, and my golden pound has also increased to 1,235 pounds. The two are not matched enough. If you want to wait for the "Mechanical Heart" to explore the Mausoleum of the Amun family, then I have to look at another 500 to 1000 pounds to buy it directly when I meet it... Klein subconsciously thinks about what else he has or Knowledge can be exchanged for money.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the premise is that the object of the transaction is capable of paying.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing here, "Justice" Audrey lifted his hand very little, and said nothing: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking for three materials, A pair of mirror dragon's eyes, its blood 50 ml, and the fruit of the tree of the elderly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Justice" got the formula of "psychologist" potion... Klein made a judgment instantly, and "upside down" also got A similar conclusion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I will write to my teacher and hope that he has one of these materials. Foer thought for a moment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik followed and nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will also pay attention to it. It is not uncommon for the Mirrored Dragon to be eroded. The tree of the elders is also, the amount, in the Silver City, and the extraordinary characteristics left by the 'spiritual analyst', but it is difficult to trade and easy. being doubted. ""Psychoanalyst" is the ancient name of "psychologist".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their communication Into Klein's ear, he immediately manipulated the "world" and let the dummies sullenly and hoarsely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will ask one in my circle Q, yes, continue to help me find the characteristics of the human skin shadow. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. "Justice" Audrey turned her head confidently and looked at the opposite side. "I'm going to pay attention to the ‘winding man' potion formula that you need. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic" Firth repeats: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will write to ask my teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this development, Klein is very pleased. After a long period of hard work, Tarot will finally open up two major channels of the "Psychological Alchemy" and the Abraham family, many things will become simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"World" laughs aloud:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your answer makes me hopeful, But you should also pay attention to protecting yourself in a way that is as unthinkable as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. World, you rarely say so much." Audrey smiled back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... A little smug, I didn’t pay attention to the original “world” people... Klein immediately made up for it, let the “world” smile and laugh: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have become valuable enough, I hope that similar transactions can last for a long time, so I will remind you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Audrey elegantly greeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "Sun" Dairik hesitated: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will also Try it, I have completed several patrols recently, without any exceptions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very good... Klein secretly said, "World" closed mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief silence, Alger looked thoughtfully at Miss Justice:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to know the details of the assassination of the Duke of Nigan, what do you need to pay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are you asking me? As a person close to the Storm Church, shouldn't you have fully understood the specifics of this case? Audrey was a glimpse, and immediately wanted to understand the intention of Mr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to ask the organization or power that drives the "desire apostle", but it is not good to ask Mr. "fool" directly, think this is too awkward, have questions The meaning, so, around a circle, by asking me to open the topic, gently shift the focus to the things I want to know... He knows that I am a noble lady, should pay attention to the assassination of the Duke of Nigan, not to me I will answer... "The man hanging up" is really experienced... "Justice" Audrey micro-hooking corner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no need to pay, each other Is it not the purpose of our Tarot Club to exchange free exchange of common sense information in their respective regions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way is that our Tarot will grow and develop! She is very conscious of her master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your words make me ashamed." "Inverted" Alger stunned for two seconds, pressing his chest and leaning his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The "fool" Klein, covered in thick fog, laughed a few times in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey licks his lips and considers the language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Desire' Apostle With the help of special scenes, he completed the assassination of the Duke of Nigan with his ability to detonate intense emotions and desires, and succeeded in breaking through the sewers at the expense of serious injuries.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Wait until the 'night of the night' catch up with him, he is already dead, there is the Grand Theft Auto 'Black Emperor', this gentleman is not going to destroy the mouth, his goal is to entrust the organization of 'Desire Apostle'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organization? Just when the "downside down" doubts, the "fool" of the bronze long table, Klein silently praised Miss "Justice" One sentence, looking at the other side, looks like a casual reminder: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the outside world, don't mention the name of the organization, don't write it down. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? "Audrey is quite stunned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
