In the heart of Klein, he quickly asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He already has Be prepared for the “consultation fee”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon sat there, with no extra movements, just like a talking doll:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" In a gathering attended by Maric, someone once discovered the tomb of an ancient aristocrat. They explored the periphery and did not dare to go deep, but there were traces of human shadows.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They hope to recruit a team that is strong enough to fully explore the tomb and share the valuable items. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking for help in a meeting of extraordinary people who are not familiar with each other, what do the two sides take to ensure that the other party is trustworthy? In case there is no mausoleum at all, it is only a preset. The trap? Klein's thoughts flashed, and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do they have success? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "Sharon's words are succinctly answered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... Klein didn't go to the details for a while, pressing the voice to avoid being heard by the coachman:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then, they never appeared again. Sharon calmly described, "One of the members is a friend of Maric, and he has completely disappeared in this matter." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for Klein to ask again, she continues to use the illusory whispering voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maric found some of his friends' belongings. I used divination to track to the town of Baiya. I found a hidden mausoleum entrance at the corner of the Stefford River. Maric's friends were inside but dead. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you in?" Klein asked, blurting out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it was determined by another method." Sharon explained, "The mausoleum made me feel dangerous. I didn't try to explore." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, she looks straight into Klein with a blue eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't have the extraordinary person of sequence 4 or the corresponding level of seals as a helper, it is best not to go deep into the tomb. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even you feel very dangerous, I don't need to go to the divination on the fog, I can know how terrible... Klein squints and looks at it." The floor of the carriage, thought for a few seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know which ancient aristocratic tomb? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon replied without a pause:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His last name is:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amon? The boarding house is part of the family of the family where Amon is located in the small "sun" and almost sneaked into the mysterious space above the fog. Klein used the power of the "clown" to control the micro-jump of the eyelids. He asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"OK?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, a figure has emerged in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black classical robes, wigs of the same color, wide forehead, thin face, Black eyes, black hair, a monocle made of crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon’s pale blond hair shines through the mist of the window, like a painting by a master, she said plainly:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the items first harvested, a member of the party who is good at ancient history judges that the owner of the mausoleum belongs to the Quaternary Tudor Dynasty, and the family name is Amon. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the special and powerful performance of the Amon in the Silver City, the situation of this family may be analogous to the Charato, and it is secretly passed down. There are high sequences, even the strongest of the angels. Keep some vital secrets, such as the "coordinates" of "the land of God's abandonment"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remains of such a family are dangerous. Knowing that maybe Amon will use some changes to cast his eye from the distant "land of God"... Can't use the situation of low- and medium-sequencers to speculate on the terrible half-god...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein didn’t think for a long time, he denied the possibility of exploring the Mausoleum of the Amon family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up slightly at Sharon with disappointment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only there was a shadow "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?" Klein’s eyes lit up and he gestured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon’s voice has not changed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In a party I attended, there was extraordinary The promise is that as long as someone can complete her assigned task, she will meet any reasonable request from the other party. The material limitation is 'high sequence below'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "That is, she can give any of the extraordinary materials below the high sequence?" The first thought that emerged in Klein's mind was: bragging? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the Church of the Night God, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the quiet church, has this possibility! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many of these materials don't need to be kept, because they don't work at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Klein’s doubts, Sharon calmly responded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“She is a High sequence strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High sequence strong? No wonder... This is the top level of the secret organizations of the major churches. Even if they don’t belong to them, they will build up their own power! However, the promise of any of the extraordinary materials below the high sequence is sure to have moisture... Klein has a lot of thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon added a sentence in a concise manner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She said that certain materials need to be certain The cycle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is right! Klein asked with interest: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What mission did she give?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Sharon has been sitting in a dignified and straightforward manner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Investigating the true identity of the Grand Theft Auto"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein believes that if he is drinking water at this moment, he must have been unable to control the opposite side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who I recruited, who was targeted by a high-ranking strongman? He first shouted in his heart in Chinese, and then quickly analyzed the possible objects: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Twilight Hermitage? Because the Grand Theft Auto "Black Emperor" killed the "desire apostle" Beria? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member of the Aurora? They associated with the "fool" from the tarot cards left by the Kaping incident, and decided to investigate the "Black Emperor" of the Grand Theft Auto? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the three churches and the MI9? Simply to figure out the truth about the Kapyeong incident? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is possible, and each cannot be ruled out! Klein did not show any abnormality, and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did she investigate the true identity of Grand Theft Auto's "Black Emperor"?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought for two seconds and organized the language: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of person is she? I want to know if this task should be taken."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon is silent for two seconds, seems to be remembering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she described:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Female, 1 meter or more, good body proportion Long-haired maroon, camouflage, black leather boots, only occasionally attending parties, first appeared more than two months ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love wearing black leather Boots, women, high sequence strong... These three keywords are linked together and suddenly reminded Klein of a certain memory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he went to the Kingdom Museum to steal the "Black Emperor" card, he encountered a mysterious and strange high-ranking strongman in the restored Russell’s study. The other party only reveals the feet wearing black leather boots, waiting for him to escape with the help of the force above the fog, and because of the side effects of the "master key" directly hit the devil dog, had to scream for help, so Sherlock. Mo Riatti’s identity once again saw the female demigod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She? How could she find the Grand Theft Auto "Black Emperor"? She confirmed that the thief who stole the "Big Card" was a spirit, and knew how the spirit would carry and accommodate the "Black Emperor" card, so it locked the "Black Emperor" of the Grand Theft Auto? Klein quickly thought of a very convincing possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that puzzles him is how the other party knows that he is taking the "Black Emperor" card instead of other cards, such as "Abyss" , "Sun" card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless she is directed at the "Big Card", she has already investigated in advance that it is the "Black Emperor" card... Well, Miss Sharon said She only attended the party for the first time more than two months ago. This is in line with the characteristics of the Russell exhibition... After occasionally participating, not leaving Beckland, or returning regularly, is to find the "Black Emperor" card. The enemy... Klein thoughts, and smiled slightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will help her pay attention, hope to have something to gain."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This life will not be rewarded! He did not hesitate to add a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon almost barely noticed the position and did not say anything about "human shadow". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, she only has two clues, but it is also better than the vampire Emlin White and the Eye of Wisdom Eisinger Stanton More powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slowly vomited and covered his disappointment, caring for a cold gesture:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You and Maric are not bothered by the curse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only one in the Dark Red Moon." Sharon calmly responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——People who wear “Crimson Moonlight” can exempt the influence of the full moon, which is what the “heterogeneous” dream of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, one is fine, one is as usual... When it is affected by the full moon, Maric will be almost crazy, Miss Sharon is losing power, it seems to be Mali. Odd to use... Klein thoughtfully shifted the topic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have found the spirit of the runaways in the extraordinary features of Steve's legacy Is there a way to pollute?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked casually, and did not hold much hope. He thought that it was more confident that the "Sun" classmates were there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Sharon is like talking about other people's things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I will sell this method to you in the future, I hope that you have already picked up the golden pound... Klein "hmm", suddenly did not know what to talk about It's a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused for a few seconds before asking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is Baiya Town?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
