			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein reached out and just caught the slightly heavy letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge white bone messenger did not stop, directly collapsed into a fountain, and one root fell into the deck, disappearing, and did not seem to want to stay here for another second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein holding the letter did not look down directly, following the spiritual instinct, the instinct turned and looked at the wooden steps leading to the first class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that Donna and Denton’s sisters had round eyes and half a mouth. It seemed that they wanted to scream because of the scene, but they had not had time to send out. The sound, I saw the end of the matter, so I suspected that there was an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children who have eaten the special bacon in Damir Port have a certain, short-sighted ability... Klein frowned, like when hunting fish. Raise your left hand, erect your index finger, and reach the mouth, let the two underage guys ban. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall figure of Donna immediately raised her hand, covered her mouth, and was afraid to nod and nodded, indicating that she knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked down and found that her brother was still a dull, busy pulling his arm and licking his palm to his mouth. side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crevis and Cecil noticed that they were not right, stopped and looked at Klein, but found nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of their gaze, Klein was dull and continued to move to his own room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gold coin does not know when it appears in his hands, flying up and down, swimming around, seems to have life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold coin bounces and falls, the number is up, indicating no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the previous episode will not harm Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, now this messenger is not polite at all, unlike before, it will pat the shoulders, push down the body, give advance reminders, or directly surround the spirits Demarcation, to prevent being seen by ordinary people... Klein whispered, took out the key and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat on the edge of the low bed, lit up half of the candle, and opened Mr. Azick’s reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extracting the contents, the first thing that caught his eye was the "Black Emperor" card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the unpleasant face, Klein instinctively let out a sigh of relief and put aside his concerns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not afraid that Mr. Azke will not return himself, this trust is still there, after all, the potion formula and the corresponding ceremony can be transcribed, only with high-order The properties of the material's polymerization effect cannot be imitated, and this is obviously not the way Azke is, nor the one that can be replaced. There is no demand for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is worried that the messenger has been robbed and lost the card that is very helpful to his spiritual state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not impossible, the strange creatures in the spiritual world are hard to count, and a few guys who love robbery messengers and are good at positioning are not too difficult to understand. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Black Emperor" card was returned with the bronze whistle from the members of the Spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take these two items temporarily, Klein unfolds a very textured letter, and reads Azick’s reply:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The card depicting the 'Black Emperor' reminds me of some pictures, a bloody emperor with a tall mountain and a bright red cloak. His eyes are very crazy, almost irrational. On the verge of out of control, there is a real black emperor who comes back from the resurrection. He sits on a huge throne and looks down on everything on the earth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I look up to them I was glanced at by the blood emperor and lost consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should have participated in the "four kings battle" to some extent, but the specific details need to be recalled, perhaps the trauma of that encounter. Let me lose my memory again and again, keep dying, and wake up again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have much touch on the legend of the dead sea of ​​the raging sea. Maybe when I take the boat to the Southland, I will have a certain sense when I pass the ocean, and I will be attracted by nature.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The experience of the copper whistle master is very similar to the 'undead' ritual, but there are obvious differences, I feel the evil atmosphere and the danger signs, I believe the owner of the copper whistle is In a strange and terrible state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You better not blow the copper whistle and drive the messenger. This will bring great danger. When I completely recover my memory, I can figure out that. What the experience represents, try again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The feathers left by the copper whistle master you mentioned can be used in the field of the dead, unique and spiritual. Material, when I think back more, I will sort out some rituals and spells that will let you use it. When it comes to this matter, I think of you asking about the past, except for the mental pollution in the characteristics, which probably needs to wait. For a while, at least so far, I am in a blank state in this regard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, I vaguely remember that in the South China, there was a strange creature called Yu.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The card is best to make a certain seal, otherwise it may attract you powerful enemies and numerous disasters. I can give you some tips. This is not too difficult. The first kind, the improved spiritual wall ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the card after the opening has a convergence effect... Fortunately, I was thrown over the fog before... According to Mr. Azick According to the content of the description, he should not be the god of death of amnesia, otherwise he would not look up to the blood emperor and the black emperor... He is the son of death, following the god to participate in the "four kings battle", unfortunately seriously wounded, should That's it... Klein thought about it, licking a flame and burning the letter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he tried the next seal technique and became skilled in Azick. The knowledge taught in the letter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he held a ceremony to put the "Black Emperor The bronze whistle of the card and the spiritual group brought the mysterious space above the fog to prevent any possibility of accident.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, Klein is unwilling Suddenly encounters the "King of the Five Seas" in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the early morning, the sun jumped out of the sea level and dyed a golden color in the distance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein ate two pieces in the second-class cafeteria, which is not rich in food. The toast with bacon and butter, drunk a cup of lemon black tea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fill your stomach, he came to the deck, breathe fresh air, and enjoy the early view At this time, he saw Captain Allan coming back drunk, wearing a straight sword swaying.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of what happened last night, Klein greeted the past and said with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White shark didn't bother you?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He should find out that I am white Passengers on the agate. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan, wearing a dark red coat, took off the bonnet cap on his head and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is his own problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, he has a bar repair fee that allows you to pay half of the compensation, but this is not much, just a few sores, just as I won 6 pounds last night. I have given some tips, and things are over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, you are afraid that my crazy adventurer will make things big, so things are big, so Directly bear it yourself? Klein was silent for a few seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he turned Go through the body and go back to the bow, leaving a very light words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp [&nbsp; Back to the previous position, Klein felt the sea breeze blowing, slowly vomiting, only to feel that it is difficult to set up a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blowing the wind, he was about to return to the cabin, and suddenly there were two more figures beside him, it was Donna and Denton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cesil, who is responsible for protecting them, is swimming a few steps away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donna obviously didn’t sleep well last night, her eyes were a little swollen, her face was quite bleak, but her spirit was quite exciting, she knew that Klein was watching the scenery, but her eyes were flexible. The ground is turning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Denton wants to speak with her, she preemptively:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle, last night, last night, who is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of speaking, she looked straight ahead, never looked sideways, but her body was slightly The shudder seems to recall the picture I saw at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a messenger, you can understand it as a postman." Klein also didn't look at the two little guys, as if to say what was eaten for breakfast today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The messenger?" Danton almost couldn’t control the volume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The world is so big, there will always be some strange creatures, believe me, although it looks very fierce and terrifying, but it is very gentle and very professional... It just sent me a letter for a friend from afar.” Klein explained slightly, trying to describe the white bone messenger nearly four meters tall, poor, weak and helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A night of panic, because there was no harm to himself, Donna was calmer and her eyes unconsciously brightened:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, amazing!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just like listening to stories! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cool! "Denton also expressed his opinion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he asked inexplicably: "Why can't others see it?" They are not responding! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is because your soul is pure." "Klein's micro-hooking corner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a good faith lie, after all, can't directly say that it is a special bacon problem, it will make two curious little The guy can't help but try.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, not mentioning a lot of intake will cause illness, it is a very dangerous thing to just open the mind. - Even if Klein can support the consumption of the vision for a long time, he will not always be open. Sometimes, seeing things that should not be seen will be frantic or even dead!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, can we also have our own messengers? "Donna asked curiously and excitedly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It depends on luck. Klein replied calmly and calmly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but vomit one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I don't have my own messenger yet!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get a messenger, you must first design an accurate summoning ceremony, and prepare the corresponding spiritual creature contract, which belongs to The knowledge of the field, it is very easy to summon bad things, so Klein can't be recklessly trying before he is sure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm. "Donna is quite looking forward to it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, her little voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle, We will keep it secret for you! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denton next to her focuses on the head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, one in Damme The new passengers on board the ship took the baggage and walked onto the deck.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The flame" Daniz took the telegram, considering that the captain might have to order something, Decided to break the holiday and head to the capital of the Rhodes Islands.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got a ticket through his own channel, wearing a wig, blackened his eyebrows, very It was easy to get on the White Onyx, waiting for the passenger ship to whistle out of Hong Kong.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哎, as Russell’s said, there are capable people, It’s always a little tired... Daniz walked into the cabin and looked around leisurely. Suddenly, he saw a familiar figure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
