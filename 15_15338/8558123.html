			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s said that Elaine’s eyelids turned slightly and seemed to be in a memory:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I first resold the steel and coal shipped from the west coast of the sea to Fenetport, and brought the tobacco, coffee, cocoa and other specialties back to Intis. This is a coastal route, relatively safe and competitive. Very intense, in order to get rid of the difficulties as soon as possible, while trying to raise the capital, I tried to improve the sequence, hoping to do colonial trade.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, I just got familiar with the fairway and earned For the second time, on the way to West Bailang, I met the 'sick girl' at the time instead of the 'disease lieutenant' Trey robbed. She had only one boat at the time, but she was very strong, I and My partner is desperate to resist and cannot recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She didn't have the habit of indiscriminate killing, just robbed the goods, and, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;It’s an alternative to the witch... Klein listened quietly, using the clown’s ability to suppress the embarrassing emotions, and asked with a blank expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Which step did you develop?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Yilian could have denied that "all she forced me! I, I don't want to die, I can only choose to bear, and, moreover, she is a woman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms., the reaction is not so intense, if I ask if you have already had a super Friendship relationship, you still can't jump from here? That is to say, this person is still kind, considering your shame, it is not so direct... Hey, the crazy Gelman Sparo under the mask is a gentleman of me... This is the most authentic me... Ryan’s expression changed and he asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What kind of cuisine do you prefer? Are there any special dishes? Sweet, salty, or in the middle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What food do you hate? What are you allergic to? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have a mouthful? If so, what?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one question is heard that Elaine is dreaming, not real enough.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never thought about it The other person will ask a similar question, just like a suitor asks what the favorite object has.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no pursuer will ask this! Indirectly brought out in a chat, or inquired from another channel! No woman will like others to ask this question! This is more like a survey invented by Russell the Great... He, what do he want to do? He I asked these questions without any expression. I was so scared... Elaine silently answered them one by one in Klein’s cold eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Klein kept his forward leaning position and continued to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you usually sit? What are the habitual actions..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the answer is, the more panic and uneasy it is, the inexplicable feeling that it will disappear.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this incomprehensible and frightening "questionnaire" is done, her heart becomes heavy and she always suspects that she will have a bad end.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to fight, don’t he pay attention to jumping off the carriage? Elaine seriously considers this possibility.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp However, the other party has no signs of hands-on, and she is always determined to think that things have a peaceful solution.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mastering Elaine’s character, habits and After the hobby, Klein returned the topic to the "sickness of the disease": <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you know about Trey? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilan was silent, his mouth was agitated several times, and he could not speak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carriage For a while, she finally smiled bitterly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She has excellent fighting ability, good at stealth and curse, can be invisible and light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She mastered the mirror and wand for the body, mastered the black flame and frost, and allowed a range of enemies to suddenly become sick, including colds, pneumonia, gastroenteritis Wait, the longer you fight with her, the more serious the disease is, and some extraordinary people even die directly from heart disease.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She also can also make invisible silk threads to control the enemy. She has a deep understanding of the human body and the human body, and it is very easy to make people happy through contact, then, that aspect of happiness.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She has the initiative to charm, many pirates even give up resistance in order to approach her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is usually friendly, but she is cruel to the enemy, likes to destroy the beauty that the other person wants to protect, and let them suffer in the extreme pain of the spirit. Pant..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilan didn’t specifically say how Trey was destroying others’ good, there are many cruel stories and funny accidents. The "sick girl" once killed the enemy father and son, and also caused a wife of an enemy to betray him and let him directly hit the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough to be a witch, a higher level of "happy" than the "happiness" 5 "painful witch"... Klein roughly grasped the fighting style of Trey Calm again without asking: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do she have magical items?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... ... Yes, a diamond-encrusted bracelet, as long as it is worn, Trey is hard to be hurt." Elaine hesitated to tell the secret of "the disease lieutenant". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein asked a few more in detail, the forward leaning body straightened a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Trea is helping the witch sect to sell the population?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what he always cares about when he heard about the “Iceberg Lieutenant” Edwina. problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witch sect cooperates with Ins. Zangweier, has a connection with the royal family, and involves an underground ruins where I don’t know where to go;<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tre is helping them sell their population;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being "downside down" means that the director has repeatedly lost slaves And the balun of the primitive tribes of the Southland appeared in the upper layer of the underground relics;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary keeper of Beckland’s largest trafficker, Kapyeong, belongs to "Arbiter" approach, and this is controlled by the Lun royal family, the Fenetport royal family and the military of the two countries...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things that Klein has mastered It became a line, but what was revealed specifically, he did not know, "Terrorist Lieutenant" Trey is a breakthrough <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What witch denomination?" Yilian confused and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to know." Klein responded calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you understand what a witch is, the fascinating "sickness squad" who is suspicious of being happy is once a dirty and savage man, I I am afraid that you will get out of control on the spot... No thanks, I am a good person... Klein spit in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilan suppressed the doubts and recalled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She did help with shipping in the last year A few ship slaves, the other side of the deal is 'Crazy Captain' Connor Victor, who is said to have in-depth cooperation with many traffickers and slave traders in Lun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Crazy Captain" Connors Victor... Klein remembered the nickname and name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, his voice was no longer so low, but he asked quite softly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you been involved in similar things? Have you worked as a pirate part-time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This very polite and friendly tone made the ridiculous driving of Daniz inexplicable. Only the similar state of the German Sparrow is more terrible than the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Elaine shook his head. "I am streaming the blood of the Sauron family. I will not let the family be ashamed, and, moreover, Trey Always say, it won't make me bloody, see the darkness, all this is faced by her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her romance novels are much more... Ryan pulled out a gold coin and let it roll between the fingers, like dancing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not avoid Elaine, and made a divination in front of her face to confirm whether she lied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is that the other party is still honest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also because I did not specifically ask her and Teresa to have emotional entanglements, otherwise she could not be so confessed... Klein secretly sighed and put away the gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the carriage was also wounded to the port, but it was no longer the location of the ship that Elian had booked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked out the view of the window, took out a metal vial and handed it to Elaine:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Remove the makeup on your face with the liquid inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Elaine asked subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not the question you should ask." Klein leaned forward again and said with a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilian has some grievances and anger, but does not want to intensify the contradiction with the other party at this critical moment, can only unscrew the bottle cap, smell the smell, try Have tried the toxicity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Direct use?" she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein simply "hmm". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilan took out a white handkerchief, poured the liquid in the metal vial onto it, then wiped the face and quickly removed the previous camouflage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neutral beauty disappeared, the lines of the face became soft, and the original look of Elaine was presented in Kline’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a careful look, Klein whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remove the hat and let go Hair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilan brows humble, always feel that there will be orders that he can't accept, such as taking off his clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a deep breath, took off the top hat, and released the red that was lit up, and it looked very feminine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein straightened his body and leaned back against the wall, whispering in his voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You can do the disguise just now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a madman? Tossing for so long, back to the beginning? Yilian dared not to speak, worried that the other party made a bad request, quickly opened the suitcase, took out the mirror, and took photos of himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unloading so clean... She snorted and then quickly made a make-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the carriage stopped, she had changed back to a handsome young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded invisibly, looked around his eyes and slowly recovered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The last question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Elaine asked nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein lifted his eye and his face muscles moved:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your chest How big is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Elaine was a glimpse first, then his face turned red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a shy red, but the kind of red that wants to punch the other's chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s eyes did not dodge, calmly added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is an academic issue.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Seeing that there is no color in the other's eyes, Elaine took a breath and closed his eyes to answer the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quietly sighed and took out a ticket and a stack of paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A new proof of identity, go to the port of Port of Thiana.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where I got there, I bought the port of Pritz. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
