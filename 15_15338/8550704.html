There are big differences between foreign traditional costumes such as the Republic of Tis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment around him is dim, the tables and chairs are outdated, and the light is illuminated from time to time, but Klein can't hear the thunder and the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the picture, the teenager clasped his hands against his forehead, the front bow of the body, constantly praying for something, the thick voice lingering over Klein Ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein focused on listening, but found a fact that made him jealous:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t listen Know what the other person is saying, it is a language he has never touched! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......As the mysterious ruler above the fog, I didn’t even know the “foreign language”... Klein laughed at himself and was not willing to distinguish it carefully. When you first test English listening, you should be serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So listening and listening, he gradually noticed a problem:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other party’s language is not It belongs to any one you have learned, but it is very close to the ancient Saskatchewan. There are similar signs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father...mother... these two words should mean this? It’s very similar to Guvsak, but it’s different..." Klein frowned and fell into thinking. "Guuffsic is the lingua franca of the Quaternary, the source of all contemporary languages, and it is gradually changing itself... I can't decide now... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listened and listened, and excluded contemporary languages ​​such as Lun, Fossac and Intis from grammatical construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a variant of Guvsak in the long history? Just like the words written on the notes of the Antignus family?" Klein The fingers even knocked on the edge of the bronze long table, and the invisible slogan was slightly invisible. "There is another possibility. Gussack is not born out of thin air. It is derived from the giant language... The Fossac Empire in the north has always claimed to be its own national. There is a giant blood...this may be the giant language of the old age..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Klein, who had insufficient knowledge reserves, had to suspend and take spirituality back. No longer watching, no longer listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not intend to immediately pull the praying teenager into the fog, ready to understand what the other party is saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, before this, we will often observe and do basic "assessment". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein breathed a sigh of relief and leaned back in the magnificent temple of the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrapped himself in spirit, simulating the feeling of falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Review" finished Russell's diary, Klein changed dress Go out to the Divination Club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doubled his salary and chose to take a public carriage, but took care of Mrs. Wendy’s business extravagantly and spent 1.5 pence to buy a sweet iced tea. To dispel the heat in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Howls block, Klein dropped the paper cup into the trash can and arrived at the second floor step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the door, he pinched his eyebrows and opened the vision in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just stepping into the reception hall, Klein immediately felt the faint sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorrow will always pass." Klein came to An Jielika and spoke gently and calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika jerked up, screaming abruptly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Morey Mr. Tie..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, she wakes up and asks strangely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Do you know what Mr. Vincent is doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I forgot that you are a good diviner."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sighs with a sigh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can only divinate the situation... Mr. Fansent What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The boss told us that Mr. Vincent had a heart attack in his sleep and left the world peacefully." An Jielika said When he spoke, he brought a few crying. "He is a kind, polite, real gentleman. He is a spiritual teacher of many members. He is still young..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry to make you more sad." Klein did not Do comfort, slowly toward the conference room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika took out her handkerchief, wiped her eyes and nose, then looked at Klein’s back and raised her voice:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moretti, what do you want to drink?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black tea." Klein prefers this than coffee. Although it doesn't feel very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relatively speaking, he prefers ginger beer, prefers sweet ice tea, but as a gentleman, formal occasions should not be like a child...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of Monday’s sake, there are only five or six members in the conference room. In Kline’s vision, their moods are different, some are really sad, really Slightly bleak, and some are almost unaffected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's normal... normal reaction." Klein couldn't see the dagger, holding a cane and looking for a place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was about to shut down the vision, and suddenly saw Angelique coming in and heading for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Moretti, there is a customer looking for you, um, the last one." This beautiful lady pressed down the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you remember him?" Klein smiled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I don’t know if the gentleman bought my magical pharmacy according to my tips... I don’t know if he still needs surgery...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only person who is willing to wait in the club for an afternoon is only him. One."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took his cane, stood up and went outside without saying anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the reception hall, he saw the gentleman who came to divination last time, and also saw that the color of the gas field in the other side of the liver has returned to normal, and the overall coordination is also the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, the taste of health is so good." Klein smiled and reached out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boghda first glimpsed, and immediately found both hands, firmly holding Klein's right palm:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moretti, you really can 'see' my situation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am cured! Doctors ask Again and again, checking over and over again, I still can't believe that I have healed like this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to Bogda’s ecstatic statement, gram Ryan calmly determined one thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How serious is the liver disease in front of this gentleman, which he saw with his own eyes, he can be cured within a few days, has exceeded the power of herbal medicine and medical skills, only extraordinary can explain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Glacis, there is only one answer left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to confess to God, I doubt you, doubt the magical pharmacist." Bogda held Klein's hand and refused to let go. I have been expressing my guilt and gratitude, "...the 10 pounds spent too much value, it bought back my life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? 10 pounds? Did you spend 10 pounds for the magic potion? And the divination fee you gave me was only 8 pence... 8 pence... 8 pence...pence... Klein almost sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Bogda loosened his hands and took a step back with a smile, respecting the way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I am here to express my gratitude, thank you, Master Moretti, you pointed out the direction for me and saved my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the result of your payment of divination. You don't need to thank anyone." Klein raised his head slightly and looked at the junction of the wall and the ceiling melancholy. The answer was very demeanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a true diviner." Bogda praised, "I will go to Vlad Street to thank the pharmacist, and Buy the medicine he recommended."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you not healed?" Klein hid his surprise very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bogda looked around and saw the beautiful reception lady did not pay attention to this, so she smiled low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "That is the addition of the mummy powder, can make a potion that both men and women are satisfied... I didn't believe the pharmacist before, and now I don't doubt it at all."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......and this agent? Klein suddenly felt that the pharmacist was a liar and wondered if he had pushed the opposite husband into the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and saw Bogda a few times and confirmed that there was no problem with the color of the opponent's gas field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mummy powder?" Klein cautiously grabbed a word and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, mummified powder, I have consulted friends, he said that the aristocrats of Beckland have been chasing this kind of thing crazy. This kind of mummified grinding The powder can give a man a perfect performance in bed, although it is disgusting and sounds dirty, but this is a real aristocratic material..." Bogda explained in detail that his eyes are full of urgency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mummy? Mummy made of corpse? The powder that is ground with it? Klein was shocked and almost vomited to Bogda on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles will play... When he was about to discourage the other party, Glacis, who had suffered from lung disease, just got started and heard the description behind Bogda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, very effective, I recommend you go to Vlad Street "Rossen's Folk Herbal Shop", Mr. Rosen's secret recipe is very effective! Glacius took off the monocle and leaned closer to it, recommending it down. "My experience is very, very, very perfect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know? I am going to Mr. Rosen's folk herbal shop." Bogda was completely relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few words, he can’t wait to leave the Divination Club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Klein has remained a little sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When at 5:20 pm, he put on a half-height silk hat, took a silver-plated black cane, and drove directly to Vlad Street. I plan to secretly observe the pharmacist named Rosen Duckweed and decide whether to report to the captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flad Street 18. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
