			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark, sturdy room, the stunned Dairik Berger slammed up and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His "Hurricane Axe" has been taken away, sent to check, the pockets of his clothing, also emptied, leaving nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick took a breath and calmly looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his eyes, there are two little sun-like lights that illuminate, so that everything in the room is reflected in his nephew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only one table and two chairs, in addition to the stone floor with singular patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are half used candles on the table, which is standard in all rooms in Silver City, because once the darkness is long, it is possible that monsters may suddenly appear. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick didn’t hesitate, sat down and reached for the half candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he smashed and smashed the candle into three segments, one segment occupying three-quarters of the original, and the two segments sharing the remaining quarters. One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Dairik’s adjustment, the candlesticks of the three candles were all highlighted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed his fingers to create a golden flame that lit the three candles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two at the top represent Mr. "The Fool", and the remaining one symbolizes Dairik himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before preparation, Dairik did not burn the herbal powder according to the normal process, dripped in the essential oil, and leaned back directly, mourning very quietly. The name of the "fool" and quickly entered the state of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mourned over and over again, monotonously and repeatedly, as if he was constantly hypnotizing himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of meditation, Dairik entered a state of eccentricity in which the mind was asleep and spiritually divergent, and the whole person was both embarrassed and kept peculiarly awake. The spirit is constantly going up and getting higher and higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "artificial sleepwalking". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick, licensed by Mr. Fool, can simplify some non-essential steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, in the ancient palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "fool" playing with "All Black Eyes" Klein suddenly saw the deep red star symbolizing the small "sun" swell and condense the adult shape Shadow, and the power of the mysterious space was shaken a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this situation, he could not help but sigh, because it means that the small "sun" has completed a relatively more dangerous pre-business, leaving only the final "finished" jobs". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not delay, immediately put down the "All Black Eyes" and picked up the "Black Emperor" card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His level, his personality, instantly becomes higher, and the forces that are swayed above the fog are surrendered one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he grabbed a paper man, shook his wrist, threw it out and threw it at the dark red star corresponding to the "sun." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper man meets the power of the water, and quickly expands into a huge angel with twelve pairs of twenty-four black wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Angel" penetrates the deep red light and overlaps with the shadow of the small "sun". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It burned silently, and in less than a second it turned into ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Klein has no way to influence the situation in Silver City, as to whether his "Angel substitute" can help the small "Sun" pass smoothly. He did not have absolute certainty in the inquiry and exploration. He could only sigh in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After doing the work done, try to finish the effort I can only wait for the fate of the arrangement, hope is a good result..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the stupid, Dairik saw an angel with the momentum of obscuring the sky and came to the front, and used the twelve pairs of dark The wings wrap themselves in layers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He violently wakes up, in the eyes of three candlelights burning quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely thanked Mr. "The Fool", Dairik ended the ceremony and extinguished the two candles that only accounted for a quarter of the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he pulled them up and created a golden, clear flame in his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tick, ticking, the two candles melted quickly, and the "tears" continued to fall, or fell on the remaining body, or surrounded by it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the candle burning completely burned out, there is only one candle left on the table, it is a little shorter than the original, but not very obvious, it seems to be just burning It took a little longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removal of the remaining traces, Dairiker extinguished the last dim candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat in silence and looked straight ahead, for a long time without any movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is worried that the "six-member panel" is not responding fast enough, so that those who explore the squad will carry more "silver" and "dumgo" to pollute more silver. City residents;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fears that "Chief" and others will find additional clues in the rest of the place to make their preparations unsuccessful;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hates those "outsiders" who are hiding in the depths of the dark, always carrying strong and malicious, including Amon, including "fallen creator";<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He guilty of avoiding this exploration, but did not remind Dak them to turn them into contaminated monsters;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was suffering from his own hands I removed a classmate who was a friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Although Dairik did not see Dak’s final end, he believed that the other person who became like that was already dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In complex and chaotic emotions, Derick did not know how long he had waited and reignited the candle in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he heard the sound of the seal being lifted and the door opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twisted his head, he saw a hair tied up and grows with a dim candle, and the woman in the black dress hanging down to the vest came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Aphrod." Dairik screamed subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Fulu has a beautiful appearance, but there are some wrinkles in his eyes. She smiled and daggered, responded to Dairik, and then sat down to the opposite side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have anything to say?" she asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick instinctively looked up and looked at the past, suddenly found that the other's eyes did not know when it became a pale gold mullion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking in an instant, Deric seems to have entered a state of sleepwalking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Fulu adjusted the candlelight so that the dim color was completely reflected on the face of the opposite boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her pale gold cock is getting more and more indifferent, like a viewer without feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, there was a circle of faint brilliance in the pale gold erect, which seemed to form a whirlpool and built a maze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the middle, Derick felt that he was floating, in the infinite darkness and countless vivid colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he suddenly woke up, only to feel that the state of sleepwalking was cleverly picked up by something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the infamous swaying dim candle, and saw Evlo sitting opposite, erected with pale gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow of the corner, the "chief" elder Colin Iliad, who was out of the hair, went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the "chief" was turned down, Evlo softly asked Dairik:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you do during this time?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric remembers the teachings and kept the state just now:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I have been confused It’s like dreaming, only occasionally awake...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time he answered, “The Demon Hunter” Colin’s eyes highlighted two dark green Complex symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avro continues to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know that you and Dirk Riggins happened "Is it a conflict?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only remember that I was fighting with him... I seem to have seen a man hanging up on the cross and saw a dress The man with the bonnet and crystal glasses, yes, I saw him in the dungeon... He spoke and smiled and spoke...” Dairik tells the story that has been compiled for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Fulu looked at the "chief" and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did he say? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't remember, I can only remember a little... He smiled and said, Fallen Creator, Real Creator... Shepherd..." Rick almost failed to control his inner excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took such a big risk, just to tell the "chief" about the name "fallen creator" and the "shepherd" suspect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fallen creator...the true creator...is very compatible with the contents of the murals at the bottom of the temple." Colin gently decapitated, frowning and whispering, "Shepherd ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After?" Aphrod's voice was unusually gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek confuses:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After they collided, There is a lot of light, bright light, I woke up, I have been coughing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark green symbol in Colin’s eyes has not faded, indicating Eve Luo asked for some details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick has chosen to answer, those who have long considered it, according to the script, outside the scope, push to Amon, say that they want Not up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Afflault asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where did your axe come from? Where did your 'Sun' route potion formula come from?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The axe was bought from the underground market, the man covered his face, only It can be seen that the sex is male... The potion formula of the 'Sun' route is what my parents left for me, found in a discovery...” Dairik did not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the doubts that have always existed. When they "think down", they think that they will inevitably appear, so let Dairik repeat the rehearsal of how to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The underground trading market of Baiyincheng is semi-public, but there are also people who try to cover up their identity for various reasons. This is Dairik. Provides the best explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai Fulu listened carefully, sideways to the "hunter" Colin Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He didn't lie, he couldn't lie, I have the power to use the 'Glory Crown'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin nodded:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this state, he did not show signs of evil, corruption, and pollution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found these things are The special ability of "Hunter". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a high-sequence occupation, the most powerful thing about the "hunter" is that it can cover up its own actions and intentions, so that targets that can predict danger are not noticeable. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, every "hunter" is a nemesis of the "devil." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
