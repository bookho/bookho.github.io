			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger of the "message" made Klein shocked for five seconds before returning to the sky, bending over and picking up the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if Mr. Azick is unable to use most of the extraordinary ability because of the problem of amnesia, he can only send this messenger and can deal with sequence 7 or even sequence 6. Extraordinary?" His heart reflected his own ugly and envious expression, not rushing to spread the stationery, but to put it in his pocket and put it with items such as "Sleep Charm". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage continued to move forward and arrived at Narcissus Street. When Klein stepped out of the door, he subconsciously looked at the driver, Sizel, and saw him with his face. Smile, calm and relaxed, and unaware of the previous things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change to the visual and take a look, Klein slightly invisible, and returned to his door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the balcony and the water pipe on the second floor and sank for a few seconds. He decided to keep the style and not try to climb. As for the blood. Point stained clothing, he will bring the black thorn security company tomorrow, the police department will come forward to the specific laundry woman to deal with, so as to avoid scaring the maid Bella and sister Melissa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving the window on the second floor, Klein secretly lifted the anti-lock of the main entrance, and at this time, staying up late, taking out the key, almost did not cause any movement Opened the door and swung agilely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After closing and locking the door, he quietly let out a sigh of relief and stepped back to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before stopping in the locked bedroom, Klein took a tarot card and inserted it into the door, making it light and simple. It alone disintegrated the anti-lock state that he himself created in a special way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he pushed the door inside, unlocked and undressed, and completely relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s like being a thief..." Klein shook his head with a smile and took the revolver without hesitation and stuffed it under the pillow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing the work, he lights up the gas lamp, takes out the letter paper, sits at the desk, and carefully reads:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I will write back to you now. I have been busy searching for the past and meeting with my former teachers and classmates. It is very late."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" After reading your letter, I finally understood what happened in the last two days. The hotel I stayed in first had a policeman to search for a room, and someone at the night quietly turned around. Yes, I am talking about people with extraordinary abilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It turned out to be the 'Hurricane Lieutenant' who often appeared in novels and newspapers. Ringos sneaked into Beckland and made a lot of killings. I remember that he was not only wanted by our Lun Kingdom, but also a list of rewards in the Kingdom of the Visak Empire, the Republic of Intis, and the Kingdom of Fenetport. Up..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what is the bounty? Klein subconsciously came up with such an idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't get the answer because Azick turned to something else:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Describe the 'Shepherd' ability, I feel very familiar, seems to have seen it, encountered, but can not remember, this should be my previous life experience, unable to complete the memory makes me feel very bad and distressed ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咦, Mr. Azke has a certain interest in the "Shepherd", this is the entry point for him to help, um, it is some coincidence... No, this is no coincidence, it is inevitable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the inference, Azke lived for more than a thousand years, and is likely to be a high sequence strong, then, in his earliest life, the previous time In the second life, I have definitely seen the extraordinary ability of many sequences, and I have been deeply impressed by the more special ones... In other words, not only the "Shepherd" can give him a similar familiarity, "no darkness", "Devil Hunter", "Guardian" and other occupations should also be OK...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the magical item corresponds to the ability of a certain sequence, then Mr. Azick I will be familiar with it, and I will be interested in what I can imagine...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and continued reading:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sacrificial ceremony you asked, I remembered it very early, it seems to be very impressive, maybe In one of my life, or the earliest life, I was a priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must remind you in advance, tell you Be cautious when using the sacrificial rites, and do not place your safety on the evil spirits and the conscience of some hidden existences. They do not have such things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, you must have a strong ability to distinguish, because the evil spirits will create a seemingly harmless identity for themselves. My opinion is that you cannot sacrifice to yourself that you are unclear. Your soul will also be a sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With easy-to-understand words, the evil spirits will wear vests and disguise themselves as easily trusted identities... Just like in the online world, behind a account that looks like a cute girl, maybe it’s a big problem. ...... even see the line, confirmed the appearance, they have to be careful, maybe it is women's big brother ...... Klein did not because it is to their own sacrifice, to ignore Mr. Azi Ke reminder place very much agree nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick emphasized the precautions and quickly explained the sacrificial rites he knew:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "First, arrange the altar, where you wish to sacrifice to a god or a normal hidden existence, draw the corresponding symbol, use herbs and ores belonging to his field, and of course, can also make pre-made holy oil , balm, incense, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;symbol? Klein stunned and found himself, that is, "the fool who does not belong to this era." He did not even know what the corresponding symbol is.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He The thought turned around, and soon associated with the complex symbol behind the high-back chair at the top of the bronze long table, consisting of a complex symbol that symbolizes the hidden "innocent eye" and some "distorted lines" that symbolize change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This should be my symbol, to be precise, my symbol above the fog... the field is simple, hidden, changing Good luck...but I can't be sure, I can only try to get it... Well, even if the symbol is wrong, the sacrifice target will not point to another existence under the premise of 'respect name', at most The failure of the ceremony, I can confirm this..." Kline thoughtfully picked up the surface of the paper and had a certain plan in mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze regains focus and looks at the follow-up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Secondly, you It is necessary to find out whether the sacrifice to the corresponding existence needs to be at a specific point in time, and then follow the normal ritual process until the tribute to the name and prayer statement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You must remember to use Giant, Dragon, Elvish, or Ancient Hermes to connect with the corresponding forces through their direct connection with the forces of nature. You can design your own sentences. But must have those key words, 'Pray,' 'Look', 'Dedication', 'Country', 'Door', 'Open'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Finally, you use a spiritual material, combined with the shock of the natural forces created by the mantra, to construct a preliminary passage, connecting to the passage corresponding to the 'national gate', if that interest, your sacrifice It can be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This step is not necessary If you can make the corresponding existence very interesting, then you have just finished the mantra, and he will open the 'national gate' and build a stable channel by himself. However, this often means danger because the orthodox god and still It is rare to do this kind of secretiveness. Only those evil spirits and demons will respond directly for certain purposes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The material with spirituality is not cheap... I don’t know if it’s just a mourning mantra. Can you open a sacrificial passage like “Summoning the Gate”, can you mobilize some of the mysterious space above the fog... Well, try it first, no longer Go to the underground trading market to buy spiritual materials... don't need extraordinary materials? Have a certain spirituality, right? Klein thought of 300 gold pounds in his unregistered account, and thought of the ten thousand pounds of private money that he had just picked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extraordinary materials are not exactly the same as materials with certain spirituality. For example, the heart of Hood Eugen's remains is extraordinary material, and those black scales are certain. Spiritual material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
