			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......I don’t need to mention it myself... I was a little embarrassed to speak... Klein sighed in relief and tried to figure out the German. The people of Sparo set up and said plainly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't take advantage of others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When the voice just fell, he regretted a little, fearing that "Iceberger Lieutenant" really changed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edvina light blue eyelids micro-turn:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only condition Yes, if you research something, tell me the answer.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call...Klein is no longer embarrassed, gently slamming:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, he returned to his room with the iron black key with a large lyre. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a fierce singer in the front deck:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You How charming the eyes are, like the morning sun;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every night, the darkness comes, I am alone, my heart is sad, waiting for the light; <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, how charming your eyes are, like the morning sun..." (Note 1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein subconsciously came to the window, the probe looked out, and saw the bonfire burned. The idle crew of the "Golden Dream" surrounded the side, or grilled fish, or sipped, or followed the "singer" Olvers. The singing voice is not standardized but is full of lively dance, and the atmosphere is extremely cheerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tempting scent of the fat burning scented out, and as Kryn saw Anderson Hood in the group of pirates, he was elated. I am very happy to eat, and from time to time, I have to recite a few words and tell a few jokes. It seems to have become a member of the "Golden Dream". It is not as repulsive as before. Instead, it is Deniz, and it does not appear outside. At least, Klein did not find him next to the "iron" and "bucket". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you don’t provoke, Anderson’s communicative ability is still very strong...this may belong to the “conspiracy” ability to collect information? Well, he may have transferred hatred to me...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if Daniz will work hard because of this, if he can improve step by step If you get stronger strength, then my "fool" will no longer have only oneself. I don't have to always show the status of the Trinity. Oh, my secret existence has a realistic believer, and there is a clerk who can directly command. For the time being, only Daniz is alone... I have to say that it’s still shabby...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, while feeling, will prepare for the ceremony, "Giant The key is sacrificed above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, his inspiration suddenly touched, and the instinct turned on the vision and looked to the side,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A white bone is thrown out and condenses into a messenger that burns the black flame in the eye socket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger’s body is on the lower level, so it’s almost flush with the German Sparrow, and no longer wears the ceiling, but it’s holding the letter. The palm is still huge, and seems to be able to wrap Klein's head directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Azick’s reply was very fast... Klein nodded politely and took the stationery and showed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was about to read the content, and suddenly found that the white bone messenger still stayed in place, not as usual, after the letter was sent, it disappeared directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?" Klein asked amazedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just had an opening, and his mind flashed an idea, and he added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "If you need to reply, I will call you again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last time Ms. Reneet Nikol has waited for a reply, this white bone messenger is also... Is this the new normative new charter of the 'messeng world'? Well, there is no such thing as 'the messenger world'. They all recruit themselves, and most of the messengers belong to 'part-time'... Well, just the white bone messenger gave me a feeling of a little wronged..." Klein shook his head, didn't think too much, and turned his attention. Transferred back to Mr. Azick’s letter: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...in simple terms, from the acquisition of divinity, the promotion of sequence 4, is a gradual evolution to mythological creatures The process of evolution, this process does not end until the sequence 2, so the angel and the saint have an essential difference. In the distant ancient times, the former can even be called from God.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Every demigod, including the saints and angels, has its own mythological biological form, a non-human form that combines complex knowledge, divine qualities, and hidden symbols. Ordinary people just look at it. Will suffer serious injuries and even mental disorders, and The higher divine Person, the more similar the injury, the more irresistible, so this level of creature must always control yourself, do not expose the appropriate form, otherwise only exists in itself, will bring disaster to the surrounding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the demigod, a major feature of out of control is that you lose your mind and can no longer converge on your own mythological creatures.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, the mythical biological form of the Holy One is not complete, and there are obvious original racial characteristics. Strictly speaking, it must reach Sequence 2 to be a true mythological creature..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not know that the blood that Ms. "Hidden" wants is the true mythological biological blood, or can be looser... Oh, I don’t know Will. The umbilical cord blood left after Ting’s birth is not counted. He is the “snake of destiny” in sequence 1, an absolute mythological creature, but the state is not too much... and so much more, it can be written on a paper crane. And ask him, um, there are only two opportunities to write, you must be cautious enough, but I will return to Beckland again... Thinking of it, Klein silently counts Will. When will the snake of destiny be born?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not accurately recall According to the impression, Will Anthony was pregnant in November last year, and now it is mid-April.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he will be in July Will it be born? Maybe it’s a little earlier... Klein didn’t think too confidently, after all, he had no girlfriend, no wife, and no children in his life.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He quickly converges his thoughts, temporarily puts this matter aside, and begins to arrange the ceremony to sacrifice the "Giant's Key" to himself - the reason why the spirit is not carried, because the key is too heavy, Klein is now Still moving.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he came over the fog and let the huge black iron key fly to the surface of the bronze long table, and carefully checked a few Once again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there is nothing unusual, he has a paper pen and wrote a divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The place where this key corresponds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding the paper and holding the key, Klein leaned back on the back of the chair and fell asleep in the low thoughts.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the first thing in the gray world is the twisted translucent barrier. Then the picture is zoomed in, and there is a heavy gate that is more than 10 meters high.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This door is mainly blue and gray, with many symbols, logos and patterns symmetrical on both sides, both solemn and mysterious.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The light of the evening is blurred, so that the door of the opposite door is obviously degraded, just like the whole world is near, the eternal darkness is coming.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Klein noticed that on the left side of the door, three or four meters high, there is a dark hole, equivalent to the adult fist.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene is quickly broken, the dream ends, and Klein opens his eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is similar to the black monastery but the color The same door...the light of the evening... My interpretation is that this represents a certain door of the 'Giant Wang Ting'... Well, the earliest layer of distorted translucent barrier should be isolated from the outside world. The symbol, therefore, without the use of fog to eliminate interference, no matter how divination, can not see the desired picture ..." Kline fingers tapped the edge of the long table, made a certain judgment in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
