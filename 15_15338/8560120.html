			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒哒哒, the radio ticker spit out an illusory white paper, written in Lunwen:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The great master, your loyal and humble servant, Arrods, finally catches up with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...... Don't be so excited... Well, "Magic Mirror" Arrods's speaking skills are as professional as ever. I don't express the "remorse" that I can't contact for a long time. I didn't ask me why I didn't find it for so long. I blame myself on the problem, thinking that I have not caught up with my pace... I am a little bit embarrassed, but the defense is still prepared... Klein didn’t know how to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrods did not wait, using the radio ticker, and made a cautious probe on the illusory white paper: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great master, the dominator above the spiritual world, your servant feels that you are one step closer to returning to the Holy See, is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article has evolved so fast that it has evolved from the use of Yan Zi to the prototype of building emoticons... In the understanding of Arrods, I am one step Step back to find your true God? So, although it is clear that I only have sequence 5, but still not a bit slow, but more humble? Klein understood that "Magic Mirror" was deliberately asking questions and nodded calmly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You have already answered my question, in exchange, as a rule that I must abide by, you can ask me a question." Arrods "typing" responded quickly, and at the end attached a "smiley face" ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not hesitate and asked directly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where can I get it?" Master's potion recipe?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unreal white paper is spit out a long, full of countless complex symbols, and then forms a mirror , showing a real scene: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a deep temple without natural light, there is a huge squirming thing, it is so vague, As for the pencil drawing erased by the eraser, there is no way to see any specific details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, "Magic Mirror" Arrods has a large paragraph attached below the scene:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This is Charatu, he lost control in the process of promotion sequence 1 'The Secret Waiter' and became a monster, but the great master you have to be careful, He is a very cunning guy, maybe it all The performances are all deliberately made by him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't look at him, it will hurt me, except for Him, you can't do anything at the secret meeting. The demigod was given a recipe for the potion because Charat was originally a high-ranking potion that was directly supplied, and there was almost no way to reverse divination through extraordinary characteristics. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is well detailed, and I also know that the sequence 1 corresponding to the "Divination" route is "the secret waiter"... It means serving A secretive angel? It seems that the secret society will only be able to get the potion formula when it is facing Charat, and I can't even look at him... No wonder the "Destiny Snake" Will Unsetin only Speaking of the mad Chalat, not mentioning the secret meeting... Klein was touched by the attitude of the "mirror" Arrods, if not that he did not have the personality and strength to control the seal, He intends to really regard each other as his own servant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the crisp voice, the illusory white paper grows again, showing Another scene: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a winding mountain with a run-down palace and a huge stone seat in the palace.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is familiar with this picture, but without the "mirror" Arrods annotation, you know What it means:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treasures of the Antigonus family hidden in the main peak of the Hornaces!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;White paper continues to be spit out, new scenes are presented, and like a movie, there is a change in the perspective of the lens:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to enter Klein It is a towering Gothic clock tower and a magnificent palace surrounded by it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former represents the "clock of order" and the latter represents the Sodrak Palace, which are the landmarks of Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lens movement, a new building soon on white paper, a pure black church with two symmetrical clock towers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This church is getting bigger and bigger in the scene, and soon shows the interior, and the iron black is fixed at a certain position on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gate is extremely heavy, engraved with seven dark holy emblems, just like the guards of the heavens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chanes Gate...Saint-Saill's Church..." Klein recognized the familiar door and determined that the church was based on architectural features. The Night Goddess Church, the headquarters of the Beckland Parish - St. Saul's Church! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White paper spit out, the picture turns, deep darkness, an empty bookshelf composed of roots and bones, quietly posing an ancient Note that its cover is made of hard paper and dyed black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein recognized this note at a glance:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the death of the body Antignus family notes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going around, everything is back to the original point! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quietly watched for a while, and waited until the picture disappeared before he found his own thoughts:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Also, the people of the Aurora meeting saw the 'Jun''s potion formula from this note, and I got it to recognize it. When I look at it, the content presented above will definitely be different from the past. There should be a potion formula of '诡师', but lacking material or characteristics.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original note has been sealed in the church of Saint-Saill After Chanis Gate, if you want to get it from such a place, it will be no less difficult than looking for Charato and facing Him... The Bakerland smog event with high sequence scores involved in my passing After Miss Justice’s report to the church of Beckland Parish, it was quickly settled. This is enough to show that the power of Beckland’s parish is strong. Whether it’s a demigod or a seal, there is no shortage... Well, no matter what. First, return to Bakerland to see if there is a chance. I don’t want to compare it. The Hornachs Range..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Converging the thoughts, Klein looked at the dark and deep radio receiver:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last night, who was the half-god on the boat of the 'Crazy Captain' Connor Victor? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the cymbal blew, the illusory white paper in front disappeared, and the new one was spit out.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content on white paper is also a real scene:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the beautiful lamp holder made of brass, five candles are distinctly Exuding light and heat, a middle-aged man wearing a cocked hat and black eye mask stands in front of a cabinet of wine, champagne and distilled spirits, humbly looking across.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The opposite of him, there is a tall figure with a black cloak, his face completely hidden under the hood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure does not seem to have a real head Only a deep, twisted darkness was set on the neck.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the portrait on the reward, Klein recognized that the one-eyed man was the "crazy captain" Connors - his hair is scattered and greasy, just covering his neck.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite should be the demigod, but he deliberately Putting on his own look and doing the corresponding anti-dubbing, Arrods can get a picture of this degree is quite remarkable... Klein is not too disappointed, but seriously remembers the figure of the figure: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 meter 85 or more, but less than 190...the arm is slightly longer, the knees are almost reached when the hands are hanging down...the shoulders are wide and the cloak is held...double The legs have a certain degree of external bias...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an expert in the field of camouflage, Klein believes that after a person has concealed his appearance and carried out a certain degree of anti-dubbing, It is very likely that you will not pay attention to the camouflage of your body, especially if there is no special place in itself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this can provide some clues and help I feel familiar when Klein sees the target in the future!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
