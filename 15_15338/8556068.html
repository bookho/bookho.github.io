			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Rose Manor, a luxurious room filled with antiques. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stood at the door and asked about the sixth maid who was encountered today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young maid is dressed in a black and white maid dress with a period of character, looks good, youthful, brown hair has some natural rolls, with a little bit of playfulness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which people will meet with Mr. Talim when he comes here?" Klein numbly repeated the previous question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid replied with almost no pause:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Talim is generally seeking to see His Royal Highness Or accompany him to ride a horse, or discuss things. If the prince is not there, he will meet the lady. They are good friends and get permission from the housekeeper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thalim and the civic woman whom Prince Edesack likes is a good friend? Will you meet privately from time to time? He should be persuading the other party to leave here, so as not to affect the prince's reputation... Klein nodded thoughtfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They, I mean, tower What will Mr. Lim and the lady talk about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this question was raised, Klein remembered that Tallim had fallen in love for some time. The performance, with the rich "experience" from the information age, inexplicable brain to make up a dog's blood to the extreme romance story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid is not afraid of the big detective, smiles and shakes her head and says:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time we Will be asked to leave the room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...Klein is increasingly unable to restrain himself from developing associations, and even thinks that Prince Edsack’s hats and helmets should be Change the coating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he asks again, the maid smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moratti detective, If you want to find out what the lady and Mr. Talme have specifically talked about, you can ask her directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old housekeeper does not allow." Klein arrogantly launched a shield against the arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to know more than the previous servants, I even know how to call me Moriatti detective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid glanced around and kept smiling:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I am rotating to serve the lady, she always wants to see Moriarty detective. After all, she is a good friend with Mr. Talim and cares about his death.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, she always misses with you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Always? "Klein is very sensitive to the words "always," "just right," and "missing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid nodded seriously:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When His Royal Highness invited you to be a guest for the first time, she deliberately lost her temper and wanted to take a walk downstairs to meet you. Who knows, you hurried away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After that, she offered to replace the Prince's Palace and lay flowers at the tomb of Mr. Talim, but I couldn't find you because I didn't know your looks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And today, she happened to go to the golf course to go around, otherwise, even if the housekeeper does not allow, she will find a way to see you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a coincidence... Kline just sighed and suddenly grasped a key point:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp On the day of the funeral of Tallim, the prince who went to the flower to give the flowers was the civilian woman he loved!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what Klein cares most about that day is the face mask black A veil, a lady wearing a sapphire ring, the other party is likely to be wearing a “0” seal, or it is a strong presence at the same level!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, Klein’s mind flashed back the picture at the time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman wearing a sapphire tail ring was wearing a heavy black dress. Accompanied by the two maids, they gradually went away...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the two maids has brown natural curly hair...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image of the maid quickly overlaps with the maid in front of Klein, and it fits perfectly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s body slammed tightly, and the vest’s sweat dripped out, but the expression did not change at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the power of the "clown", he made memories and smiled and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the day of Tallim's funeral, did you follow the lady?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid responded intently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......艹, really her! Klein keeps a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, next question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like Nothing happened. I asked other things step by step, and then continued with a servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Klein secretly shortened the process and speeded up the progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to grab the red rose manor before the lady returns! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At four o'clock in the afternoon, when the sky was not dark, Klein gave a lot of leave ahead of the expected time, and returned to the city by a horseman dispatched by the old butler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the window, leaning against the wall wrapped in silk, cotton, etc., he finally relieved, and spared no effort to relish the whole thing: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse of Talim is the beloved civilian woman of Prince Edsack...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She Why do you have to deal with a fallen aristocratic descendant and retaliate against Talim for trying to break up the actions of her and the prince? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, she does not need to do it by herself, find a chance to shake this thing out of bed, Prince Edsac has a way to let Tallim Silently disappeared...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talim was completely in love before his death, um...the first sign was that he successfully persuaded the civilian woman to leave Ed After Prince Sak... They have adultery? So, the civilian woman who was brought back to the manor to curse Talim in order to eliminate the hidden dangers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logically makes sense, but the question is, how can a big man with a "0" seal or a strong man at the same level be Edsa? Prince Ke is restricted? Even if Augustus is an angel family, with enough accumulation, it has to use enormous power and adopt a special method to be able to live in it. This is not something a prince can do...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, how can such a character be able to see Tallim? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did she always want to see me? Do you realize that I use the fog to peep? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, if that's the case, I will be buried next to Tallim's funeral... In addition, when she first wanted to see me, I didn't get the flesh and blood. , hair and personal belongings, did not do any divination! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wondered inexplicably, and finally decided to bury the problem in his heart, not to explore, not to investigate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that "Mechanical Heart" has my previous reminder that I can find that the royal family attaches great importance to this matter. Yes, their attention may not be for The reputation of Prince Edsac, but another reason! I hope that the royal family will continue to restrict the lady so that she will not visit her. After a few days, the timing is right, I will hand over this task, saying that I can do nothing, and then use the excuse of going to the South for an excuse to change my identity. Avoid some time! Klein’s mood gradually calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland’s dusk will always be dimmed by clouds and ripples Instead of the light rain of the leaching, Klein, who was quite exhausted in body and spirit, pressed the half-height silk hat, buried his body, and quickly walked through the wet streets, and returned to Minsk Street under the illumination of the gas street lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little rest, taking advantage of the dim environment, he took four steps back and entered the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the promotion sequence 6 "No Face Man", he always wanted to check if there was any change in the mysterious space, but it was too tired last night, midnight I didn't wake up, but I was "busy" outside during the day and could only wait until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Klein has to rule out interference and divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is after the promotion, when the spirituality is not stable, he did not hear "Honakis... Fregra... Honachs... ...Fregra" this illusory proverb! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to figure out whether this is a natural change after the upgrade to Sequence 6, or is there another reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the majestic palace, the mottled bronze long table and the twenty-two high-back chairs with different symbols on the back stand quietly and seem to have never changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog under them, and the emptyness around the end, is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as soon as Klein entered, spiritual instincts were keenly aware that the mysterious space was a little different from the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not in a hurry to explore and try, calm down the emotions, sit at the top, have a pen and paper, and write a divination statement:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason why I didn't hear the slang after I was promoted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand holding paper, low opinion, Klein With the back of the chair, with meditation, he quickly entered the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray sky and the earth, a picture flickers and finally settles on a scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Klein when his face and body were still full of pale granules. His surroundings were filled with a layer of illusory, thin, gray fog that no one else could detect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream is broken, Klein opens his eyes and understands the reason:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fog and The reality is intertwined, helping me to shield the slang that I don’t know where I came from...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After the promotion sequence 6, I was more connected with this mysterious space above the fog. Close, so it has brought about certain changes, and can naturally rely on a little power? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the moment, it should be like this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, try to explore around and see What is the change? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slowly got up and followed the inspiration to go some direction outside the ancient palace, and the foot was covered with the mist of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, when he wants to stop, and when he gives up exploring, there is a flash of light at the end.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has a happy heart, speeding up the pace, and moving closer together.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven or eight seconds, he saw a ladder leading to the heavenly ladder !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ladder is condensed by pure light, sacred, transparent, clear, and can shock everyone's soul.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ladder extends above the void, only four layers, each layer is quite high, as prepared for creatures larger than the giant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Klein looked up in its direction and saw a grayish white mist that condensed in the air, seeming to hold something, and the light ladder had a certain distance from it.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four steps, which means I have finished the sequence 9, sequence 8, sequence 7 and sequence 6 potions? What is above the fog? What is Klein before caution? Go to the ladder of light and step on the steps.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steps are not weird, solidly like stone.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein followed the ladder and climbed up to the fourth floor, then tried to look over the grayish white mist, but unfortunately his sight could not penetrate.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it, going forward two steps, trying to jump up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
