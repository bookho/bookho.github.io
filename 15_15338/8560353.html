			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A illusory black thin line extends from Senegal’s body and is thrown into Klein’s palms, with each spirituality. Jumping makes different reactions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, manipulating the "line of the spirit" does not necessarily require both hands, but Klein is used to doing this, which gives him a kind of self-control of the secret. feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the current situation, peers can find each other's embarrassment, the anomalies on the line of the spirit can not pass their eyes, so this aspect It must be cautious enough.” Klein summed up the initial findings and quickly turned his mind back to Senolol itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "above the blood" is equal to having died, the spirit becomes the attachment of the scorpion, and loses its own specificity, so many divination methods are no longer Effective for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the method of finding the type of corpse is still useful. Klein intends to let this "resent" pass the fog to "kill the poison" and then use " The Paper Man Angel wrapped his mirror-like objects, and finally placed them in an iron cigarette box with a spiritual wall blockade, and stayed with the Aziz copper whistle to make triple interference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Klein believes that the angels of the Rose School want to use the "blood admiral" to lock their position through divination, prophecy, etc., which is almost impossible. Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the "desire mother tree", there is no "back door" left in the body of Senniol, he is not too worried, because if the "desire mother tree" is really " Above the blood, "the body has moved hands and feet. When the half-god was fighting, He could make Seniol suddenly change and deal with himself. According to the situation at the time, this will certainly succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The strict control of the 'Desire Mother Tree' or the 'Bounded God' is dependent on the pledge of the soul, etc. Inferred from Miss Sharon’s description, state, and my own experience with the corresponding characteristics...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as I don't try to use the 'blood above' The secret of the Divination Rose School and the potion formula of the 'heterogeneous' route will not trigger the problem. The extraordinary character of the 'Wolfman' was placed on the fog for so long, and it is normal...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, there is a foggy 'disinfection' process, and there are some hidden problems that will be cleared out..." Klein thought for a while, will be Aziq copper whistle Take it out of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his right hand and let the place with less copper whistle pattern appear under the sun, and the mirror reflected the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The copper whistle suddenly appeared on the scene of Senigal, and quickly became clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "blood on the top" in front of Klein suddenly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe 'desire mother tree' can still be vaguely positioned through vows, etc. But it doesn't matter, anyway, he can detect the foggy traits of me, I have sensed me within a certain range... And, when such a cockroach is said, it will be destroyed by the shield I used to be..." Klein is like an unemployed owe who owes a lot of debts, and feels that he has nothing to fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he did owe a lot of debt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you are promoted to a demigod, you can hide the traits, you can throw it when you say it... Klein looks around and bends over and picks up the silver. Necklace, go back four steps, and read the mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This time he did not enter the way of summoning the spirit, so he could not return directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray mist is flying fast, the hysterical slang and embarrassing eternal reverberation, the Aziz copper whistle in Kline’s hand has not changed, which means “ There will be no big problems hidden in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sitting at the top of the bronze long table, Klein put the Azick copper whistle in front of him, letting Seneo wearing a dark red coat wearing an old triangular hat It appears on the side of the body, like a housekeeper waiting for the owner's order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else do you have on your body?" Klein asked, as if "the blood is above" is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is trying to play the "Master of Secrets"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he manipulated Senigal and asked him to rummage through each pocket of his body, and successively pulled out 325 pounds of 16 Sule 8 pence cash, including ten Three gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these, perhaps because of the relationship that often turns into a "grief" form, Senilol does not carry more items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "True poor... a pirate general, there is only one magical item? Is this handed over to the rose school and assigned to the pirates?" Klein seriously considered whether or not to use the black market channel to realize the problem of "blood above." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is worth only 42,000 pounds in a country in Lun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it’s unrealistic to receive a reward from Lun, whether it’s the Storm Church or the Kingdom’s military, they are happy to follow this clue to get a lot of people. Gilman Sparo, who is a melee, investigates the organization behind him and does not give money at all. It is also a trap...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same reason, Churches and governments in other countries are sure to have similar ideas, but the attitude may be better. It takes a considerable risk to collect the bounty...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" And don't worry, when I want to change the cockroaches, I will send Senegal out. Anyway, doing a few days of secrets will not affect his identity and value..." Klein regained his thoughts and turned his eyes to that. A silver necklace with an ancient coin-like pendant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately used the divination method to roughly grasp the origin and function of the necklace:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a sequence of life 5 "winners", this gentleman died in the hands of the rose school demigod, the extraordinary character, the spirit of itself combined with a common silver necklace carried around, formed a magical item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was the original silver necklace originally worn by a strong 5 player, because things were polluted too long, and Klein could not Get effective inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical item has two functions. One is to passively make the wearer feel lucky: in daily life, the owner of the necklace will encounter good things from time to time. Everything is easy to succeed. In the event of a fatal blow and a terrible disaster, there is a dramatic scene that allows him to be saved successfully. The latter can only last for ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is to actively give the enemy bad luck, so that the goal becomes unlucky, both in life and in combat, it is easy to fail due to some minor problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negative effect of the necklace is "conservation of luck". After lucky, it will continue to die badly. How lucky it was before, how bad luck it will be. The owner needs to concentrate on it and evade it very seriously. Otherwise, it is easy to die in a funny way, even to the people around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The luck gained in daily life often reverses after one month, and users will become unlucky with or without wearing it. However, this misfortune is Released in a soothing manner, the degree of danger is not high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The luck gained in the battle will be reversed in the same fierce way after ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Overall, it's a pretty good magic item, but it's not too big for me. After all, even 'Destiny Member' Ricciard can't do it. Change my luck... Well, wear it first, it has almost no negative impact on me, I have the opportunity to sell it, and repay the messenger’s debt... The messenger wants gold coins, and I have the gold pound, I want It is almost impossible to exchange 10,000 gold coins through the bank and the formal market. It seems that the scores are divided into batches, and each member of the Tarot will be responsible for each part..." Klein quickly finalized the plan, very casual. The name of the necklace was taken:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lucky Balance"! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he once again turned his attention to Seignor, who was standing next to him, and carefully studied the abilities of the grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forcing possession, controlling enemies, screaming screams, mirror flickering, penetrating obstacles, death-like spells, not found by most low- and medium-sequencers The "invisibility"... Klein identified them one by one, and told Sharon and Maric, as well as the contrasts they experienced in battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly ended all this, fearing that the candle in the real world would burn out, and that the cave with no light was very unfriendly to him who was currently afraid of black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately took a paper man from the pile of debris, cooperated with the "Black Emperor" card, combined with a little force above the fog, incarnate it for the sake of Divination "angel". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This angel quickly opened his wings and hugged a gold coin. The reflection of this gold coin has Senigal’s figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
