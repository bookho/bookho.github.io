			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I need? "The Hidden" Jia De Li Ya smirked and noticed the little temptations that "hanging people" are hidden in normal problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clue if there is demand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention that I have already obtained the "Mystery" route of the "Mystery" route, and is contributing to one of the main materials. Even if there is nothing, I will not lack the corresponding channels, and there will be more than one... Jia Delia thinks about it and thinks of the "Poseidon Scepter" in the hands of Mr. Fool, and smiles and says:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need a semi-god magical item, the negative effect is relatively affordable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This moment, "downside down" Alger almost directly blurted out, telling the other party not to joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the storm church, it may not be able to receive a similar item for several years, not to mention the extraordinary one in the sequence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are negative effects that are relatively affordable for semi-god items. Why don’t I stay for my own use? Alger understood that the "hidden" was responding to his temptation in a mocking manner, but he was not as violent as most of his colleagues, and slowly took a breath: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I will pay attention.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you should be very clear, only a valid clue for such items, perhaps worthy of the 'sea singer 'The potion recipe. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... is very deep, not easy to be angry, which is not the same as the general style of the storm church... Is my first observation conclusion wrong? Was he really a priest who pretended to be a storm? No, he couldn’t think so. This may be because Mr. Fool’s gaze made him afraid to anger, or maybe he himself belonged to the Storm Church’s alternative. Too many, but certainly not very rare... "The Hidden" Jia Delia has no greed, did not make a second temptation, nodded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the end of the conversation between the two, no one has asked for the transaction, and some of the members are because they want to get what they want, no need to buy again. This is mainly for the "justice" Audrey and "Magic" Firth waiting for the follow-up formula, and the other part is limited by the economic situation and its own situation, temporarily not spending early, including the thirst for the Evangelion heritage. "Moon" Emlin and Miss "Magician" who wants to get a magical item.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, as everyone gets rid of the low sequence, promotion is not So fast, the frequency of transactions is falling rapidly. In the past, there were only one or two orders per week. Now it may take two or three weeks. In the future, it may take three or four months... "Footer" Klein does not know whether this situation is good or not. Dust gently decapitated, indicating that everyone is free to communicate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey immediately looked to the "Sun" Dairik, waiting for the other party to tell about the occurrence of Silver City Change.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily Ke did not live up to her "expectation", robbed before everyone opened, sincerely said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lordya Elder was released, I met in the library she was. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shepherd" Lovia was released? The entire team led by her was contaminated by flesh and blood by the "real creator". How could she have no problem? What did the six-member council of Baiyincheng think about? Klein wanted to use "if Luo Weiya had no problem, I screwed my head down and gave the 'real creator' as a ball kick" to express my doubts, but Considering that the curse swears that if it involves the gods, there may be bad follow-up, and the reason has changed the mind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is above the fog, in fact not Need to be so cautious... He felt a word in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elder Loyya was released? That ‘shepherd’? "Justice" Audrey recalled what the name represented.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small "sun" used the "渎神者" Amon possessed With the help of Mr. Fool, the whole exploration team was defiled by the “real creator”, and the leader of the exploration team was Luo Weiya, and her “shepherd” occupation was also in the “real creator”. "The corresponding "secret person" approach!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "The Sun" Dairik nodded sincerely and looked at the "downside down man" next to her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Alger thought about it, he turned and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have your chief returned to Silver City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did Mr. 'down man' suddenly ask about this matter... Ah, release an important person, and the other members of the six-member panel cannot wait for the chief to come back...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the chief has not returned, and they made a decision in advance, indicating that things are more serious than imagined, so serious that they can't wait for the chief... If the chief has returned, then release Luo There are a lot of probabilities in Wei Ya that are related to his adventures, because according to the small 'Sun', this is the only exploration of Silver City in the recent period...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Hey, I didn't think about this just now, Audrey, your experience is still insufficient..." "Justice" Audrey is half-reviewed and half relieved to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, just a while ago." "The Sun" Dairik was a little surprised by the accurate guess of Mr. "Hanging Man". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the quietly listening "Magic" Firth combined with the previously learned material, suddenly got an idea:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. 'Sun', will it be such a situation?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your chief with the exploration team and the small Boy Jack went looking for the road that could lead to the outside world. He found that it must rely on the power of the 'real creator'. Oh, this is not a lie that I made up, but a fact-based reasoning. The boy’s father belongs to the 'Aurora Yes, they are the sanctuary of the 'real creator' who came to you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, for the entire Silver City, after your chief returned, decided to release the 'Shepherd' Lovreya."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case, Mr. Sun will be very dangerous next." "Justice" Audrey said with concern, listening to Dairik's heart sinking quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "hanging people" Alger shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No My opinion is just the opposite.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'Magician''s reasoning is consistent with my guess, but I think, this way, the 'Sun' will be better than It’s safer in the past! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? "Dyrik must be in the heart, and asks questions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not very simple? Balance! "The Fool" Klein snorted in his heart.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The danger of 'real creator', as long as there are intelligent creatures with eyes and brains, you can detect that your chief will never put all the chips in him, he will inevitably Seek to balance the power of the 'real creator'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you reveal through their conspiracy, you may have been represented by the 'God of the Devil' Amon."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luo Weiya, the more they want to hurt you, the more the chief and other elders will protect you, so that you may have some unclear doubts before, they will also Pretending not to see. "After hanging people," Alger simply explained.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good thing? "Magic" Firth is a little bit stunned.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The man who hangs down" makes a lot of sense... In analyzing the situation and the situation, I still have a big gap with him... "Justice" Yan Li was slightly frustrated, and even wanted to drum up the gang, but immediately thought it was not elegant and decent, and only thought about it in the heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They Besides, it is unclear that Loyenne's "moon" Emlin is quite strenuous, but knowing the little boy Jack and the fateful cycle, he still barely understands what others are discussing.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to break through the plight of Silver City, they released a "danger" involving "real creator"? Emlin made a guess in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with him, the "hidden" Jia De Li Ya did not understand anything, only that he and other members do not seem to be in a world <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I actually got the kind of 'what they are saying, it seems to be very powerful, but I can’t understand the feelings'... the last time there was a similar It feels like many years ago, when I was still very weak... The previous Tarot would have some vague indications, especially when it comes to Silver City, but it’s not as serious as this one...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
