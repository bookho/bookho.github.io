			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After half an hour of rest, he thought that Klein’s Zhou Mingrui had slowed down, during which he found that his right hand had four black dots on his back, which happened to be composed. Small squares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four black spots faded from deep and disappeared quickly, but Klein knew that they were still hiding in their bodies, waiting to wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Four points, squares, is it the correspondence of four staple foods in four corners? I don't need to prepare a staple food in the future, I can go straight to the steps and spells. "Klein has a guess in faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may seem good, but it’s a bit more interesting, and the lack of understanding of “things” is always frightening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine that the inexplicable techniques on the earth can produce effects here, and then think of the strange crossings in your sleep, and then think of mystery, psychedelic, and unknown. What the foggy world, and then think of the "ritual" in the surrounding, people close to the mad whisper, Klein could not restrain the chill, and shuddered in the hot weather at the end of June. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once heard a saying: "The oldest and strongest emotion of human beings is fear, and the oldest and strongest fear is fear of the unknown." Now, he has deeply realized the fear from the unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unprecedented, unstoppable, he raised the urge to touch the mysterious field, learn more, break the unknown, and also buried his head, pretending Nothing has happened to escape the thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun was shining outside the window, and a layer of "golden powder" was placed on the desk. Klein stared at it as if touching a touch of warmth and hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He relaxed a little, and immediately felt the raging exhaustion of the tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleeplessness of last night, the consumption just now, makes his eyelids heavy like lead white, can not stop hanging down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shake his head, Klein stretched his hand to the edge of the table, refused to pack the rye bread placed on the corners, and walked to the bed, just As soon as I lay down and touched the pillow, I fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunger awakened Klein, and he opened his eyes and was refreshed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a bit of pain in addition to the head." He rubbed his forehead, rolled over and sat up, feeling that he could now eat a whole cow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smoothed the folds of his clothes and returned to the desk, picking up the silver-and-white pocket watch with a vine pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lid pops open and the second hand ticks away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Twelf and a half, slept for more than three hours..." Klein swallowed and put the pocket watch in the linen shirt pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Northern Continent, the day is also divided into twenty-four hours, sixty minutes per hour, sixty seconds per minute, as for the length of each second and the earth is Not the same, Klein is not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For him, at this moment, even the words such as occultism, ritual, and foggy world cannot enter the mind. The most important thing at present is food and food! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can find a way to eat! Can do things! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no hesitation, Klein took the rye bread from the four corners back, bounced off a little dust, and planned to take one of them as a staple food for noon. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the hometown has the custom of offering food after the sacrifice, and the four rye breads seem to have not changed, he has only five pennies left in his pocket. In the case, I feel that I still have to work hard to save a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this also has the subtle influence of the original main memory fragments and living habits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of rye bread, you will eat it when you eat it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, do you want to have dark bread in the morning, black bread at noon, and meat in the evening... No, if Melissa is coming for me Interviews consider that you can only eat two meats a week..." Klein, who is ignorant of hunger and can't think about serious problems, looks around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the pound of lamb, his eyes looking at the cupboard seemed a bit green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, I have to wait for Melissa to eat." Klein shook his head sharply, denying the idea of ​​cutting the first half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a single dog drifting in a big city, although he mainly eats food, the basic cooking is still honed, not good. But it is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning over the body, Klein intends not to see the net, just then, he suddenly remembered that in addition to buying meat in the morning, he bought a new pea and bought it. potato! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potato! Kline was instantly inspired, twisted back in a whirlwind, rushed to the cupboard, and took out two of the few potatoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the common bathroom to clean the skin of the potatoes, then placed them directly into the pot and cooked them with water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he took the spice box out of the cupboard, uncovered the lid, and sprinkled a little yellowish and coarse salt into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patience waited for a few minutes, Klein lifted the kettle, poured the soup without the soup into a few cups, poured into the big bowl, and finally the two The potatoes forked out and placed on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He peeled a little bit of skin and blew his hand, the smell of cooked potatoes spread a little bit, hooking appetite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saliva is secretly secreted, and Klein refuses to peel only half of it, and the potato is still hot, and he takes a bite when picking it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powder! Fragrant! The back is sweet! Klein's heart was full of emotions, devour the two potatoes, and even ate some skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, he picked up the big bowl and sipped the mouth of the soup. The faint salty taste washed away the dry mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I was young, I loved it so much..." Klein, who had padded his stomach, silently sipped the rye bread and soaked it with "soup". Eat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the previous "ceremony" was too expensive, he ate two full, a whole pound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking "soup", clean up, Klein feels that he has lived completely, and experienced the joy of being born and enjoying the splendour of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat back at his desk and began to think about what he should do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't escape, you have to find ways to touch the mysterious realm and become the extraordinary in the mouth of 'justice' and 'downside down'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To defeat the fear caused by the unknown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only way at the moment is to wait for the next 'party'. See if you can hear the recipe of the 'audience' potion, or other mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are four days until Monday, before that, you have to face up. The original owner’s own question, why did he commit suicide, what happened to him...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t cross back, pat the butt and leave, Klein picks up There are no clues as to whether or not this open note is going to be turned over to see if it can fill the broken pieces of memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, the original owner has the habit of taking notes, and also has the hobby of taking notes as a diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein clearly knows that the cabinet that serves as the right leg of the desk is full of finished notebooks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On May 12, Mr. Azick mentioned that the lingua franca of the Southland dynasty empire also originated from the ancient Fossic, which is a branch of the giant language. Why is this? Is it true that all spiritual creatures have used it? The same language, no, this must be wrong, even in the records of The Revelation of the Night and The Book of the Storm, in an era older than the ancients, the giant is not the only lord of the continent, and the elves There are also different species, and dragons, okay, this is just a legend, just a myth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp "On May 16th, Cohen's senior associate professor and Mr. Azke discussed the inevitability of the steam era. Mr. Azke thinks this is accidental. If it is not the sudden emergence of Russell the Great, maybe the North Continent is still Like the South China, it is still in the cold weapon era. The instructor thinks that he emphasizes the role of the individual too much. He believes that with the development of the times, there is no Russell the Great, and Robert the Great. In short, the steam era may be late, but it will definitely Come on. For them Arguing, I only feel that it doesn't make sense. I prefer to discover new things and restore them to the misty history. Maybe, I shouldn't read the history department, I should read the archaeological department."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On May 29, Welch found me and said that she had obtained a fourth-episode note. My Goddess, Quaternary notes! He did not want to ask the students of the archaeological department, would like to ask me and Naya to help explain the contents of the record, how can I refuse this kind of thing? Of course, I have to arrange after the graduation reply, this time, I can't be distracted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Klein’s spirit is better than the previous reading notes, ideas, and the new Quaternary "Notes are more likely to lead to the suicide of the original Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Quaternary is the era before the "Black Iron Age", the history of which is full of fog, many missing, even unearthed mausoleums, ancient cities and literature There are very few, historians and archaeologists can only rely on the ambiguous and faith-based theological texts of the seven churches to reconcile a little "original", knowing the Solomon Empire, the Tudor dynasty, The existence of the Truncost Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dedicated to breaking the fog and restoring history, Klein has no interest in the more pre-three-time myths and legends, only cares about the "age of the gods" The Quaternary, the excitement can be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, such a trip, the original owner valued the interview, worried about future employment, in fact, no need..." Klein could not help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current university is still very rare. The vast majority of students are aristocratic children and wealthy children. As long as civilians enter, even if they are discriminated against because of their identity, they are not included in others. Social circle, but as long as it is not extreme, relying on group discussions, group activities, etc., it is still a valuable resource for people who can get certain resources! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Welch McGovern is the son of a banker in Constance, a county in the Kingdom of Rou, who is bold and prosperous because of the long-term And Klein, Naya in a group to do homework to report, so habitually ask them to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a lot of thoughts, Klein continued to read the notes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"June 18 I graduated. No, my Hoy University!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On June 19th, I saw the note, after comparison of structure, roots, etc. It was found to be a variant of the ancient Fossic. More precisely, in the history of more than a thousand years, the ancient Fossic language has been subtly changing."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On June 20th, we interpreted the first page of the content, the author is a member of the family called 'Antigonus'."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On June 21st, he mentioned the 'Black Emperor', which is completely contradictory to the era derived from the previous content. Is the opinion of the instructor wrong? The 'Black Emperor' is actually the Solomon Empire. The common title of the emperor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On June 22nd, this family called 'Antigonus' seems to have a prominent position in the Solomon Empire, the owner of the note Going to a secret transaction with someone called Tutu. Figure 铎 铎 铎 Dynasty?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“On June 23, I controlled myself. Don't think about the note, don't go to Welch, I have to prepare for the interview! This is very important!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
