The painful time of patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life is full of expectations..." She closed the novel in her hand and was about to turn off the iron grid gas streetlights embedded in the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Fols saw a flower in front of him, saw the boundless fog, saw the tall figure in the majestic ancient palace, saw one A man who prays piously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice came into the ear, she almost jumped up, and she was shocked and happy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been searching for the "master of tricks" formula for many years, so I found it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been involved in so many different extraordinary gatherings, but there is always no clue to the "drama master" formula, so I found it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not been a week since I asked for it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, this is the Tarot... It’s not an ordinary extraordinary meeting that can be compared! Forsy felt a moment of emotion, endured excitement and joy, and responded cautiously: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool's, is that formula true?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." On the high back chair, looking down at the "fool" below, he said plainly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls violently clenched his fist and quietly waved twice in his waist, almost without thinking about it:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the 'world'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please tell him, I will find what he needs as soon as possible. Items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fog dissipated, everything was over, and Fols stunned for two seconds, and it was difficult to stop the excitement and stand up and squat back and forth in the room. step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the solar field, an item that is characterized by purification and exorcism... I have only met twice before, but they have all been bought by others, and the other party may not be willing to Shot... Well, before the meeting convened by Mr. A, I invited a believer in the “Eternal Vigor” to do the purification and exorcism rituals. He should at least sequence 7, should have similar items, or hold relevant clues... ...I don't know how much gold pounds to spend, although Mr. "World" promised to make up the difference, but I may not be able to get the part that needs to be paid in the early stage... Fols gradually shifted his thoughts to his own financial situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She now has £370 in cash, mainly from the premium paid by Viscount Glylint for the “pharmacist” formula, and there are 510 in her bank account. Pound deposits, which add up to nearly £900. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a similar item, expensive may cost 2,000 pounds, cheaper five or six hundred pounds, may not be the type of "world" Mr.... What should I do if I encounter the right thing and my money is not enough? Going to a bank loan, or looking for a loan with a higher interest rate, as long as it is smooth, and waiting for the "world" to pay the difference, my debt can be easily paid off... Maybe, I can find Miss Audrey for a few days, she always cares. Money, certainly will not receive any interest... Fulth quickly has a package of solutions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, taking advantage of the night to go outside in a secluded place to exercise fighting ability, returning to the rented two-bedroom, seeing the room of Foers is still bright With the light on, I knocked on the door and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to write a new book at the beginning of the day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Forehead, Fols, you seem very happy, the publisher has raised your remuneration?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, no." Fols A moment, piled up with a smile, "I just received a message, suspected to be a clue to the 'Master of the Master' potion formula."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? You I finally waited for it!" Hugh did not notice the hidden shape of Fols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following a friend’s happy appearance, Fols couldn’t help but sigh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;I have become a member of a secret organization, and I have to bear the fate of always concealing and deceiving my friends...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this one of the costs? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday morning, Klein once again went to Saatchi Street, St. George's District Visited the inventor Reppard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the bicycle patent has not been applied, he only paid the last 20 pounds, and the other party should not rush to find someone to discuss the follow-up investment before actually getting the patent. Cooperation matters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Reppard strongly agrees that he had two inventions before and was squandered based on the same factors - before getting the patent, The potential investors who contacted knew the product clearly, so they kicked off and watched the other party buy the staff and got the patent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the Repard family, Klein arrived at Essinger Stanton’s slightly darker seat in the Hillston area at the scheduled time. Dimly house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the date of the series of murders! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the living room, into the previous living room, Klein saw the two more familiar detectives, Kaslana and Stuart, and sat down. Next to the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock, how many bounties do we get this time? It should be no less than protecting Atru. Of course, I don’t do much work. , can be divided into limited, Russell the Great said, one point of hard work, one point of harvest." Stuart hand fists arrived at the chin position of the beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein guessed with great interest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than a few hundred pounds, less It will not be less than 10 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am the one...if Essinger Stanton is as reputable as he describes himself... ... Klein added a word in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the horns are white, the face is thin and the outline is clear. Essinger is wearing a white shirt and a brown vest, holding a symbolic pipe and entering the fireplace. The burning living room, sitting on the armchair that belongs to him, smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ladies, gentlemen."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just returned from the Beckland Police Department, they recognized our contribution and thought that we provided crucial help for the cracking of the case."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although we did not participate in the follow-up round-up, we can still get half of the reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, we Will be divided into 1,000 pounds of cash!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a very generous bounty in Beckland, a single detective does not eat or drink and sleep on the street four It takes only five years to get there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the living room suddenly became easy, and the expectations of its own bounty were everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Klein is no exception, he is guessing how much Eisinger will give himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least a hundred pounds? He whispered silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger took a pipe and squinted his eyes, very satisfied, saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your trust in me, I am making an assignment now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The biggest contribution of this time is the detective of Sherlock Mori, he provided A few ideas and ideas have led us to find clues and embark on the right track. He is a veritable reasoning expert!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This, Caslana Ms. can confirm that I still keep a few letters written by detectives Moriarty, and the people who are questioning can take a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very Just... I didn’t even list myself as the biggest contributor... Klein was a little bit stunned by Essinger Stanton’s big detective:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder he Very authoritative in the detective circle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing no objection, Essinger nodded lightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I announced that the bounty of Sherlock Moriatti's detective was £300! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanging, the detectives in the living room whispered and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They looked up at Klein from time to time and seemed to finally know the good detective who was praised by Stanton as a reasoning expert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a generous person, a fair person... Klein opened his mouth and ended up not being modest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second place in the bounty is Eisinger himself and Kaslana, who each took £160, and the rest of the detectives relied on different contributions. The remaining 380 pounds were divided, the lowest of which was 15 pounds, which is equivalent to their usual three-week gains. This is the benefit of a large case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart, who got 40 pounds, was very satisfied because he felt that he had only observed for two days, and the object of observation was not suspected of later locking. By. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, his 40 pounds are also paid for part of it - the informants and helpers involved in the matter must be fully taken care of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the reward, Stuart suddenly remembered one thing, while taking a piece of paper from his trouser pocket, he said to Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock, I recently took a very rewarding task of finding people, you launched your resources, help me pay attention, if I can find, I will not be less "You have that one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, no problem." Klein replied uncomfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart handed the paper in his hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is this People, missing for nearly two weeks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because he is related to unruly things or some degree of crime, the client does not want us to find help from the police. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded slightly, unfolded the paper, and saw a black and white photo of the rubbed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;It is a man with a hair slanting and combing, with a few chic men in the seriousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is about twenty-seven years old, looks handsome and handsome, but there is undisguised arrogance in his eyebrows, his nose is tall and his lips are thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, he called..." Stuart recalled the next way, "Emlin White."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White... Klein suddenly turned his head and looked at Stuart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn’t this the name of the vampire who was imprisoned in the basement by Father Utlavsky? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the residence of the Duke of Nigan, was invited to participate in the afternoon tea party Audrey was a little bored to listen to the mother and the Duchess pulling them to chat about some things between the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes swept through the exquisite three-layer bracket, sweeping through the delicious items such as muffins and cakes. I feel that she has some indulgence of appetite recently. Take a teacup and sip a lipstick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, she was apologetic and got up, accompanied by a maid, went to the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just out of it, she met a tall, middle-aged woman with a tall, eyebrows and a graceful dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sister of the Duchess Jura, the wife of a hereditary Viscount, Mrs. Norma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After each other, Norma looked at Audrey and chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say that our beautiful girls are very interested in occultism?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the occultist, is it the person of the psychological alchemy, to test me? Audrey immediately turned to the "reader" state and replied with a low-pitched answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
