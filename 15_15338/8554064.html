			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of silver, in the smashing room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik Berger sat by the bed and quietly recalled the information about the Seven Gods that he got. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the god that has never been heard before, the plausible ancient myth, shows him a new world that is completely different from the area where Silver City is located. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that a land that has not been abandoned by God? Or, the land that is blessed by the new god?" Dairik sat in the dark without any action. From time to time, the lightning flashes through the window, bringing a strong light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly concentrated his thoughts on the authority of the seven gods, and compared it with the ancient gods such as "The Dragon of the Dream", Angelweed: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The so-called 'God of War' is very close to the giant King Olmer, the authority of 'The Lord of the Storm' is similar to the Elf King Sonia Sorem, 'Night The goddess seems to be the combination of Fregra, the king of the demon wolf, and Lilith, the ancestor of the vampire. The eternal sun, the earth god, the god of knowledge and wisdom, the god of steam and machinery can not find similar..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About myths and legends, I didn’t listen carefully enough when I was in class, and I missed a lot of places..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Call, there is no patrol mission during this time, go to the Minaret Library to flip through the information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek Horan stood up and thought of doing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His problem is also a problem for most residents of Silver City. When receiving general education, the focus is on "demonics", "monster taxonomy", and "character" In practical courses such as “The Extraordinary Foundation”, you can use it to deal with the dark monsters and increase the production of edible plants. When listening to auxiliary subjects such as “mythology”, it is often not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the history of Silver City can make residents more united and enhance their sense of honor and mission, the "six-member council" has a very good grasp in this regard. Strictly, Dairik believes that he can remember what happened in the last two or three decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "Hurricane Axe", Dairik walked out of the house and walked along the clean, simple but ancient mottled stone road to the twins in the north of the city. Outside the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twin towers are a spire, a library of silver city, a meritorious exchange point and a living material distribution office, a dome, belonging to the "six-member parliamentary group". It belongs to the rumored magical items that support the more than two thousand years of silver city, belonging to the formula and material warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the minaret, Dairik went straight to the third floor, and based on the impression, found a bookshelf with mythological materials and corresponding ancient books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just looked at a book about the creation myth, and was about to take it out, but found that a five-finger slender, fair-skinned, well-looking palm took the lead. Take the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick looked at his arm and looked at it. He lowered his head and pressed his chest to say hello:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Elder Lloydya."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the members of the Six-member Committee who took the book "Shepherd" Luo Weiya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Wei Ya wore a black robe embroidered with many mysterious purple lines, silvery gray hair but with a little curled draped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face is smooth and white, her eyebrows are gorgeous, and she looks like she is in her early thirties. A pair of light gray eyes can penetrate the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." In the face of Dairik’s greetings, Loyya gently nodded and said nothing, silently holding the book to leave. Between the two rows of bookshelves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luoweiya elders seem to be normal, unlike before, they always switch between different states, sometimes crying, sometimes sneer, sometimes roaring , sometimes indifferent... Dairik’s subconscious mind flashed such thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he is inexplicably scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normal...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the full file, Klein has no Find records about animals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, the original survey ignored this issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, you have to remember the previous thoughts, you can't recklessly investigate on your own, don't mention whether I have enough special circumvention of the 'devil' for the danger and Grasping, it is possible to encounter the responsible night, it is very troublesome, my goal has always been to assist, analyze the case, make guesses, judge the true and false clues..." Klein thought about how to do it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After understanding the "devil" ability, he temporarily dared not give the investigation to the previous suspects whether there are pets to Stouat, this is not Small ones may kill each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now is only a preliminary undirected investigation, Stuart should not encounter anything, 'Devil' is not the group of madmen of Aurora, no Will actively expose themselves, the day after tomorrow, Stuart will certainly be able to submit a report, perhaps there are hidden clues that others can't detect." Klein stood up and walked back and forth in the living room with his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with his current dilemma is how to let the main investigative case put the animals into sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct mention, certainly not, it will lead to suspicion, secretly guiding too obvious and the same... Hey, I am not an "audience", no such extraordinary Ability... Klein thinks carefully, carefully scrutinizes, and finally determines the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the stationery, held the pen, and wrote:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Stanton Mr.: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought of a problem. When the detectives discussed it, they thought that the murderer’s action was very skillful and they could not see the traces of birth. Sophisticated, I believe this can not be born, there must be a wealth of experience based, such as surgical students in medical schools, such as butchers in the butcher shop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I At that time, I guessed that he might have done a similar case before. This is a direction of the investigation and the focus of my current attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But after these two days Repeated thinking, I think this is incomplete, perhaps, he does not rely on murder to gain experience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no such possibility, he uses pity Animals practice hands? Live, different kinds of animals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every day in Bakerland dead animals Statistics, disappeared in the depths of the sewer, no one knows, this is a good practice object."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The above is my immature view, hope Communicate with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock. Moriarty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not Directly mentioning the murderer may be a demonized animal, and find a reason to practice, hope that Essinger Stanton will take note of the neglected "animal world" and remind the responsible official extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing and writing, he suddenly felt that this was also a direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "demon" has never been captured because it is hunting animals most of the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And animals hunting animals are not something to watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like this, I hope to bring them inspiration... Klein folded the letter paper and dressed neatly to the post of the post. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fifteen minutes, Jurgen’s lawyer looked at the Sherlock Detective passing by the belly window, and finally couldn’t help but open the door, politely ask道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Moriarty, have you forgotten the key?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's right." Klein squeezed his smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this OK? Klein took a second and smiled sincerely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my pleasure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Jurgen’s grandmother’s grandmother is a chef! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you can also pick a cat by the way! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the darkness, the full-fledged Klein is at home Rested for a while, took a cane and left Minsk Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He plans to go to the rose street in the southern part of the bridge and ask the Utravsky bishop to ask the origin of the "master key." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "Buddle Method", he successfully arrived at the Harvest Church in the dead of night, sneaking in accordance with the last route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Utravsky bishop did not repent in the church hall tonight, only a row of seats in the quiet and dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you resting?" Klein was slightly puzzled to go to the living area behind the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just around the corner, he suddenly found that the tall Utravsky bishop of the giant is climbing up the stairs in the basement, where the heavy stone gates are Pai patted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is he detained in the basement? Klein instantly thought of a series of unhealthy news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Utrechtsky bishop looked up and saw Kline, who was wearing the previous disguise, and was quite surprised. He asked: <br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You haven't found a way home yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......I look like someone who has been lost for so long? ? Klein pulled out a smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, I am not lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think That recipe is fake? Impossible..." Uttraski bishop frowned and stopped halfway through the steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, he is equal to Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, that's true." Klein answered honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the stone door of the basement was slammed again and more and more intensely, accompanied by the male voice of "put me out." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is?" Klein couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Utravsky bishop is gentle and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A vampire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice just fell, the man in the base floor shouted loudly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to the vampire? Should the vampire be locked up here? Should you listen to you every day, listen to you mourning the scriptures? Hey, I am a noble blood family, don't describe me with such a rough name!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I tell you, I admire the moon, I will never convert to the Mother Earth! Give up, you are a wicked priest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Klein was the first to meet a real vampire, could not help but ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Father, where did you catch him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Utrechsky bishop’s expression looked at Klein eccentrically:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the original owner of the 'master key'."<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One day, he lost his way into the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Klein seriously thought about carrying "universal" The problem of the key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
