			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, the dome is in the towering palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Footer" Klein looked at the "sun" that was pulled in advance and the "world" that was pre-existing, and spread the spirituality, touched the representative The deep red stars of "justice", "downside down", "magician", "moon" and "hidden". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a ray of light, and the relatively blurred figures appeared on both sides of the bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Justice" Audrey, who just returned from the forest to the castle, has been put on a dress, with lace on the cuffs and pressed with round pearls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up lightly and skillfully, imagining the skirt and performing a ceremony:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, 'Mr. Fool'~"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has improved a lot, nodding his head and responding to each other. At the same time, he couldn’t help but sigh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rich are so expensive, the aristocrats of 'Justice', how much expenses do they usually have..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the members greeted each other, he looked forward to it. To the "hidden", knowing that this pirate general will provide a new Russell diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the "hidden" Jia De Li Ya took the initiative to speak:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' Fool's, I have collected a page of Russell's diary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one page? Shouldn't the "mysterious queen" come up with a copy? These days, the tried and tested Klein did not see a trace of anomalies, and gently slammed the first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia De Li Ya immediately had a yellow-brown diary, watching it fall into the hands of Mr. Fool in the spirit of the shuttle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein predestined to look down casually, and was slightly surprised to find that there was no corresponding date at the beginning of this page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, it is the second page of the connected diary... Why did Bernardie not take the first page, she should be able to make a preliminary resolution After all, the old Neil can do it... Isn't she? Or the diary is completely confused and confused, she is difficult to restore the correct order? Does this mean that Russell’s great man is falling behind, his belongings have been robbed by various forces, and he has diverged, and Bernard’s ambition has not been able to compete, and he has become a “mysterious queen” before he begins to do the corresponding Things... Klein guessed and quickly read the contents of the paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really unexpected, the Quaternary history revealed by Mr. Gate’ More and more interesting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This unfortunate guy trapped in the storm, lost in the depths of the dark told me that the 'Black Emperor' died once, It was resurrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is strikingly consistent with some of the things mentioned inside the ancient secret organization. At that party, they said, the nine secrets of the 'Black Emperor' If the mausoleum is not completely destroyed, even if the god walking on earth is really dead, it can be revived from one of the tombs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And even the nine The mausoleum was completely destroyed. As long as the order established by the 'Black Emperor' had a certain residue, He could also come back to the stranger. Only the birth of the new 'Black Emperor' would allow him to completely annihilate and never again. appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the story of Mr. Gate, the process of the resurrection of the 'Black Emperor' has three stages. One is the 'uniqueness' from the owner, conceptual abstraction, Second, the subjects of the 'Black Emperor' heard the voice of the gods again, and the third was the 'black emperor' that merged with the 'unique' reappears in the 'star world', and the three sequence 1 extraordinary features automatically returned to them. In the hands of the emperor, this is the order that other true gods cannot reverse the unstoppable order.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way, the same sequence of the route 1' The Blood Emperor's and 'Night Emperor' are quite embarrassing, and it is very likely that they will fall into a random position and fall back to Sequence 2. Mr. 'Men' said that at the time, 'The Lord of the Storm' and 'The Goddess of the Night' chose the 'night emperor' to help him turn to the extraordinary path of the same, that is, the 'Judge' route, '图铎-Trenso The Union of Empires splits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the blood emperor Alista Tutu, who was forced to desperate, made a crazy decision, that is, to go to an extraordinary path that is not close, and forcibly promoted to be the true God at the expense of losing reason to become a madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It must be said that this decision is full of irrational colors, almost impossible to achieve, but Mr. Gate told me, Arista.铎 Finally succeeded, the most crazy true God was born! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really incredible, but Mr. 'Men' did not tell the specific details, there are reservations.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I asked him, which is more unacceptable for madness and death. He said that of course it is death, because as long as he is alive, even if he is completely crazy, there is no way to recover." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He laughed and exemplified that a crazy true God can mate with various creatures by instinct and give birth to various descendants. In this process, if you are lucky enough, conflict The extraordinary characteristics are all sorted out, and the madness will get better with a long time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. 'Men' deliberately did not say this There are still some problems left, and there is no explanation why almost no one makes similar choices, but I can hear that there must be great hidden dangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to say that Mr. 'Men' has more than I imagined about the true God, and He is probably already trying to shock before he is exiled. Sequence 0... No wonder He is full of disdain for Charato and has no respect for the true God.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to put him back in the real world. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of information is so big... It’s a one-page diary that Bernard has specially selected...etc. Why did she choose this page? What is the significance of her? From this day, Russell the Emperor slowly went wrong, and finally went crazy? Crazy...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does...no Well... Russell’s situation at the time was very similar to the “Blood Emperor” Alista Tutu. The original route has been cut off, and the neighboring route is blocked by people or things. It’s not so easy to climb... Is it? Is it that under great pressure, he made the same irrational decision as the "Blood Emperor" and tried to move to a non-adjacent route?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way The madness of his later years is that he really lost his senses, not being splashed with water. It’s no wonder that Bernardi turned his back on him, hated him, and tried to find the truth... From this perspective, some things are very interesting. Sergeant was enthroned as the emperor, and Russell enacted the Civil Code, replacing the original with the 18th and 19th century order of the Earth. Then, Russell spreads his own quotations and promotes his own aesthetic...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I really look down on the fellow and "predecessor", I have been I thought he was in Cosplay Napoleon and Caesar, and he was entertaining himself. He was preparing for the "Black Emperor"... No, his diary at the time, I also read a few pages, with clear thinking, normal mood, and even In-depth communication with a noble lady of a certain noble lady...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, he may not have made the final decision at that time, but consciously left a path ?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great probability of the Civil Code is not what Russell intends to do. As a squatter, the promulgation of a new law is an inevitable choice. Among the reference objects, the Civil Code is relatively in line with the social situation and historical process...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsequent act of emperor should be that Bernardie felt that he could not Understand, a little unacceptable... As Russell’s favorite child, she may be before her father’s emperor I noticed a certain anomaly, so I chose the longest diary written by the Emperor during the period to "the star above." Klein couldn't help but think of it. He seemed to see the heavy history hidden in the depths of the fog in front of himself. Opened a page full of blood and rust.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him more curious about Russell’s ultimate crazy fuse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he also untied some of the previous doubts:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original 'black emperor' returned with this The way to resurrection is very similar to my previous guess...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the history of the Quaternary, there is still a 'tuque-Trenns Special Union Empire's support by the six gods such as 'The Lord of the Storm' and 'The Goddess of the Night'... The two side-by-side thrones in the remains of Williams Street seem to explain, this belongs to the Union Empire...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to Mr. Gate's statement, the Six Gods chose 'Night Emperor', leading to the Union Empire Split, then, who helped the ‘blood emperor’ to catch or kill the three ‘hunter’ route sequence 1? Among them, the 'red angel' Medici is more powerful than the ‘blood emperor’ at the time... the original witch? grim Reaper? The original moon? The dark side of the universe? Desire mother tree? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
