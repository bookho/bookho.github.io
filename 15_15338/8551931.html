			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein hadn’t had time to turn to new ideas, and he saw the stiff Menard’s hands clasping his hands and holding a heavy wind, and he’s quite straight. I rushed to my left! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before doing this, he suffered from such an unexpected situation. He was mostly slow to respond, and it was difficult to avoid. Even if he noticed it in advance, he would have to turn around in time to escape. Out the range of the opponent's slap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, Klein has almost responded instinctively, and the bright, buttonless boots have slammed and the whole person jumped up and jumped to the high back. Chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he was promoted for one day, he was not particularly comfortable with his strength, agility and speed. In a hurry, this jump jumped too high. The position of the foot is actually the top of the back of the high back chair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a narrow one, and Kline’s heart is tight, and the body is quickly controlled and the center of gravity is adjusted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook a few times, and stood so steady, like a black cat that showed off balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While shaking, he waved his left arm and followed the "live corpse" of Maynard’s rushing force, and his cane pumped its side ribs. I pumped it out of balance and slammed it down on the carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stood at the top of the high back chair, his right hand hurriedly lifted up, explored his armpit, tried to pull the revolver from the gun bag, and gave a living body in front of him. Silver hunting demon bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, he suddenly thought about how to deal with the problem at the end of the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a shot was made on the body of Mr. Maynard’s body, how can I explain the cause of death to the new party members who care about this matter afterwards? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just made a shot at his body? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the flash of thought, Klein reached into the same side pocket of the police uniform with his right hand and touched a triangular piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ansoul Charm... He quickly made a judgment, did not hesitate to take out the silver spell and shouted out one of the ancient Hermes Words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blush!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the reverberation of the opening spell, the spell is emitted Peaceful and serene, Klein was busy pouring spirituality into it and threw it at the "live dead" Maynard who struggled to climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue-blue flame is soaring, the parcel ignites the triangular slice, and the quiet and soft black melts quickly, eliminating the tension and uneasiness of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The living corpse" Maynard stopped there, his empty eyes staring at the ground, and the mucus in the corner of the mouth fell on the blanket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein breathed a sigh of relief, he was going to take out the materials, arrange the ceremony, and use the purification method to solve the unclean creatures in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Maynard’s throat rang again, and the empty eyes looked at the left pocket of Klein’s police uniform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rub... Klein jumped from the top of the high back chair to the window sill of the belly window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he heard the sound of the high back chair falling and breaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein of the scalp and hemp had to touch a rectangular piece of silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "Sleep Charm"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only live talents need to sleep, the deceased itself is in the "long sleep", must be abnormal to wake up, squat on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some occult books, even describe some "live dead bodies":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They sleep during the day and wake up at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein once again shouted out the ancient Hermes spell, and intended to fail again this time, without considering the consequences, pulling out the revolver, a random shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only to be alive can trouble the follow-up problems! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling that the silver flakes in the palm became cold, Klein poured into the spirit and threw it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark red flame illuminates his eyes, and the slight explosion slams into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of quietness and softness comes out, with the exhaustion that makes the creature irresistible, "live corpse" Maynard just from the broken high back chair Climb up, shake it a few times at once, close the empty eyes and plunge down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the experience just now, Klein did not dare to relax, immediately took out the "Amanda Pure Dew" and the dragon extracted from the night vanilla, deep sleep flower, chamomile mixed distillation The "full moon oil" made by the bark and the moon flower quickly arranged an altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he followed the "Silver Powder" and used the spiritual wall to block the nearby area, and the altar and the sleeping "live dead" Maynard Included in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutely recite the mantra, click on the corresponding three candles, and drop the pure dew oil into the candlelight. After sprinkling the herbal powder, Klein takes a step back. Watching the "live corpse" Maynard with vigilance, mourning in Hermes: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The night is more noble than the stars, longer than the eternal night Goddess;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for your care;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for you to care for you A faithful guardian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for the power of blush;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for peace And the power of silence;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for you to purify this unclean creature near me, who was once called John Maynard."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The moon flower, the herb belonging to the Red Moon, please pass the power to me. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deep sleep, it belongs to the red moon Herbs, please pass the power to my mantra!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sound During the meeting, it seems that the cool breeze blowing from the middle of the night echoes in the spiritual wall. The "living body" Maynard has a thin black mist that transpires out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything subsides, Klein uses the divination method to confirm that the other party will not "wake up" again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw the result, he completely put down the heart that was carried, ended the ceremony and lifted the wall of spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How could he suddenly swindle?" Kline stood in front of Maynard lying on the carpet, looking down slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an extraordinary person who is not indifferent, there is a clear sign that the deceased will not swindle, let alone Klein is a "diviner". There will always be some hunch about similar things, but the changes just made are completely unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless, unless there are more mysterious factors... just like the tuxedo clown... Klein recalled the scene just now, faintly aware of the problem :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Live corpse" Maynard has been trying to attack the left pocket of his police uniform! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left pocket? Klein handed the silver-plated black stick to the right palm, let his left hand reach into the pocket, and took out an old copper whistle placed inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a copper whistle covered with mysterious patterns, a copper whistle that Azke lends to him to summon a messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This copper whistle led to the corpse of Maynard? It is possible that Mr. Azick is not a descendant of death, but has a certain connection with death. He The magical items that are always carried have a similar effect.] Klein nodded thoughtfully and pulled out a copper penny. He made a quick divination on the judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is affirmative... Mr. Azke did not remind me of similar problems. The amount... He is an "amnesia" patient. I don't remember that it is normal, and the copper whistle is on him. It may not have a negative impact. It is very likely After being suppressed... After going to the cemetery, the castle, and other places with many bodies or haunted ghosts, you can't carry this copper whistle, otherwise you will add difficulty to yourself and go crazy... Klein silently remembers this new summary. Matters needing attention, it was not laborious to get the undressed Mr. Maynard back to the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the sharp marks of the other side of the ribs, Kline sighed, covered with white cloth, pretending not to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is left to the police department! Well, the two spells just belonged to the task consumption, and they can be reimbursed... He thought about collecting the good things, took the portrait and went to the door, and lifted the anti-lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops, the door opened, and Klein saw Tolre inspector staying outside and not let anyone close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened just now?" asked Tolle, confused and worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He vaguely heard that there was no small movement inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and replied deliberately:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Menard Come over and try to give me a warm hug."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be kidding..." Tolle looked helplessly in the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is it so serious?" Klein spread his hand. "Because the issue is still uncertain, Mr. Maynard became a living corpse. It is the kind of ghost story. Fortunately, I have not left, and I used ritual magic to clear the uncleanness in time, and let him return to the tranquility of tranquility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this related to his cause of death?" Tolle asked with a serious expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't give you the answer, I don't even know what's wrong, you should be clear, things that can't be explained in our field are quite common." Klein perfunctoryly, and swayed the portrait in his hand. "When I was psychic, I saw the scene before the death of Mr. Maynard. He was sharing the joy that the couple should have with the lady. I caught my heart in the happiest time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean...he is the cause of death?" Tolle said, "You know." " looks like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Theoretically, it is subject to subsequent dissection." Klein handed the portrait to Into Inspector. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tole only glanced at it and exclaimed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at each other blankly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is famous? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, from the aspect of appearance and body, it should be more famous... He spoke in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teller looked around and said with a little excitement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. It is the most famous and beautiful widow of Tingen City, and the most sought-after woman in social situations. She is the second wife of Baron Hoy, but unfortunately became a will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is popular among the wealthy businessmen in the aristocracy, and is a celebrity who can be invited by the Conservative Party and the New Party at the same time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It is said that she and her stepchild, the current Baron Hoy, and some of the aristocrats of Beckland, and several senior government employees have an awkward relationship, a very energetic lady... She and Maynard are also in this relationship...嘿..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, an excellent social flower... Klein secretly summed up , pointing sideways inside the house:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next step is not in my task, how to interrogate Mrs. Shelen . & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp your problem "<br <br /> & nbsp />;</div>
