			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a "diviner" who just entered the door of occultism, Klein did not dare to say that he knows a lot, but he certainly knows a lot more than ordinary people. A variety of divination can be divided into three categories according to a certain standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this standard is the source of "revelation"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first type of divination includes Tarot, poker, spiritual pendulum, wand and dreams, etc., with the help of the "inquiry" of his spiritual and spiritual communication. "Revelation", to interpret the results of divination, but the spiritual pendulum and the scepter method have high requirements for spirituality, spiritual body, and star spirit. It is not extraordinary that cannot obtain accurate and obvious "revelation", while card divination is used. The idea of ​​fixing the symbolic elements in advance, so that the "revelation" of ordinary people can understand and feel, the dream is between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second divination method has a spiritual number, astrology, and all types of derivation, and the fortune teller calculates or speculates by asking objective information provided by the person or natural change. To interpret the corresponding results, the initiative is not asking the person, the diviner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third method of divination is to use third-party powers other than diviners and inquirers, which discs and pens that Klein knew in his life belong to this category. Through a certain ritual, requesting an unknown, mysterious existence directly gives the answer. Although the probability of ordinary people is not successful, if there is a case, and communication exists to a person who is full of malice or light contact, it will often be brewed. Into a tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "magic mirror divination" that Heinz. Vincent just mentioned belongs to this method - in occultism, the mirror leads to the unknown, Leading to the gates of the wonderful world, Klein stopped outside the conference room, intending to listen to what the famous diviner would explain, to decide whether to inform the captain, to "copy" the other's gas meter in the middle of the night. Expendables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, "the magic mirror divination" also has a safe way, that is to pray for answers to the seven orthodox gods, even if it is difficult for ordinary people to get real " Revelation, at least there is no danger, there are sequelae. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of "magic mirror divination" that is strictly controlled by night-timers, punitives, etc., is to ask some organizations to believe in evil spirits or mysterious existence, and I can't do it at random, maybe a certain word, a certain trait leads to unknown attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world of extraordinary power, similar divination will always develop towards very bad results, and Klein even suspects that the original Lord and Welch, Na According to the notes of the Antigonus family, Ya made a similar "black divination." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Hainas also explained to the five members the principle of magic mirror divination and began to describe the specific process:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, choose the appropriate date and time according to the gods you believe in. This can be decided by the Astrology Handbook. For example, we all know that Sunday is the symbol of the goddess of the night, rest. The manifestation, and from 2 am to 3 am, 9 am to 10 am, 4 pm to 5 pm, 11 pm to 0 pm, is the moon, was dominated by the goddess of the night, so, the diviner of the goddess of the night, You can do 'Magic Mirror Divination' during these time periods on Sunday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foundation is solid... Klein uses the half-covering of the conference room to cover the door. Nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that in the case of the balance of the seven churches, some mysterious knowledge is indeed leaked. For example, the Astrology Handbook provides many symbolic meanings. However, there is no potion, and without extraordinary power, ordinary people can hardly get the desired effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Secondly, we carefully wipe the mirror, it must be a silver-plated mirror, and place it at home to symbolize the position of the moon..." Conduct a demonstration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this time you need the "spirit method", first choose a position, meditation seven times in your heart "here is suitable for magic mirror divination", then look at the pendant The direction of rotation, clockwise is correct, counterclockwise is wrong... Of course, if you pray to a malicious, unknown, mysterious existence, the position is not the key, and he is not interested in the focus... Klein silent Correct the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he has the feeling that he is a teacher of the class...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hainas. Fansent couldn't hear Klein's heart, and the tone of the normal preparation of the ex ante. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“After finishing the bath, make sure that the curtains are all pulled together, and the door is locked tightly. Then, place a candle and put it in front of the mirror. Piously pray to the god of your faith. The problem is as simple as possible. Don’t use complicated decoration...Pray for After seven times, pick up your mirror and drop it on the ground. It must be very light... Remember the broken look. This is the revelation given by the gods... I will talk about several major symbols in detail." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call, this is the orthodox "magic mirror divination." Klein breathed a sigh of relief, walked slowly into the conference room, sat in the previous position, and finished the Southville coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called "orthodox" is that you can really get the revelation, but basically can't really interpret it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "extraordinary" in this step, if you get a response, you can see a certain picture directly from the mirror, get clearer information! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the many symbols formed after the break, Henas talked for a long time, until Edward Steve helped the divination, returned to the conference room, he still Not closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t ask Edward what he was doing to divination, what method was used, which was an unwritten rule between the diviners, playing the role of “divination” Of course, he must strictly abide by it unless the other party takes the initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have found that many times our interpretations are too vague and seem to cater to different needs, so that different people can find themselves and themselves from the interpretation. The description." Edward drank the Xibe black tea, whispered, "For example, there are many twists and turns, there are too many difficulties, but in the end will see the dawn, huh, no one knows when the dawn will come, for example, Your journey is not so smooth, but you can definitely arrive alive. Oh, the dead will not come to refute me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no listening from the beginning, he ignores Heiners' "Magic Mirror Divination Course"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"survivor bias." Klein smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general meaning of survivor bias is that many statistics are often only from alive, survivors, neglecting the deceased, and the results will be significantly biased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Russell is really a philosopher." Edward sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein picked up a coffee cup without coffee and pretended to take a sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All afternoon, members were immersed in the astrolabe and magic mirror divination, and occasionally came to find Klein and Edward to discuss. At this time, Klein is doing his part as an informal member of the Night Squad, and is trying to guide them to avoid ideas that may involve extraordinary and dangerous situations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, what he most wanted to do was unsuccessful. Many inquiries came and went, and he did not choose him to help divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I have to take the initiative to 'entertain' next time, come up with a few words 'You are miserable', 'You will have misfortunes recently', 'You have anything Wouldn't it be a smooth word? No, it's not like a diviner..." Thinking of this, Klein couldn't help but shake his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took his cane, stood up and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At half past five, Edward Steve wore a jacket and was waiting to leave the Divination Club and suddenly saw a familiar figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Glacis, long time no see." He smiled and said, I saw this friend with the same hobby wearing a formal dress, hit the black The bow tie has a pair of monocles hanging from the chest pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he noticed that the other person’s face was quite bad, and even the pale yellow soft hair showed signs of dryness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Edward... cough." Glacis, holding the hat, suddenly pressed his fist against his mouth and coughed a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward cares:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you seem to be sick?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
