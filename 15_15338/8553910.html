			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2000 pounds? This is enough to make all of Beckland's bounty hunters and private detectives crazy! This is no more than the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qi Lingues has been floating on the sea for a long time. It belongs to the next pile and is the type that can be touched when reaching out...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The big pirate with a battle strength ratio of 5, worth 10,000 gold pounds, the murderer of sequence 6 has to open the price of three or four thousand pounds to be reasonable... Is it true that the night punisher’s judgment on the murderer is sequence 7 The "serial killer", not the prospective strongman who is about to promote the sequence 5, so 2000 pounds is a lot of premium...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very likely," The Sun said that the ceremony was quite old. After the Cataclysm, it rarely appeared again. There were no similar materials in the major churches and the military... There was a problem here, the Goddess Church, the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery, and The royal family of the Augustus family can also be said to have risen from the Cataclysm. Without understanding the past, the Storm Church has always insisted that it is one of the oldest... Is it the oldest still after the devil returned to the abyss? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Essinger Stanton’s words, the first thing that Klein’s heart flashed was the assessment of the amount of the reward, and then spread the thoughts, reminiscent of Many things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your opinion?" Essinger sees Sherlock. Moriarty seems to be a bit distracted, and he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My opinion? Klein was a bit embarrassed at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normal private detectives will certainly agree, this is due to the rich rewards, but also the relationship between the famous big detectives - building friendship with Essing, in There will be great benefits in the circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that Klein is not a normal private investigator. He is worried about investigating the clues and encountering the night keeper who is responsible for the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have a beard, glasses, and a haircut, I’ve only seen a few nights, I’m sure I can’t recognize me, but in case What about Ms. Dai Li? Not agreeing is not right, it seems very weird, it is very irritating... And, I also hope to catch the demon earlier, otherwise I don’t know how many innocent girls will be killed... Klein pondered for a few seconds and smiled slightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have just taken over a very troublesome case recently, I am afraid there is no spare time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Not waiting for Essinger Stanton to speak, he added: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can participate in the discussion, help to look through the information, analyze the clues, but should not I will go to the investigation specifically."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then do a divination, if there is a problem, then the discussion will save the speech, as a pure audience... ...where, Klein quickly got the idea of ​​forming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger holding a black cane indulged:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time I have gathered more than a dozen detectives, there are enough people to do the investigation, and what I appreciate most is your excellent reasoning and analysis skills. Without such a lot of resources, I went to the East Byron Dock and went to the dock union."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can catch the criminal, take it down. Bounty, I will distribute the reward reasonably according to the contribution of each person. Believe me, I still have some credibility in this line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, cooperation Pleasant.” Klein took the initiative to reach out and shook hands and felt the dryness and warmth of Essinger’s palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a 40-year-old middle-aged gentleman, it’s not easy to maintain a similar feeling in the late autumn of Beckland, Klein According to this, it is even more doubtful that Essinger is an extraordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Happy cooperation." Essinger nodded with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein discovered that he was somewhat rude and was busy with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sorry, I forgot to invite you in. Let's have a coffee and black tea to have a chat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're welcome, I asked the detectives to arrive at my home at 9am. Discussing the case, my assistant is waiting for them there.” Essinger pulled out a silver pocket watch with a complicated carving and a mechanical beauty. He looked at it and said, “We have to meet them in the past, no problem? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, I went to the bathroom, changed clothes and left." At this moment, Klein suddenly recovered the feeling of fighting crime, maintaining order and protecting the people while doing the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the washroom, Klein went over the fog and got an acceptable answer with divination, so he quickly returned to the real world and put on his coat. Wearing a hat, holding a cane, followed Aisinger on a rental carriage, and sitting around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger looked at him as if he was thinking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very Curious, how did you find that Hibel was killed and the East Byron Dock, related to the Dock Workers Association?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't find it... it was a Misunderstanding... Klein seriously thought about how to weave lies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He replied with a smile, quite vaguely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mainly judge first Bell's death stems from the imitation of crime, thanks to the help of Mike Joseph's reporter, confirming this, and according to the route that Hibel returns to 'Golden Rose', and some other clues, I have the corresponding Guess, so I pretend to be a reporter to investigate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger tapped his head and didn't waste time on this topic, instead introducing the serial killings in detail This situation is more detailed than the one described in the newspaper, especially the latest one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time flies quickly in discussions and exchanges, and the carriage arrives at a slightly older building in the Hillston area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lighting of this house is not very good, even if Beckland is not foggy today, it looks quite dark, Essinger Stanton leads the gram Ryan, through the fairly spacious living room, entered the living room where the fireplace had been lit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked around and saw fifteen or six detectives, who were filled with every seat in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock?" A pleasant voice sounded and seemed to be familiar with Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who? Klein looked at the past with a slight sigh, and found that the Stuart Detective who was only yesterday was actually here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully looked back and identified the Detective Kaslana and her assistant Lidia who had previously been responsible for protecting Atru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a coincidence." Klein upturned his mouth and smiled close to Stuart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart squeezed to the side, vacated the seat of half an ass and patted it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe it's no coincidence, I have read a magazine before, there is a phenomenon in psychology called synchronic, thoughts will happen, haha, joking."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Essinger introduced to the detectives in the room:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Mr. Sherlock Moratti , an excellent detective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his endorsement, Kaslana and others looked at Klein’s eyes with a little more trust. Think that he is indeed a good private detective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Klein’s dagger response, he sat next to Stuart and asked casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Your commission is over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the situation in Atru is getting better, and those bad friends seem to have problems, no longer threatening He, therefore, we are unemployed.” Stuart haha ​​smiled. “I originally wanted to rest for a few days. I ended up with Mr. Stanton’s call, so I came over and sneaked. In fact, this is good, I really don’t like it. A little bit weird, some scary cases, um, I mean the scary of the ghost story, in comparison, I am more willing to take over the murder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc. The assistant poured a cup of coffee or black tea to each person. After distributing the information, Essinger sat down on the easy chair and pulled out the pipe. He slowly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think you will feel strange to the recent serial killings. Do you have any thoughts? Let's talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; The face is thin, and Stuart, who has less hustle and bustle, raises his hand and preaches: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
