			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bounty...Danizi’s cheek muscles jumped, forcing a smile, pretending that he was not a “flame”, and didn’t care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Elland leaves, he violently turns his body, against German Sparrow:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think we should change a hotel, no, it is best to leave Baiyam as soon as possible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you carry a reward of over 5,000 pounds , then I am not safe where I go! The pirates and adventurers who were at the same level as me will definitely be like a bloody shark, madly coming over! Prey that has the ability to solve and prove that it has a very high reward is always very popular, no less than a treasure! Daniz pressed more screams into his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not agree or disagree, slowly revealing a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are worried about your reward Too high?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz focuses on the key, there is a kind of singer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to avoiding, there are other solutions." Klein said as he walked to the coat rack position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Daniz subconsciously asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took off the half-high silk hat and put it on top of his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Improve my own Sequence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the strength match the bounty... He put on his jacket, twisted his handle and walked out of the suite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upgraded to Sequence 6? Become a "conspirator"? Daniz licked for two seconds, suddenly frowned, rubbing his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When taking the sequence 9 "Hunter" and the sequence 8 "Provocate" potion, he did not feel that there was a big problem, and even began to find that he could find the legend Among the big treasures, I got the medium-high sequence formula and the corresponding materials, and I was promoted to the semi-god and became the new king in the sea. But the "arsonist" potion brought him strong pain and bad feelings, which made him afraid and let him fear. I can't believe that I usually follow the instructions of the captain, and I will continue to provoke my opponent's self. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Daniz have to think about whether it was enough to get into the house and then return to Intis to be a rich man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood there, embarrassed for a few minutes, finally wanted to understand a question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even I want to take the potion promotion, and I can't do it in a short time. Because I have to collect recipes and materials, this is not an easy task, and the new reward may be released tomorrow, even today! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, still have to change the hotel and leave Baiam as soon as possible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the Ralph trading firm, Alger seems serious In fact, he casually found a few places to inquire about the news, and received new information from the Storm Church near noon:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Confirmed posting on the door of the church It is the 'flame' Daniz.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be aware of his whereabouts. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flame" Daniz... Alger took the note in his hand and chewed the name silently, his mouth curled up a little, and there was no more in his heart. There is no doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is confident and confident in the boat sailing and hunting materials.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this will happen at sea, because Mr. "The Fool" has a new identity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poseidon"!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I missed the Blue Star in the morning, Daniz waited until 4 pm before starting趁German Sparo went out and tried to hold the “Linging Ceremony.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is more proficient in depicting the sacred emblem of "the god of knowledge and wisdom" - an omniscient eye on a book that has been laid out, and the corresponding altar is arranged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wall of spirituality, he lit the candle, picked up the pure dew extracted from lavender and mint, and dripped it on the silent burning flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fresh and pleasant fragrance is filled, and Daniz has burned several kinds of herbal powder continuously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, he took a step back and used the ancient Hermes language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I pray for the power of knowledge;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for the power of reason;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for wisdom God's patronage;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray that you will let me with the 'teacher of knowledge, the researcher of the spiritual world, the iceberg lieutenant above the sea, from The spiritual communication of Edwina Edwards of Rumburg. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; With the reverberation of the mantra, the altar suddenly became cold, except for the three candles, the remaining brass shrine, the salt plate, the pure dew, the paper pen all floated up and floated in the air.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz waited nervously, not knowing what would happen next.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty In a few seconds, the fire of the three candles swayed and dyed with pale pale green!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz’s body suddenly became stiff and was cold The chill of the monks was forcibly invaded and completely irresistible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw his feet uncontrollably and took a step forward.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw his left hand lifted up and grabbed the black pen and whitish paper.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw himself Low back, holding the pen on the left palm, writing quickly:<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words are full of exquisite words, very artistic, and very different from Daniz's own style.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, Daniz discovered that he could control his head and control his throat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, 'Poseidon' Cavitowa died ! "He squeezed out a rather dull voice, like a bad cold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Details. His left hand wrote fluently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz and so on is the opportunity to immediately describe the matter through the original book, including German Spar In order to complete the adventure of an adventurer, Luo went to the island of Simim, including the curse of the other party suspected of encountering "Poseidon", but it was easy to solve after closing the door, including the madman guessing mistakes, mistakenly regard the remains of the ancient elves as the remains of "Poseidon" At the end of the game, Daniz quickly added his own judgment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think' Above the blood will not come to Baiam for a long time, most of the famous pirates will not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least half a year, the impact of this matter will be calmed down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, You and Galen Sparo's hunting plan may have to be put on hold for a while, I, I want to go back to the 'Golden Dream'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His left hand stagnated for a few seconds before he wrote:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You continue to follow Geer Man Sparrow, as the liaison between me and him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, you, you can teach him ‘falling ceremony’! Deniz shouted snoring.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His left hand brush wrote:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It can only communicate within 500 nautical miles, and as far as the ceremony is concerned, it will take considerable risks, and you have control points on our different islands. This is something that cannot be told to outsiders. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed...German Sparo is just an outsider...but, Captain, I really want to go back to the "Golden Dream"! Daniz racked his brains and said: "But maybe, you can invite him to the ship, no, this..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Daniz’s flash of light: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, he has a messenger! He has a messenger!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The messenger who shuttles to the spiritual world and sends him a letter! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be an unrestricted contact, and more secretive and safer! I don't need to be a contact again! Daniz is very happy I thought.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His left hand hovered for a few seconds and wrote:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If that’s the case, That's no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The New Year holiday is coming to an end, and you really should return to the ship. You have a certain talent in language, but there are still some problems in other areas. I need to work harder to learn more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz opened his mouth and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt that returning to the "Golden Dream" was not something that was too much to look forward to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evening, Klein returned to the "Azure Wind" hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rush of the day did not allow him to find the right target, because the previous investigations, many pirates and adventurers carrying the case were arrested, The rest of the people are still cautiously hiding, not willing to go out at random, whether it is a bar, a casino, or a brothel, there is currently a sluggish business and few customers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's like this." Daniz greeted him, cleared his throat, and said with a smile, "I used the 'death ceremony' for the first time. I have no idea, so I tried it in advance, haha, I succeeded. I passed the captain’s ditch. She also thought that there was no chance to hunt 'blood tops' recently, and I am going to call me back to the 'Golden Dreams'. As for the contact information. Do you have a messenger? You can ask the messenger to send a letter to the captain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My messenger was sent by David, not mine...and the messenger can only Passing the message back and forth between the owner and the token holder does not involve other people. Well, it can be between the ritual user and the owner... This reminds me that I have to find a way to get my own messenger. Otherwise, many things will be inconvenient... As for the method, of course, I am writing to ask Mr. Azick. He must be an expert in this area... Klein pulled the chair without hesitation, sat down and leaned forward. The voice is low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell Captain, I have a way to find 'blood on the top'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Daniz was there, didn't expect to wait for this. Reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he saw that Greman Spalo opened his mouth a little bit and repeated:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Tell your captain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Danizi shuddered, afraid to ask, forcibly laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This will have to wait for the next blue star, which is 11 to 0 tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Klein praised with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deniz is not happy at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slowly stood up and recalled a special food that he had today for dinner, and went to the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of food is called "Teyativa", translated into Ron is "the meat in the fruit" - the chef takes a giant of local specialties The fruit "Tiana", hollowed out its flesh, leaving only a solid outer shell, and then stuffed the mashed lamb and fish into it, accompanied by sea salt and several spices, repeatedly baked on the fire, fleshy It is delicious, with aromas and a perfect blend of fruity sweetness and sourness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closing the door, Klein first wrote a letter, thanked Mr. Azick for his previous guidance, and then asked again how to have his own messenger. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
