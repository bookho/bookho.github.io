			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you summarize the rest of the "Magician Code"? Klein casually flipped through the newspapers he had read, while thinking about issues that were crucial to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has considered a bit before, that is, the difference between "there is no audience cheering", but it seems that this is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, Klein’s thoughts quickly diverge and inexplicably associate with something:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of the "divination" stage, I was recognized by others and praised as a true diviner. It will give me a feeling that the potion will digest faster. After summing up the "Divination Code", I began to think that this There is no direct connection. The opinions and feedbacks of others are only performance, not substance. If they are played well enough, they will naturally be recognized and will naturally speed up digestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, I have always believed that the two are different performances, not causal relationships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, there is the "option" of "the audience applauding"... If it really helps me digest the potion, does it show that some play really needs Feedback, other people's views also subtly affect the progress of my digestive potion? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount, by extension, seven orthodox gods to establish churches, spread faith, and cultivate believers, are there also factors in this regard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......This is really awkward thought, I am really not a person who worships the gods from the heart, I will praise, but I will not be mad... Klein hastened Adjust your thinking and find other entry points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repeatedly compared the subtle differences between "the diviner", "the clown" and the "magician", and gradually got an idea:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In comparison, does the "magician" who needs "performance" contain the meaning of "active"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actively looking for opportunities to perform, not as passive as "Divination" and "Clown"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of fate, this is also consistent, from the "divination of the divination" to the fate, to the "clown" being teased by fate, but still have to keep a smile, Then go to the "magician" to actively challenge the fate, even if it only gets false results, just rely on the blind to get the audience's applause...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slightly invisible nod, I am going to try and take the initiative to do a performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do you start? Things that are relatively less dangerous, the amount, the vampire called Emlin White, who was imprisoned by Father Utlavsky can be considered...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the premise is that I have to confirm that this group of non-humans has always been law-abiding, at most a little thief... Where is Emlin's companion living in the southern part of the bridge? I can't remember it, wait for the divination to think back, um, by the way, confirm the danger level...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking here, Klein puts down the newspaper and gets up and goes upstairs. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that there is no other motivation to actively blend a thing that has little to do with itself, not his character, but to play, he can only force himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still quite simple, what should I do if the steel straight man plays "Witch" or "Happy Witch"? It’s no wonder that Silver City wants to emphasize that "you are just playing"... Klein suddenly understood some of the words of caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver City, a dimly lit room at the top of the round tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief of the "six-member council", Colin Iliad is standing in front of the window, staring at the silver city under the darkness and lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light that illuminates his white, messy hair, reveals the old scars on his face or twisted or smashed, showing his deep The decree is full of worries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Colin turned around and looked at the dark corner, and asked in a deep voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the discovery?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner, a shadow stood up, projecting darkly onto the wall, and twisted, wandering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its voice is rubbed with metal, it is quite harsh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Derek Berg returned to his home and showed some abnormalities , but there is no need to deal with it immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin gently sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What did he do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the magical item at the bottom of the round tower, the avatar is light, and after solving the runaway and the mysterious person who is not the body, he has been I suspect that things have not been completely resolved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former exploration team leader suddenly lost control, the mysterious person forbeares for forty-two years, but recklessly launched the action, without considering the traps and consequences... All of Colin's instinct to kill a lot of monsters feels wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he thinks this is a deliberate choice made by mysterious people. Although the real purpose of the other party is temporarily unknown, there must be corresponding follow-up measures. Simple is cleared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After using the "Hunter" ability to find no abnormalities, he deliberately pretended to be blinded and directly sent the one called Dairik Berg. When the teenager went home, he secretly sent people to conduct close monitoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is completely different from the previous treatment of the detention check, which Colin had to make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shadow that swayed slightly and replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He entered the room and sat down At the bedside, I whispered to myself for a while, because I was worried that it was discovered by the mysterious person. I didn’t get too close, I didn’t hear what I said, but I can confirm that this is an abnormal performance.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the words, Deric seemed to be very tired, and soon fell asleep, but after a long sleep, he suddenly woke up and held a ceremony. I suspect that he is not awake at this time, and is in a state controlled by the mysterious person.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the ceremony has a secret element."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin’s expression thought calmly for a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sure enough... maybe he is passing this way Communicate with his ontology."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What purpose does he have? Why is he comfortable at the bottom of the round tower for forty-two years?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;Black Shadow naturally can't answer this question, continue to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the ceremony, Dairik did not have any abnormal performance?<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you need to deal with this matter immediately? If the body of the mysterious person is attracted, we may not be able to deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The Sixth Board of Directors Colin was silenced for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Continue to observe. The mysterious person has not yet shown substantial enough Malicious, our response can't be too intense.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, do you remember that prophecy? It’s almost time for the disaster to come... We are exploring more and more Far, more and more weird remains are found, and the things that are harvested are getting more and more dangerous..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow your will, chief lord." The black shadow slowly retracted to the ground and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Berg family, Dairik suddenly coughed up, coughing the heart seems to be cracked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough and cough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squats down and coughs until the throat itches and coughs up something! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, a translucent thing slipped through his throat and fell to the ground, the size of the finger and the size of the bug! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has some completely transparent places that form a circle of rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick had seen something similar at the bottom of the round tower to fully affirm that he had got rid of the influence of Amon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
