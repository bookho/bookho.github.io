			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, the ancient temple-style buildings stand quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the unexpected coincidence of some unusual Klein, I entered this mysterious space after lunch, trying to confirm some guess in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the pen with a rounded pen, and paused for two seconds and wrote:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I was involved in a series of coincidences made by the seal '0-08'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the dark red pen, Klein left holding the silver chain Divination was carried out step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, he opened his eyes and looked at the spirit that was close at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citrine pendant is still, without rotation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This indicates that the divination failed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be insufficient conditions to be able to divinate, or it may be a "0-08" confrontation... Both cases will have similar results... Klein After changing the different sentences and pointing to different goals, the divination eventually failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fingers tapped the edge of the mottled long table, hesitating whether he would go to the Red Rose Manor the day after tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is really no "0-08" or similar power to arrange these things, then I suddenly flee, will definitely cause Prince Edsack to doubt, no, abscond It may not be successful, the Prince Edsac’s people live next door... Of course, it’s already a “no-face-to-face” person. It’s easy to find a chance to escape when I’m out, but it’s necessary to get this level. ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next afternoon, honestly meet Prince Edsac and hand over the task, you can "leave" Beckland without his eye-catching, and he A prince should not force me to be a wild extraordinary person to do too difficult things...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a seal like "0-08" Things or demigods are affecting recent events. From my experience, I should only be a supporting role that has entered the stage. I have not received enough attention. In this case, absconding is equivalent to telling the other party. I have noticed that The existence of you"! I have a big problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the ability to rely on "no face" may not be able to get rid of the "gaze" that locks me...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way is to go to Red Rose Manor calmly, exit the stage with the most normal process, and make a decent curtain call, fade out the "line of sight" from where I don't know...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Integrating the two elements, Klein finally decided to pretend that nothing was discovered, and handed over the task according to the scheduled plan, "leaving" Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burning in flames, always in the open-air camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick. Berg is backed by a stone pillar and falls asleep to restore strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he dreamed of the boundless gray mist, dreamed of an ancient chair at the highest center, and sitting on a chair. Looking down at all the indifferent figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. "The Fool"..." Dairik shouted the name in a mournful way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he heard the voice from "The Fool":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare for the party." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Mr. "The Fool". Dairik silently responded and counted the heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes never open, just like everything that happened just a dream interlude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a long time to go, enough to attend the Tarot gathering... He was quite fortunate to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally thought that he would miss this party when he entered the exploration team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 1000 heartbeats, Derick waited a little longer before he felt that he had entered the quiet and peaceful temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just opened his eyes, and his mind suddenly flashed back and forth through scenes, just like the external force instantly re-infused all the lost memories into his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These scenes include: collapsed walls; white-blue interlaced buildings; the "fallen creator" temple similar to the silver city style; details the end of the scene and "The Fallen Creator" resists the six evil spirits, and blesses the murals of human beings; the beautiful and dangerous "mushroom"; I don't know where it comes from, the unusually pale yellow-haired boy Jack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene is repeated over and over again, five times, but each time there are some differences in detail:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time, outside the fallen creator temple, all the animal skin lanterns were all extinguished, almost causing tragedy. For the second time, some people could not control themselves, almost swallowed "mushrooms", but fortunately the chief section Lin stopped in time. For the third time, the little boy Jacko told a piece of content that he and his father were chasing the sanctuary of the creator in the ocean without seeing the margin. The result was a huge storm, for the fourth time. Joshua was seriously injured by Jack, a boy who had no signs of change. For the fifth time, the temple collapsed completely and blocked the exit of the underground area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every time, the "Hunter" Colin kills the little boy Jack as the ending, to rest in the camp, ready to enter the ruin city as the beginning, the first and the last Connected, repeated cycles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have explored five temples...we have been living in this experience and there is no way to really end it! The more Dairik understands the memory that he suddenly has, the more he feels terrified and the more creepy he is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the bronze long table, "Justice" Audrey originally wanted to say hello to the "Folly" and everyone, as usual, but Her eyes swept away and immediately found that the little "sun" was not right. She immediately asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Sun, what happened? Explore the truth, Amount, the action of the fallen creator temple is not smooth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Sun" Dairik is like grabbing the hope and quickly describing the passage of things. Once again, the last words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the little boy was cleared by the 'Chief', we closed our eyes and then woke up in the camp outside the city. Ready to start a new exploration, no more memories.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This process is repeated five times, only slightly different in details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it wasn't for Mr. Fool's reminder, I don't even know that I have been repeating my life during this time."<br /><br />&nbsp ;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He naturally believes that the memory that came out of the fog came from the reminder of Mr. Fool, so he stood up and solemnly bowed to the vague figure sitting at the top of the bronze long table. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still listen to your description and understand what happened... "Foolish" Klein has been awkward since now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He maintains his original posture and gently daggers in response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the cause of the problem, the superior can't easily express his position, and can't rashly speak... Klein secretly reviewed the knowledge of the keyboard when he was a senior. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See "Difficult" Mr. seems to have no deep waves of ancient wells, "Sun" Dairik has a lot of peace of mind, I feel that things can be resolved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to "downside down", "world", "justice" and "magician" and asked sincerely:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know the root of the problem? How to solve it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enthusiastic "justice" Audrey instinct I have to answer, but I find that I don’t have a clue. I can’t even guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Magic" Firth is similar to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has a wealth of insights from the earth, and has seen many novels that stay on the same day type. I wanted to manipulate the "world" to give ideas. Everyone got the inspiration for thinking, but after thinking about it, they chose a low-key and prepared to observe first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger listened to the description of "the sun" and silenced for a while, at this time discretion: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
