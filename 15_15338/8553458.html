For her, this place is not only full of wine and sweat, but also easy to touch. To a person who is much taller than her, she has to face the side of her knees, and the rich flavor can really stun the normal person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took a lot of effort and even the ability to use the "arbitrator". Hugh finally squeezed into the bar and saw the person he was looking for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a young man in his twenties. His face is long and thin, his eyebrows are fierce and fierce, and his facial features are relatively soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is drinking heavily, and he laughs loudly with the guests around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Williams, I have something to look for you." Hughly knocked down the wooden table of the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rude action suddenly attracted a glaring gaze, but they quickly retreated in the harsh view of the "arbitrator." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Hugh, I haven't seen you for many days, I think, this is a week, no, at least three weeks, do you want a cup?" Half and half '?' The young man named Williams said half-intoxicated and half-amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Half-and-half" is the most popular alcoholic beverage in the Eastern District, made from malt beer and alcohol-enhanced wine, because it is just two ingredients, the ratio is also Almost, so nicknamed "half and half". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really want me to drink?" Hugh picked up his eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, he doesn't want to!" The boss who wiped the glass in the bar hurriedly answered for Williams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly remembers how much damage the girl will face after being drunk, and she will use her fists to persuade the guests here to stop drinking and put them one by one. throw it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams licked his mouth and spread the handkerchief:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say, you What are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is one of the sources in the Eastern District and has connections with several gangs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happled and frowned: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Williams, can't you stop drinking? Good money, a good girl, hot water, dishes and warm greetings every day, you can share with me the things you see, she tells you about the trivial things happening at home, Have a cute child kiss your cheek and play around you, is this kind of warmth not good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she first arrived at Bakerland, she could quickly The East is based on the help of Williams, so she always hopes that the other party can live better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warm?" Williams snorted. "That was built on the money I brought back. I have already seen it if I am weekly. I can take home 20 Sule, then I am sure that my family is warm, as you described it, but if not, Lord, woman screams and insults, children crying and shouting, will drive me crazy !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My mother is a role model. Every time my old man goes home, he is accompanied by snoring and noisy. In this case, I might as well use the soler and pennies on my body to drink alcohol. No one cares how much I earn here. Everyone drinks and chats. The atmosphere is very, very good. If you want a woman, there are those cute street girls outside, they won’t be noisy with you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower corner of the mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a hopeless believer in the storm, you will one day die of alcohol and some strange diseases." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least I have already enjoyed it." Williams answered without hesitation. "I haven't started working for three days. I won't give you a discount." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh no longer persuaded, touched the messy short blond hair, handed over the portraits of Aurora to Aurora:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me to pay attention to this person and find him as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is him here. The image."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams drunk the paper, took a few glances and said: "He looks too ordinary, and the people in the Eastern District are so There are many people, people are dead at any time, some people leave, some people come, some people become tramps, it is hard to find."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In short, you pay attention to me, Someone who found similarity immediately informed me." Hume took 5 Sule's banknotes and handed it to the other party. "This is money, if you can find the person on the portrait, I, the amount, give you another 10 pounds."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"10 pounds?" Williams whistle, "Hugh, when are you so generous? Or is this person worth more?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His reward is like this, providing clues of 10 pounds." On vacation, I replied in the environment of the pub, "You don't forget this thing, I will come back to you every few days." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has ran a small half of the Eastern District and issued this to the gangsters and informed sources who they know. Task, paid out several pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as there is a success, I can earn it back and earn a lot! Hume silently sighed at himself, covered his mouth and nose, and turned to go outside the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, some of the drunken quarrels became conflicts, and the scene gradually became chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughly glanced at the glance and raised the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of majesty reverberated in the pub, the drunks are like a nemesis, busy sitting down again, and some even hold their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, I don’t know when I can be promoted to “Sheriff”... I’m half satisfied and half sighed with anticipation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday morning, Klein went far away as if in another The city of St. George, cares about its first investment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his last mention and the revelation of the Russell manuscript, Reppard’s progress on the bicycle project is very fast, and a car has been made. Rough prototype. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very consistent with the bikes in Klein’s impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the test ride, Klein provided several improvements, saying that he will pay for the second part of the investment next week and hopes to introduce new investment as soon as possible. People, let this project enter the factory stage as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is that Repard thinks he is the inventor and has the right to name the product. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is dissatisfied with the term "bicycle" and intends to adopt a more popular "bicycle". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, after returning to No. 15 Minsk Street, he still had the hat to be picked up in the future, and he heard the pray of Unreal cascading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missing "Justice"? So quickly collected the information of the broken aristocracy? Klein thoughtfully prepared to enter the living room and head to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, he heard the sound of the doorbell, turned back and opened the door, and saw Julian, the maid of the Samuel family next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moriarty, Mrs. Summer, would like to invite you to a luncheon on Sunday, when there will be many neighbors." The maid recited Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning last night, Klein gave the portable camera to Mrs. Summer, and exchanged a few words with the other party, but did not get a hint of the luncheon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the magazine said that the middle class invites people to feast not to mention in person, they are very formal to send a waiter or a maid to invite ... this is very consistent with Sa Mrs. Merle’s work... Klein was first confused, and immediately realized that she would go on time on Sunday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a free lunch, who is not happy? And Mr. Summer and his wife are not too difficult to get along with, as long as they can not care about their show... Klein quietly added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing the maid Julian leave, he closed the door and walked to the stairway, sweeping through the slightly messy living room, dining room and kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven’t done a lot of cleaning in a few days... I’m a bachelor, it’s good to maintain this level of neatness... I’m too secret, maybe I will be attacked. It is not very good to ask a miscellaneous maid to live at home. It is not as good as discussing with Mrs. Summer on Sunday. Let her send her maid to clean twice a week. I will pay the corresponding compensation... Many tenants and landlords have similar agreements... Kline’s pace is steady, and he enters the bedroom on the second floor unhurriedly and slowly, and draws up the curtains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the fog, he found that the prayer really came from Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocratic girl sits on the piano bench and presses the keys with both hands, but does not play, but whispers "the fool who does not belong to this era" The name of the name:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I collected the information of the fallen aristocrats and requested a sacrificial ceremony. Please forward it to Mr. 'World'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurry...not a "professional"... Klein immediately responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning from the royal coat of arms officials and experts who studied this aspect, Audrey slightly completed the sacrifice ceremony and lost the thick manuscript. Into the illusory door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will hand it over to the 'world.'" Kline's tone indifference cut off the connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he was not eager to return to the real world, but turned the manuscript on the spot and found the part of the Pound family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pound House’s viscounts really came from the “war of swearing,” and they were followed by loyal royals, with a small force in the army and in their own land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thirty-two years ago, the family had two heirs in succession and died of serious illness. At that time, the old viscount could only receive a child from the side branch. Home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for the old viscount to die. The child changed his housekeeper and became awkward because of his age and temptation and teaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just seven or eight years of work, he lost most of his property and was reduced to a baron, and even his family’s house in Bakerland was sold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few years, his title was once again reduced, leaving only the Baron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Infected with serious illness and died? I am afraid that even the body can not be found, are in the innermost room of the underground building, outside the bloody door... ... The old prince must have intentionally concealed this matter, did not let the royal family, the military and the church investigate... It seems that the Pound family only accidentally discovered the Quaternary underground building more than 30 years ago, maybe Perhaps the secret door of the basement was built by them...but there are more than two bodies in the innermost room... In the old age, have anyone gone in and explored?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I have to find Pound to talk from the baron, in a way that does not reveal my identity...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stopped thinking and looked forward to it. In the last paragraph, I saw what I wanted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pound from the Baron, now rented at 29 West Vilas Street, Queens. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
