			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Hearing Dunn's proposal, Leonard replied easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he and Klein and others walked out of the warehouse, near the monster Bieber "self-destruction", as the center of the circle, circled outward search. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, what are we looking for?" Klein looked at the scattered rotten flesh and blood, forcibly resisted the nausea, and looked at Deng, who was beside him. En. Smith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down didn’t look up, still glanced at the ground with deep ashes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Losing control and becoming a monster means that Riel Bieber does not fully absorb the extraordinary power provided by the notes, which also indicates that a certain part of his body will be enriched and become a higher quality material." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you encounter a similar situation in the future, don't miss it, it may be a very important 'item'."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way... Klein nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, he thought of another thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the monster is richer than Bo The part of extraordinary strength is some unspeakable place, so it is not very embarrassing... It is not very disgusting to use it later...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Ryan’s thoughts diverged, his eyes sharpened like the eagle’s Borgia suddenly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Found, cough.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn and Ayr immediately turned around and moved closer, and Klein was driven by curiosity and quickly moved to Borgia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he saw something in front of Borgia, it was a gray-sized thing with a fist-sized head, covered with gullies, and overall soft and quality. It is like a brain taken out of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Klein can't see the extraordinary "grey" for the time being, it is only from the other side that it can be intact in a violent explosion. Ergia did not find the wrong item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun looked at it carefully, squatted, bent his right arm, and carefully grabbed the gray thing with his left hand with black gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just touched, the group "gray" immediately spread out and became a sticky liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Al-Hassen took out a tin-colored square box from his arms and took out the cigarette inside and put it in his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he handed the square iron box to Dunn and smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I know, you only love pipes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den "had", took the square iron box and put the gray, sticky liquid " Fill it into it and store it temporarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receiving this item, he and Luo Luota and others roughly searched the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there were not too many omissions, they left here and went outside, seeing the horses were irritatingly slamming the ground and almost broke off the ropes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will drive." Borgia held her hand and coughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, you will comfort the animals." Ayr smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the carriage, Dunn, Lorotta, Al-Hassen and Klein, who kept the "flexion and extension", were silent and silent. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the horseshoes slammed and the wheels rolled, Dunn looked at Klein and thought about the opening:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that you are curious about the notes of the Antignus family and want to figure out what happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not at all... Klein subconsciously denied in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an ancient item full of misfortunes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t give him a reply, Dunn said from his own feet:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must first report this matter to the church, and wait until they confirm the confidentiality level of the notes before they can be considered for viewing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem. Klein replied briefly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng Enku stretched his arm and thought about it again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promised, Waiting to confirm that Riel Bieber is a descendant of the Antigonus family, let you become a full member of the night actor. Now, we not only affirm the identity of Riel Bieber, but also destroy this monster, frustrated The conspiracy of the secret society."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this process, you performed very well and personally killed a member of an evil organization, so I will To fulfill the promise, immediately apply to the church and wait for their approval."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I forgot an important thing, I have not asked if you are willing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Klein Moretti, are you willing to formally join the Tingen City Night Squad and become a member of us? Your salary will be turned immediately Times, to the extent of 6 pounds per week, and then there will be a certain degree of growth each year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your salary will be The church and the Ahowah County Police Department each bear half of it, and you will also receive the status of a trainee inspector. At some point, this will be very useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As For the extraordinary person, you don’t have to face the enemy all the time, but you need to take a day to check out the door..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without the approval of the team, you You can't leave Tingen with any excuse and try to keep your family secret..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Dunn finished the restrictions and benefits, Klein pondered for more than a dozen seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope to be a formal night keeper."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way is that you can get more exposure to the secrets, such as the case of the Secret Service! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- After seeing the Russell Diary collected before, Klein improved some of his ideas: mastered occult knowledge, found home The way is his constant pursuit, and further improve his own strength, in order to safely incite the mysterious space above the fog, and thus return to his hometown with it, is the newly added goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Russell’s words, it’s very dangerous to rely solely on external forces! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, becoming a "divinationist", after gaining extraordinary power, Klein also realized that he had a better grasp of the mysterious space, for example, can Pull a member to join the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has to make him think, after he becomes the extraordinary person of sequence 8, sequence 7, or even higher sequence, above the fog Whether the mysterious space will have more favorable changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Klein is very clear that the premise of all is that he must completely solve the hidden dangers of the "Divination" potion first, can not be anxious, can not be reckless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, wait for the church to be approved, you are one of us." Dunn's ashes got a little smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Al Hasson, who has been listening, interjected: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ryan, I call you Klein. Your performance today is really good. You can kill a peculiar person in a secret society. I suspect that he has reached the sequence of 7. How did you do it? I can’t Believe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem really came... Klein was prepared to make an organizational language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that killing an extraordinary person who can simultaneously deal with Dunn, Ayr, and Lorotta is incredible, full of mystery, Ayre, they only have eyes Nothing, my head is not stupid, I will ask about it sooner or later, but what he did not expect is that they have to endure it until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
