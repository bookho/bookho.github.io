With the help of the wind, he quickly ran to the body of Grosser. Next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bent down, carefully watched for a while, then pushed the other side, shouting screamingly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Wake up! Wake up!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We should go out! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is getting weaker and slower.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobette stands by, watching When the giant's body swayed, it was difficult to maintain balance, and finally fell to the ground with a splash.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quietly spivered for a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Anderson and Edwina have run to the frozen monk Snoman, a flame, a simulated light, to help each other quickly Thawed, only Klein came directly to Grosell because he was nearby.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His "spiritual line" visually told him that the other party had died Only the spirit still survives, but it also begins to dissipate, which makes his ability to transfer damage not work at all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the burning dawn, the second time When the Frost Dragon is entangled, Grosseel should be ready for death... Klein is silent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobett has taken aim At first glance, I smiled bitterly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frankly speaking, there are not many giants I have seen, most of which come from books, teachers and parents. I think this race is cruel and violent, closer to monsters than to wise creatures, but Grosell is not like this. He is frank, honest, and optimistic. Although it looks a bit silly, it is more than anyone who knows what is right and what is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He told me that this is because he is not the oldest giant, not even the second generation third generation... the cruel and mad giants are the same The instinct to have mating will give birth to future generations, and from time to time there will be more sensible types, and these descendants will breed and progeny, making the whole giant family more and more out of the category of monsters.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I don't know if I should believe him, but his existence proves such a possibility..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobett Speaking and talking, suddenly stopped, seems to have fallen into memories of the past.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Edwina and Anderson support the body and have obvious stiffness When Snowman came closer, the bitter monk struggled and walked to the side of Grosser.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the closed vertical eye, Snorman painted a cross-like symbol on his chest, half closed his eyes and whispered a prayer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Father of things, great roots, there is an honest and pure spirit here... May he enter your country and receive eternal salvation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer Tass opened his mouth and seemed to say that Grosseel believed in the giant King Ormill, but in the end he did not speak and silently watched Snoman complete the prayer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"We must go out as soon as possible, no one knows how long the door will last! "The elf singer looked around for a circle, because of sadness and pain, she looked quite violent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked down at the giant and looked down道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can't let Grosell's spirit dissipate in this illusory world, we must let him return to reality! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Mobett immediately agreed that Klein and others had no objection.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina turned her head and shouted at the cave with ice and snow: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Daniz, you can come out. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Xia Tashi's eyes turned slightly and seemed to think of something. He looked at Klein on the side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a pen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Klein took out the water-absorbing pen and sticky note paper that he carried with him. This is a professional quality of the "Divination". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiatas took over and brushed and began to write until Daniz ran out of the cave, still not stopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi is silent and does not speak, the mood seems to be quite low, and there is no obvious joy and excitement because he is about to leave the world of books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Shatass stopped writing and returned the paper and pen to Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The recipe you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not going out to trade? Klein was puzzled and silent, taking over his pen and the "Sea Singer" potion recipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have noticed his incomprehensibility, and Shatasta turned his head and looked at Grosser on the ground, saying low:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are now companions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So can you give the potion recipe directly? Klein collected the items and nodded invisibly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I go out, I will give you the glass."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiatasi did not answer, pushed Mobetter a hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to Grosell."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maubert looked down at his not-so-sturdy body and high-pitched leather boots, but with a wry smile, went to Grosser's thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The disciplinary knight" Longzel silently followed, bending over and holding the giant's left shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson looked around and snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You hurt, Weak weak, or let me come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately hugged the shoulders of Grossel's other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is about to go to the remaining thigh, Daniz has stepped over and grabbed the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing, he stopped and watched Anderson and others lift Grosser to the unreal door that covered the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, Edwina, and Shatti, who was swaying in the footsteps, silently followed, reaching the frosty dragon Yurisian The exit position of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Klein looked around and found that the pale blue blood that had previously flowed out of the "King of the North" had disappeared and seemed to have never existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, an out-of-the-box, near-real monster... Klein fell behind, watching Edwina step forward, slightly bending over Back, press the palms on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the "Iceberger Lieutenant" violently pushed the door that covered the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, everything that everyone saw became illusory, and immediately became transparent and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a row of brown-yellow bookshelves that appeared in front of them, showing the orange sun that had fallen to the sea level outside the window, and a pendulum appeared. A table with pens, ink bottles and paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the captain's room of "Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quickly turned their attention to the center of the table, where there was a book of yellow-brown parchment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book was flipped by the invisible wind and came to the last page, and Klein and others saw the end:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the help of crazy adventurers and powerful hunters, Grosser completed his promise and led his teammates to kill the 'King of the North', but he also slept in the frost Country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing gives us the ending... Shatas, where do you want to go next?" Mobetter put down Grosser's thigh and asked the Elf singer sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiatas’s gaze was fascinated for a few seconds, and he immediately said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My clan..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice did not fall, and suddenly she saw Mobette's linen hair fluttering white and seeing the other's original smooth face appearing obvious Wrinkles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a time of breathing, and Mobetter in her eyes is aging to dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Xia Tashi’s heart was tight, he had to pounce on the past, but he suddenly found his legs had become weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plop, she fell on the floor and found that her back was covered with scars from the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She understood what was going on, the tears in her eyes couldn’t stop falling, and the body struggled, struggling, trying to climb to Mobetter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maubert has also fallen to the ground, also squirming to her, and extending the right palm forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shatas handed his right palm over and took the dry, thin hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They struggled to look up, and the scorpion reflected what the other party is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corners of their mouths are simultaneously swaying upwards, unable to loosen, and the eyelids hang down to cover the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, Edwina, Anderson, and Daniz are totally unresponsive to such changes, and don’t know what they can do, they can only watch Grosell's body rotted quickly, flesh and blood evaporated, leaving only the extraordinary characteristics of bones and precipitates. Watching Mobert, Shatas, Snowman and Longzer dying in a few seconds, then dying, then Lose your breath and repeat everything that happened on Grosser's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their clothing has disappeared or turned into a ash, and their spirits have disappeared at an extraordinary rate, and soon they have not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The shortest person has lived in it for more than 165 years..." Edwina whispered herself and turned to look at that A white bone that looks out over the sea and the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "disciplined knight" Longzel, he sat in the chair, overlooking the west, is the direction of Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snowman sat next to the plate, and the corpse remained in a praying gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, they lived in the world for hundreds of years in the book, for thousands of years, from the rules of the outside world, even the gods are not theirs, early Damn it... I should want to get this question... Why am I not alert? Could it be that... Klein suddenly remembered the spiritual influence of the world in the book on Mobett, Grosell and others, and vaguely judged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again looked down at the book bound into the parchment, and believed that there were many more secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy is very interesting, just died..." Anderson looked at Mobett's body and licked his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, all the extraordinary features are slowly condensing, but "Discipline Knight" Longzel did not reveal something similar, Edwina looked at it for a while In a plain tone, he said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The potion he took is false, and he gains strength, just like the frosty dragon." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be the reality of the world in the book, which is almost true to false... Klein silently sighs, but for a moment he did not know what to say, he had to keep Ger Man. Sparo-style silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next ten minutes, in the captain's room of the "Golden Dream", no one spoke until the four extraordinary characteristics were formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have a fist size, like a heart, covered with holes, shining like morning light, a jellyfish, a transparent outer layer wrapped in azure The sea water, sometimes with the wind rolling up the whirlpool, sometimes flashing silver, and faintly sings a melodious song, a pure and shiny spar, full of sacred feelings, a hand like a baby's palm, small The five fingers open and change the skin color because of the environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
