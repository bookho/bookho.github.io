			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One pocket, two pockets, three pockets... Klein quickly found a bloody wallet, a Deville library The borrowing card, two brass keys hanging together, a pipe without any stuff, a dagger with a sheath, and a few neatly folded letterheads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After putting everything outside the stationery on the side of the ground, he stood up straight and took a look at the wallet, confirming that there were only a dozen Sule Banknotes and a small amount of copper pennies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This wallet work is quite good, but unfortunately..." Klein silently sighed, and his thoughts were somewhat divergent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not too much money spent on private money today, buying a wallet is already on his schedule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shake his head, Klein unfolds the letter, and quickly reads it by browsing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respect Mr. Z: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please allow me to defend myself. It is not foolish for me and Hynas to sell the notes of the Antignus family. It’s not betrayal. It’s not a bit special when we are in our hands.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I suspect it’s alive, suspecting it’s life and wisdom. Evil items are dangerous things that must be sealed.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s not the same in different stages, in front of different people!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, I got confirmation from the lamb inside the police station."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although Everything presented in this note is true enough and there is a lot of supporting support, but I think it will only show up in the hands of the descendants of the Antigonus family." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I and Henas got it, I could only see some trivia of the Antigone family and see the night on the main peak of Hornachs. The general situation of the country, as well as the three serial potions formulated last time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, the secret will hold the 'Divination' The route has a strong ability to track, so both I and Hainas believe that it is very risky to keep the note, and the value it reflects at the time is not enough for us to take the risk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the absence of waiting for your reply, we negotiated and sold the notes to Welch in the same block. He likes to collect artifacts and ancient books. It’s a big price, and then it’s what you know.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is the first thing I want to explain, and I’m writing this line of text. At the time, Henas died, and the cause of death was sudden heart disease in his sleep. This must be the gift of the Lord to him. He avoided the ending in the hands of the infidels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to move to a safe, hidden place, even afraid to go out, fortunately, The lamb told me that Hainas was stared at by the pagans not because of the notes of the Antigonus family, nor because he exposed his identity, but that he stupidly collected a female apprentice and wanted to slowly develop each other into us. a member. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His female apprentice peeked at his secret spell and tried the magical divination in the case of a worthy night pagan gaze, the next Development believes that you can guess, I don't need to describe it again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the identity of the lamb is not high enough to figure out the specific details." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" From various feedbacks, the pagans did not doubt me, and their investigation was interrupted by the timely death of Hainas. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" So, I went back to the street and planned to go to the Devils Library to borrow a few more journals to find more clues. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the same force that has mastered the 'divination' approach, the Antigonus family should have certain expectations for their own destruction, they must leave The secret treasure of reviving! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is enough reason to believe that the treasure is in the main peak of the Hornaces, just somewhere in the ruins of the night country! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Klein's pupils contracted sharply, almost letting the letter paper fall from the hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"The sequence that the Antigonus family has mastered is the 'divination' approach?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really a coincidence!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thunderstorm blew in Kline’s mind, which made him feel confused and fatal: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the original owner die, and the notes that helped me through indirectly came from the Antigonus family who mastered the 'divination' approach, which made me finally choose' The Divination's potion is the diary of Russell's Emperor, and Russell's tendency to the 'Divination' sequence is due to the mysterious Mr. Chalatu, who also masters the 'Divination' approach to the Secret Society leader! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This is like a fate weaving a net of breathlessness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What is hidden behind all this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a letter and took a few steps back and forth, trying to find something else Just now Yung evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the Charat family’s secretive society is chasing and searching for the legacy of the Antignus family...if the two parties belong to the same extraordinary path Look, reason and motivation are sufficient: perhaps the completion of the sequence, perhaps the rare material to get a high sequence of promotion, perhaps the experience of avoiding the loss of control accumulated by the other party..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this way, it is quite reasonable for the Antigonus family to at least master the partial sequence chain of the 'Divination' route."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, when I took the clues of the 'Clown' potion, the pictures that appeared were almost all related to the Antigonus family. The only exception was the Tuxedo clowns of the Secret Society... So the true meaning of those symbols is Every screen is a possibility to get the 'Clown' potion, there is a clue hidden, but I don't understand the key, sorry to miss it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There With proof of these two aspects, Klein almost believed that Sirius mentioned in the letter. Things, but also understand when you hear his voice should not be heard, why always have, "Horner Bridges" is the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first time there was a similar situation, that was when I just finished eating the "Divination" potion!" He said suspiciously in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he speculated that "experienced with the legacy of the Antignus family and still alive" and "the extraordinary person who became the diviner's way" was heard " The two necessary conditions for Hornachs' related whispers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancient ruins of the main peak of Hornachs, is there really a secret treasure hidden by the Antignus family? No, can't think about this! Only that note has killed a bunch of people, the complete treasure will only be more terrible! Klein subconsciously shook his head and turned his attention to the third, the end of the last stationery:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Z, I hope to get your help. I think you should have enough interest in that treasure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before that, I will make myself like a normal person, a normal history lover. "[< /> /> </ br> <br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;"The main humble of Sirius Aripis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the letter of Sirius, Klein suddenly wanted to laugh: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, how come I have saved the feeling of Tingen City? What do you guys want to do? The cult is really unreasonable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Which is Mr. Z, the personality is very high...at least the sequence of the captain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Siris Where is the letter to be sent? He did not write the address... It seems that this is the cautiousness of the cultists, and will not leave the address at the last moment of sending it out..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, since the Antigonus family has mastered some of the 'divination' pathways, the three recipes that Sirius submitted to receive from the Antignus family notes contain 'Clown' potion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most likely!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
