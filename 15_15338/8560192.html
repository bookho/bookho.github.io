			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that I am not too tired. Klein licked her forehead and took a hand to make a metal vial in the debris pile fly over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small tube of blood that he took a lot of effort before extracting from his veins. He has already brought it to the fog, waiting for the spirit. Enter the "Grossel Travels" and explore the opportunities in the world of books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After unscrewing the lid, Klein was not eager to apply blood to the dark brown cover of the book, but to get the Tarot party into this mysterious space. All the items were “summoned” from the heap of debris, scattered in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that the shape of the "Black Emperor" is too eye-catching, without knowing the specific conditions of the world in the book, Klein decided not to carry the sly Card, switch to the Azick copper whistle to strengthen the spirit, so as not to be killed by the inexplicable force, no time to return to the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the integration of the ancient and exquisite copper whistle, Klein’s spirit seems to swell a little, but it is a lot thicker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eye sockets jumped out of two dark flames, they seem to have their own vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With meditation and adjustment of spirituality, Klein converges all the coldness from death into the body, and the abnormality in the eye quickly recovers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the evil spirits show the way ordinary people look and trick the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Klein put on the "squirming hunger" and hid the extraordinary characteristics of the "cancel the clock" revolver and "nightmare", the latter He is looking for an unusual preparation for exploring the dreams of the world's living beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the preparations, he unscrewed the lid of the metal vial, poured out a few drops of blood, and applied it to the cover of Grosser's Travels. on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short wait, what he saw was vague, as if there were countless transparent things, and it became clear, with blue sky, white clouds, and taupe. City walls, there are pedestrians coming and going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the land of ice and snow, but a city that looks normal on the surface... Klein stands on the dirt road and examines the inhabitants of the world in the book. We found that most of them were wearing linen shirts, brown short coats and darker trousers. The overall style was similar to the Kingdom of Lun hundreds of years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at their own swallowtail dress, hard collar shirt and dark red bow tie, Klein silently changed them all, just around with People are no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately went to the city gate, ready to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a goalkeeper wearing a leather armor stopped him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tax! 1 Riddle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you see me as rich? I don't know what Riddle is... Klein smirked in his heart and immediately used the "communication" between the spirit and the spirit to successfully transfer the attention of the goalkeeper to the caravan that entered the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a quasi-resentment that can be manipulated by the other party, the mental effect on the target is normal operation, this ability is not strong, but for ordinary For people, it works. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the city, Klein was alert and relaxed on the streets, feeling that the public health environment was better than Beckland in earlier years. It seems that there is a mature sewer system, and there will be no such things as dumping feces and urine in the upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a false world in the book, everyone has a 'spiritual line'..." Klein looked at it while moving forward. Suddenly, there was a stone building over 10 meters high on the side. It had only two floors, and the top of the gate was almost four meters to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sign next to the building that says something different from the outside world that Klein can understand at a glance:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Psouth Blacksmiths Guild"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blacksmiths’ Guild, it’s not yet in the steam age... Klein Just after feeling, I saw the door open and screamed, and there was a giant with extreme limbs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant's complexion was gray-blue, and the head of the head was marked with a straight, one-eyed eye. He had a big, heavy hammer in his hand, and his mouth went to the other side of the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human beings who are coming and going are not afraid of him, and seem to have seen too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They even greeted the giant:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon, Grosser !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grossel... It’s only to be familiar with the face of the giant’s blinder Klein’s pupils! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was about to catch up, only to find that the giant turned into another street and disappeared into his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stood in the same place, quietly watching the intersection of the two streets, and there was some speculation in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the world of books, there is also a Grosser?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, the end of the travel is the death of Grosser In the country of frost...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this another story?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of doubts In a variety of ways, Klein was not in a hurry to find Grosell and turned into a pub next to the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This place is often the most confusing and complex of a city message, helping him to quickly grasp the overall situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in the pub is dim, the ventilation is not too good, the air is a bit muddy. At this time, there are not many people who come to drink, most of them are at the bar. Location, and each other, and the bartender happily chatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stepped over and his eyes solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the man sitting on the side of the bar wearing a hard hat and wearing an asymmetrical coat. He looks good, has linen hair, dark brown The eyelids, the tall nose and the thin lips are the Mobute Soloyas, the Viscount of the Solomon Empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing him, Klein remembered the "dreaming" fast aging, fell to the ground, and struggled to climb the wizard singer Shatas, holding Live the picture of her palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s all as clear as yesterday, but now Mobett is once again in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein calmed down and walked over to sit next to Mobate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not speak, he knew that Mobett would actively communicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Foreigner, the first time I came to Pesot? I swear, I have not seen you before." Mobetter put down the cup containing distilled spirits. Looking at Klein Road sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am from the country of frost." Klein whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobett suddenly laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really joking, here is the frost Country, of course, that was a matter of many years ago.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the legendary 'King of the North' was killed by some adventurers, no, heroes, There is no snow and ice here, and everyone thinks it should be called the country without winter. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was silent and did not respond.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is it so serious?" It seems that you also have your own pain. Mobetter sympathetically knocked down the bar and sipped his mouth. "I tell you, men must never marry, it will be the beginning of a painful life!" do you know? When she appeared a little emotional volatility, they would beat me out, beat me happy, when I hit shy, angry also beat me, beat me anyway, how would like! I decided, from now on, no longer go home! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is getting married with Shatas? Klein silently for two seconds, looked at Mobate's face and found no traces of bruising and swelling. This shows that the Elf singer still knows that the man wants to face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked with some sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Why are you marrying her?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
