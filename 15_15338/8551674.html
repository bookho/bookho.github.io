			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I also paid extra for the "Clown" formula... This is the original 为了 为了 分 分 孽 孽 孽 孽 孽 孽 孽 孽 孽 孽 孽 孽 孽 孽 孽 孽 孽 孽I haven’t been able to find a chance to say that I actually have the formula of the “Clown” potion... Klein took a breath and tried to squeeze out the smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is going to be smooth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is in favor of Dunn’s decision to return to continue to observe Chanis Gate, because he lacks professional skills in surveillance and investigation. And in frontal combat, it also does not reach the passing line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of shooting, he is better than the average policeman, but the players are all extraordinary people with improved physical fitness, even if they are not sharpshooters. Not much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for melee combat, Klein is the level of entry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, even if there are a sleepy spell, a sleeping spell, and a dream spell, he is still an auxiliary type of extraordinary person. It is very simple to deal with ordinary people. Those who are good at fighting are quite dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I promoted the sequence 8, I became a "clown" who is good at skillful fighting and may have a small amount of spells. I can do the extraordinary tasks alone... ... well, if you can successfully steal the power of the seal "3 - 0782" and make the "Yangyan Charm", it will be even more perfect. It is not impossible to win weakly. Klein is thinking with expectation. Slowly walked back to the Black Thorns Security Company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the next morning, he ended his duty and left the Chanis Gate. The night squad’s monitoring of the madhouse Hood Eugen still failed to get useful. The clues can only be hoped for by the so-called informant's internal investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got home, Klein quietly used up the breakfast, lay back in the bedroom, and slept until 12 noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He naturally woke up, washed a little, smelling the smell of food on the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melissa is preparing lunch?" Klein looked to Benson, who was reading the newspaper in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson lowered the newspaper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, she has a visitor today, I Let her chat with the guests, I am going to prepare lunch, and as a result, she does not trust my cooking and pulls the guests into the kitchen, which is very rude.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Benson, you are so quick to notice that Melissa is disgusted with your cooking... Klein smiled and walked to the single sofa, and asked casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Melisa's guests?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you should know Elizabeth, who I met at the Selena birthday dinner." Sen leaned back and continued to read the newspaper comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just seen at the birthday party... She actually came to visit... Klein’s expression was slightly sullen, looking sideways at the kitchen door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Melissa walked out with her plate, followed by Elizabeth, who also wore an apron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein, are you awake? I am going to call you." Melissa was delighted to put a meaty dish on the table. "This is Elizabeth, you know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Klein." Elizabeth, with a cute baby fat face, greeted her with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein responded politely and gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two of them greeted each other, Melissa narrowed her eyes and said very seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Elizabeth will follow us to the 'Helping the Family Servant Association'. They employ several servants and have a wealth of experience in this area, which can give us some advice."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, we have already prepared the request for the selection of the miscellaneous maid, you listen to see what needs to be added."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Melissa rubbed her hand on the apron, took a piece of paper from the pocket of her home, and began to read:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1. Good health."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2. Hardworking, responsible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 3. Good at cooking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"4. Quiet, not noisy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"5 The family background is simple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"6. looks ordinary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requests one after another were read out. Klein and Benson heard half of their mouths and looked stunned. They didn’t expect to hire a miscellaneous maid. trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melissa, have you not opposed the employment of miscellaneous maids before?" Klein subconsciously asked when his sister stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa snorted, Zheng focused: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I object However, since my objection is invalid, then I think that we must do this well, and to do a good job, we must have enough preparation beforehand. Well, do you have anything you want to add?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!" Klein and Benson shook their heads at the same time, causing Elizabeth to cover her mouth and snicker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used lunch, a group of four people took the rail public carriage to the "Tingen City Helping Family Servant Association" on Champagne Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually very close to the “home economics company” that Klein knew in his lifetime, but it is semi-charitable. On the one hand, they register personal information of various servants and The job requirements are convenient for the employer to select, and at the same time increase the employment of the recipients. On the other hand, they will organize some basic training to improve the working ability of the recipients. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of their maintenance funding comes from charitable organizations, and some of the additional payments belong to employers, relying on agglomeration, integrity, convenience and organization, and soon Force those personal agents to either join or change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the association, Klein and others immediately received warm hospitality, a young woman wearing a pale yellow ruffled dress led them to the sofa The area sat down and smiled and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can I help you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We need to hire a miscellaneous maid." At this time, Benson was pushed to the front by his brother and sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have specific requirements?" the young lady asked skillfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson seriously recalled the comparison between his own cooking and Klein, quite earnestly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Good at cooking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good at cooking?" The young lady frowned slightly. "Frankly, no one in the miscellaneous maid is good at cooking, you guys Is it better to hire a chef? If you need a female chef, there are quite a few of our associations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The miscellaneous maid is not good at cooking?" See your own requirements At first, she suffered setbacks, and Melissa couldn’t help but interject her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lady nodded and answered affirmatively:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miscellaneous maid is either the daughter of the bottom worker They are either girls from the country, and the cooking they are exposed to is very poor. Even after the simple training of the association, they can guarantee that the food they make will not make people sick."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Melissa suddenly said that she finally understood that the plan did not change quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really a pity." Benson thought about it and organized the language. "Maybe we can change the requirements: willingness and ability to learn." Cooking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Benson’s brain turned so fast... I didn’t need to interject it... Klein sat next to him, holding a stick in one hand, one hand Take the hat, leisurely and comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is no problem, when cooking training, we will record those girls who are outstanding." Young lady professionally laughed, "There are additional requirements. ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
