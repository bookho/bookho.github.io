Klein’s spirit was tense in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has experienced too many accidents, and he is also aware that he is prone to extraordinary events. When he encounters a similar situation, he is inevitably highly vigilant and very traumatic. The feeling of sequelae. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seriously watching Hailuer. Maht’s back disappeared on the stairs, and Klein noticed that the other party was only rushing and not panicking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to mean that the situation is in her hands... and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, There are extraordinary protections, um, the eldest son of Earl is also here, his bodyguards must be extraordinary... In addition, the Church of St. Seychelles is a ten-minute drive from Burke Lund Street. What is the problem? The night priests and pastor bishops can come at any time... unless they have the determination to die, no one will create an accident at this dance... Klein is calming and has another guess on the situation of Hailuer. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rushed to the third floor to solve the negative effects of magical items! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, Klein asked Arrods’ question, where can I get magical items that can steal the extraordinary ability of others, and the answer given by “Magic Mirror” One is Hailuer. Maht! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the scenes before dancing, Hailuer’s image was quickly rebuilt in Kline’s mind, with different accessories on her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hair accessories, earrings, necklaces, brooches, tulle gloves... What would it be? Klein regained his gaze and felt thirsty, so he picked up a glass of water and drank it clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just put down the cup and saw the ceremonial teacher Vahana Heisen carrying the plate and coming together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady is wearing a long red dress, but it is not tacky at all. She smiles at Daun. Don Tess: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found that you don't like drinking too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to miss important things because of drinking." Ryan is full of Daun. Tang Taisi has a deep image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he knows how to restrain and does not use a "faceless person" ability to change a finger to prove how determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wahana heard the words and smiled thoughtfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your past Full of mystery, this is a deadly attraction for many girls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not continue this topic, instead said:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forgot to tell you that my husband's troubles have been solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein picked up a glass of champagne and raised it forward Hey, said with a smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a very happy thing, congratulations to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He did not mention that he secretly helped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wahana looked at him deeply and raised the red wine in his hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Cheers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a sip, Klein politely said sorry, put down the cup and turned to the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not because he wants to go above the fog. It is simply because of the negative effects of the "Death Bell" revolver. Drinking too much water is going to be convenient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he stepped out of the bathroom, Klein looked up again at the second floor of the stairs leading to the third floor and found that Hailuer Mahett was descending step by step. The pace is no longer urgent, and the expression is calm and waveless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, no big problem... it should be the negative impact of her magical items... I don’t know what effect... Klein breathed a sigh of relief The eye dance floor, in the interval of the change of music, went to a lady and invited the other to dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just jumping and eating, talking and eating, the dance slowly came to an end, and one guest left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who has completed the business card exchange task, is also the same, but not the first one, nor the last one to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall quickly became deserted, and Mrs. Liana overtook the servants to clean up and waved her daughter Hailuer Mahett. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dau En. Tang Taisi’s performance is much better than I thought. Just now a lot of ladies have asked me about his situation in private." Mrs. Liana said implicitly, "Hayul, you just danced and chatted with Mr. Dontes, how do you think of him? You are more mature than girls of the same age, I believe in your vision and judgment." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows her daughter very well, so deliberately added the latter half of the sentence, otherwise Hailuer may not be interested in answering in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the mother, Hailuer is not so proud, thought: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" He is not too familiar with this circle, it is easy to raise the topic of offending people, but it is very insightful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"very insight..." Mrs. Liana was slightly surprised. Repeat the words of the daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her knowledge of Hailuer, this is quite a high evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but worry that her daughter liked Dawn. Don Tae. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haulul is not very comfortable with the surrounding martyrs because they are too young, too shallow, not capable enough? Dawn Dontes is exactly the type that precocious girls like... Liana suddenly regrets inviting the gentleman to come to the ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that Hailuer’s character, if caught in a love, is opposed, and it is entirely possible to elope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hayul seems to have noticed the idea of ​​her mother, no mood swings:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I only like men who are strong enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Liana sighed and no longer worried about the problem, because Hailuer was disdainful Lying girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late at night, Hailuer got up from the bed, with night vision ability, Put on clothes that are easy to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She climbed down from the balcony of her bedroom, carefully avoiding the bodyguards at home, sneaked out of the garden all the way to the middle of Berkland Street - Not all sewer entrances allow humans to pass freely and have vertical metal steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haulul skillfully removed the manhole cover, climbed down, and closed the manhole cover from the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly three quarters of an hour, she moved the manhole cover and returned to the shadow of the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Hailuer saw a black shadow lightly into the garden not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. 160..." She read the corresponding house number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the home of Dawn Dontes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third floor of the building, Klein once again woke up from his dreams because of his spiritual intuition, and wanted to catch the sneak hunters who interrupted his sleep. ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he directly opened the iron cigarette case and released the "resentment" secret couple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniol wearing a dark red jacket first walked into the full-length mirror, then jumped to the convex window glass of the close-fitting servant's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He" looked at Richardson and saw the man servant sitting up and sitting, afraid and nervously looking at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the blush of the moonlight, the sneak reveals a brownish-yellow complexion, soft contours, and short black curly hair, which is clearly the southern continent of the Bailang race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a little cold, he stood at the door and looked at Richardson, looking at himself, and said:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think about it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't think that you can get the quiet life you want, in your body The blood flowing through the people of death is destined to pay for the restoration of the glory of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think about your dead mother, think about the bullying you have been subjected to. Do you want your child to grow up in the eyes of others to discriminate forever? Do other people's servants?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...but, what can I do..." Richardson buried his head and said hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Awaiting the task for you." The voice of the sneak is softer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richardson didn’t answer well or not, and he still struggled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sneak did not care about his hesitation, when he had promised, turned directly to the body, quit the room, leaving the original way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death people...the spiritual group, or other people of the Balaam organization?" witnessed all the Klein lying on the bed, silent Self-speaking, "Will they let Richardson do the task? Steal my money, provide funding to the organization? Or create a terrorist incident in a banquet in a high-level circle?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the intruder has climbed down from the large balcony, through the garden, turned out the facade of the iron fence, and returned to the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw a figure on the left side fluttering over, busy with a flash, clenched his fist and slammed his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fist hit the shadow, but directly penetrated the past, just like the shadow of the gas street light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, his brain suddenly slammed and the whole person fainted to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hairour’s figure immediately appeared behind the sneak side, and the expression was slightly excited, seemingly completing a successful fraud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly converges on her emotions and maintains her arrogant posture, looking sideways at the black iron fence gate at 160 Burkle Lund Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl bent down and grabbed the sneak's arm and dragged him to the door of Dawn Dontes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Hailuer released his left hand, dealt with the traces, and slightly lifted the first two steps on the chin, and rang the doorbell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, her back quickly left quickly and returned home along the shadow of the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the gas street outside the 160th, the surface of the glass wrapped in a black metal fence, wearing a dark red coat wearing an old triangular hat, quietly reflected, Watching the whole process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to deal with it... Klein in the room thought hard With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that Hailuer is kind enough to help the neighbors solve the sneak, and does not leave a name, but in this way, after the butler’s alarm, the matter will go deep into the investigation and it will definitely Transfer to the value of the night, when, the intruder who gets dizzy will be an important issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Klein is really just an ordinary person, then nothing, casually investigators, but he is not only the strongest of the sequence 5, but also planning to steal The items behind the Chanis Gate did not want to be interrupted by accidents and had to change their identity again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, his earliest idea was to find an excuse to dismiss Richardson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
