			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Jowood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the deep red light faded, Fols saw a familiar desk and a notebook with inspirational records. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her, this experience has not had any novelty, but still makes her a heart of awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a power that does not belong to human beings, even if it is half-god and half-human! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The appetizer's stomach bag can be obtained in two days, my 'apprentice' potion has been digested... Finally, to become a master of tricks 'Well, I don’t know what kind of extraordinary ability I will get... I will definitely pay more attention to me by completing my promotion. After that, in addition to the potion formula, I will definitely provide more or less extraordinary materials. I look forward to it, I even I don't know what the corresponding sequence 6 and sequence 5 are. I only know that sequence 7 is a 'astrage'. When I become a master of tricks, I immediately write to the teacher..." Fols felt that he was close to the curse of the full moon. A step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, she heard a rush of footsteps from near to far, and finally turned into the door of the "jingle." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hugh and go out, it’s really busy." Fols silently sighed, "If it weren’t for her to repay the £400 for the Viscount of Glallett, we It is time to take a vacation in Desi Bay.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long period of hard work, some of the previously impossible commissions have become easier thanks to the strength In addition, from time to time, I can get some small rewards from the golden mask man. Hugh has raised his deposit from 110 pounds to 320 pounds, leaving only 80 pounds to pay off the debt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I can help her to put this 80 pounds first, but unfortunately, although she is not tall, her self-respect is still very strong... Forsy retracts her thoughts, Consider the things entrusted by Mr. "World". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a doctor, a writer, she doesn’t know much about radio, or even the whole mechanical field. She usually doesn’t pay attention to relevant content when reading newspapers. I don’t know where to go to buy the ticker that the other party wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Department store? It doesn't seem to be... ah, Avile is writing sci-fi novels, and you should know a lot about it." Fols quickly I found the object I was asked for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she immediately had a new problem, is she going to visit directly, or write a letter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After squinting the easy chair with a thick soft blanket, smelling the coffee and tobacco scent that permeates the room, feeling a slow, creeping warmth, Buddha The driving force of Ershi’s exit is a little bit broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not familiar with him, I shouldn’t rush to visit." She muttered and sat down and spread out the stationery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BMW City, Berg Home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick opened his eyes and woke up from his pretend sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his original plan, it is time to hold a sacrifice ceremony and send out the stomach bag of the spirited person, but the words of "downside down" remind him, let He decided to be cautious and observe more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount... First collect the materials that Mr. "Down Man" wants, complete the sacrifice in one go... Dairik is silent for a few seconds, don't go "Hurricane Axe", went straight to the minaret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first checked the current items at the meritorious exchange point, did not rush to complete the transaction, intends to wait for the sky lightning to reduce, then go to the underground trading market to see one look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick went up to the third floor and went straight to the myths and legends of the library and the ancient classics. He was hungry looking for unlearned and valuable Know how. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw a book with hard and yellow cover:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Giant Wang Ting Black Rock Book Collection"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directly passed down from the giant Wang Ting? I don't know if there is anything related to "King of Angels"... Dairik reached out and pulled out the book and found it bound by a piece of brown monster paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, on the upper level of the library, wearing a linen shirt and a brown coat, Colin Iliat stood quietly and looked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of care of his white hair was gently twitched by the wind blown into the window, and the light blue eyes were deep and restrained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wednesday, January 12, 5:40 pm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is dim, the clouds are like a roll, the deep blue waves are high and low, ups and downs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White Onyx" is in the scene of this storm coming up and down, like a toy in the palm of a giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the sea, no matter how powerful it is, it seems small in front of it." Daniz stood at the window and admired the scene outside." Fortunately, we are coming to the 'generous city'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the Banxi port, the "White Onyx" has been sailing smoothly. With the help of the wind, the speed is stable at 15 knots. Therefore, only arriving at Port of Thiana later than the scheduled time will complete the journey half a day earlier than normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the "White Onyx" that arrived in the "Generation City" on the morning of the 13th will arrive in Hong Kong on the evening of the 12th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When listening to the feelings of arriving at Niz, Klein just looked up at him and took his eyes back and continued his meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you play the role of "German Sparo", the more you have to insist on making people's behaviors at some point, he The more profoundly I realize, the kind of person I am, the choices he really wants to make in the face of different scenes are not the same as "German Sparo". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, normal he will respond to Daniz at this time, chatting with the other side about the weather at sea and the disaster caused by the horrible storm, but Germans Paro will not, must be treated indifferently, introverted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The more similar the contrast, the more I can recognize myself." Klein sighed intently in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what he didn’t have when he was a private detective, Sherlock Moratti, because at that time, he didn’t need to pretend to be a character. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that my potion has digested a little...but,German Sparo also has the same place as myself, at least choose to disembark, enter the class When Xigang rescued people, I myself and this identity are completely overlapping, there is no difference... Of course, it can be said that I have added people to a certain extent, and Sven and Crazy is a kind and brave , pity, heart of affection, huh, huh, boasting is not allowed, if you know that Banxi is Binxi, I, I am mostly stunned... not necessarily, at least the danger of divination at the time is within the acceptable range... Klein is half-summary and self-deprecating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes him more invented, although a person who plays purely fiction can help him digest the potion, but to speed up and improve progress, indeed Need to replace an existing identity, get the affirmation of the other person's interpersonal relationship, feel the corresponding emotions of emotions, immersion but not addiction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become anyone, but eventually return to yourself? And get feedback from the people? Klein looked at the pale yellow carpet and had a lot of thoughts in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Greman. Sparo did not respond, Daniz reluctantly spread his hand and felt that he was panicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides letting me do something that servants do, this crazy guy is very good at everything else, only a little, not talking, having communication barriers, so going on I will definitely go crazy... okay, okay, I have to go to Baiam, I can finally get rid of it! Daniz feels that sooner or later he will develop his own habit of talking to himself in a similar silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he saw that Greman Sparo looked up and smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You can talk about what are the pirate contact points in Byam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Dog! You still don't want to talk better! Daniz’s expression was distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
