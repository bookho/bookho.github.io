			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey knows that he is being influenced by the extraordinary power of the mind and spirit, only because of the "angel blessing" provided by Mr. "fool" I got rid of that state, so I decided to give a little bit of confession, to numb the other side with a small secret, to conceal more crucial things, and to exchange for greater trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why she does this is not because she does not believe in angels, but because she feels she can observe each other and the other can observe herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she is always "hidden" in the "dark place" and is not treated as an extraordinary person, she will not be suspicious if she is normal, but she is willing to Pay attention to the members of the psychological alchemy club. After all, the other party is professional, and she can only enter the circle halfway. The experience is not rich enough and not comprehensive enough. It is likely to expose certain problems in some places that have not been discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, it is better to "confess" this opportunity, completely dispelling the doubts of some members of the psychological alchemy club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——She called the angels before, and wrapped them in layers of wings as a “blessing”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing Audrey’s answer, both Islant and Hampshire showed a surprised expression for a moment, and for a moment they suspected own ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert sketched his mouth, smiled slightly, without any unusual reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is nodded with satisfaction, his voice softly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your honesty is appreciated." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there anything else to say? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey pretending to shake his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert thought about it and asked a few more words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are In which extraordinary person party to buy the 'audience' formula? Who bought it from? Where did you get the material for the potion? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey's eyelids turned slightly, making a look of memories:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The extraordinary Party meetings must be kept confidential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't see what the person who sells the 'audience' formula looks like, but from his speech, he can judge that he is a believer in the storm." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, Hilbert gently beheaded and seemed to think of something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey continues to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My 'audience' potion material is mostly What I found from my treasure house came from an exchange with a few friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two "audience" potions... she silently added one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of them were found in their own treasures... Hilbert and Isilante chewed this sentence, and they could not speak for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, Hilbert nodded to Islant and Hampres, indicating that he had no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting the same reply, some of the golden color in his eyes quickly faded, and the mullion in the scorpion quickly faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert got the heart of the candle again, letting the fire jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, Audrey found that the strange power that affected her disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She converges on her sly look and uses the look of doubt and inquiry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to be a 'viewer'." Hilbert chuckled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Audrey showed her surprise and confusion at the right time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know what kind of emotional response should be, know what kind of emotional response should have the details and physical movements, is the "reader" Basic skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be nervous, we don't mind this thing, just the last inspection.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, passed all the tests, now you are a full member of our psychological alchemy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." Audrey hesitated and smiled. "It feels like a dream." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately stood up, carrying a skirt, and gave a tribute to Hilbert and others, and smiled at it:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are now companions. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A noble and glamorous girl is so polite, and Isilant and others immediately can't sit still, and at the same time get up and pay a courtesy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After re-sitting, Hilbert organized the following language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Audrey Miss, I am now officially introducing you to the situation of the psychological alchemy club. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Audrey smiled. "It's fine to call my name directly." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert features nodding, leaning back on the body, lifting his right leg, and clasping his hands:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The initial psychological alchemy was just a hobby seminar, they all believed that the mind has endless power and endless magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Later, this seminar got a treasure map and found the remains of Hermes."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hermes of Hermesian?" Audrey asked with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, he is one of the earliest masters of occultism in human beings. He created the ancient Hermes language with a magic that directly resonates with the forces of nature. He is active in the dark. The Second Age, at that time, human beings were only the servants and slaves of the giants." Hilbert said with respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed softly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original members of the psychological alchemy club from the ruins I found a lot of things and found that Hermes is a master of occultism in the field of mind. His research is the dragon that dominated the sky in the Second Age, and the accurate description is the dragon of the soul family.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The information he left indicates that the soul dragons have gone a long way in this field and achieved the equivalent of the gods. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that "The Dragon of Dreams" is an ancient god... Audrey is a little self-satisfied.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The information laid the foundation and direction of our psychological alchemy . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We believe that the mind has many secrets, each of which is hidden in a very deep place, difficult to grasp, oh, please forgive me for using this adjective, in my It seems that this is the most appropriate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The exploration of those secrets, a little mistake, will make itself irreparable damage, Audrey, you want Remember, this must be done with caution. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Audrey nodded, he continued:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we can figure it out The mystery of the soul, on the one hand, can unearth the power hidden in the depths of consciousness, accomplish many magical things, on the other hand, it can affect and even master the hearts of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After reaching this level, the front is the ocean of collective subconsciousness, which is the place we most want. Of course, the description of the collective subconscious is not accurate enough. I like to call it the spiritual world of all creatures. It has a hidden and wonderful connection with the spiritual world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can master this spiritual world, what will happen? The extraordinary ability?" Audrey showed her curiosity and shallowness in this regard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should have noticed in the real world Some wonderful things, when we want to get an item, it will happen. When we want to visit a friend, he will just knock on the door. When we are eager for something, it will happen at the same moment. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You might say that this is a coincidence, but sometimes, there are too many coincidences. Our research shows that such coincidences often stem from unconscious, magical spiritual influences.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you can master the world of the mind, that is, the ocean of collective subconsciousness, you can master the 'coincidence', let the occasional phenomenon become the echo of your heart, want it to appear It appears. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, this is amazing." "Audrey had heard the "sun" before mentioning the "dragon of dreams", but the other side explained far less than Hilbert's details.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill Burt chuckled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At our level, it is better not to discuss such a deep problem, it is easy to lose yourself, I continue to introduce psychology Alchemy club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Discovering the ruins marks the establishment of the organization. The original members originally wanted to maintain the state of the previous academic discussion, but they always need help, and they lack it. The same is true for articles and research materials, so psychological alchemy will gradually have regulations and become a real secret organization.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, and other hidden organizations In comparison, our structure and relationship are still quite loose. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly what I like." "Audrey expressed his attitude.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert explained the main rules and concluded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "When you are at a higher level, you can see other members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am now giving you the sequence 8 'Reader''s potion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, there is a preparation for the "reader" potion... Audrey is both fortunate and proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the bottle of ecstasy psychedelic potion, she hesitated:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to go back and take it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still no trust in us, but still to confirm... Hilbert interprets Audrey’s ideas. Smile responded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With your performance, drink the 'reading heart 'The potion will not have any problems. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey smiles, thanks, and then tries to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Can you give me the 'psychologist' potion formula? I want to collect materials in advance, not wasting time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Others join the psychological alchemy club, in addition to hoping to get the formula, is not to apply for the corresponding extraordinary materials from within the organization? Which one does not care to say I want to collect it in advance? Hilbert, Hampres and others look at the usual girl, and can’t speak for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few seconds, Hilbert barely smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will help you apply first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Normally this requires merit, and merit comes from the tasks we assign, the research contributions you make, and the new materials and new items that you collect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I will try to do it." Audrey said briskly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Islant's home, she was quiet all the way, didn't talk, until she entered the room, and sent her to the close-fitting maid Anne and others. Golden Retriever laughs: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Su Shi, your potion has ~!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Unfortunately, the colorful lizard that Alfred found was not used, and he could only change it for money... Audrey felt a sigh in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi looked at the bottle of "reader" potion and swayed his tail cheerfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On her neck, Audrey hangs a pair of Phnom Penh glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
