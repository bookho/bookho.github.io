			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey knows that he is being influenced by the extraordinary power of the mind and spirit, only because of the "angel blessing" provided by Mr. "fool" I got rid of that state, so I decided to give a little bit of confession, to numb the other side with a small secret, to conceal more crucial things, and to exchange for greater trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why she does this is not because she does not believe in angels, but because she feels she can observe each other and the other can observe herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she is always "hidden" in the "dark place" and is not treated as an extraordinary person, she will not be suspicious if she is normal, but she is willing to Pay attention to the members of the psychological alchemy club. After all, the other party is professional, and she can only enter the circle halfway. The experience is not rich enough and not comprehensive enough. It is likely to expose certain problems in some places that have not been discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, it is better to "confess" this opportunity, completely dispelling the doubts of some members of the psychological alchemy club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——She called the angels before, and wrapped them in layers of wings as a “blessing”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing Audrey’s answer, both Islant and Hampshire showed a surprised expression for a moment, and for a moment they suspected own ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert sketched his mouth, smiled slightly, without any unusual reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is nodded with satisfaction, his voice softly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your honesty is appreciated." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there anything else to say? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey pretending to shake his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert thought about it and asked a few more words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are In which extraordinary person party to buy the 'audience' formula? Who bought it from? Where did you get the material for the potion? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey's eyelids turned slightly, making a look of memories:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The extraordinary Party meetings must be kept confidential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't see what the person who sells the 'audience' formula looks like, but from his speech, he can judge that he is a believer in the storm." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, Hilbert gently beheaded and seemed to think of something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey continues to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My 'audience' potion material is mostly What I found from my treasure house came from an exchange with a few friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two "audience" potions... she silently added one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of them were found in their own treasures... Hilbert and Isilante chewed this sentence, and they could not speak for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, Hilbert nodded to Islant and Hampres, indicating that he had no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting the same reply, some of the golden color in his eyes quickly faded, and the mullion in the scorpion quickly faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert got the heart of the candle again, letting the fire jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, Audrey found that the strange power that affected her disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She converges on her sly look and uses the look of doubt and inquiry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to be a 'viewer'." Hilbert chuckled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing what kind of emotional response you should have, knowing what kind of emotional response should have the details and physical movements, is the basic skill of the "reader". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be nervous, we don't mind this thing, Just the last inspection.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Congratulations, passed all the tests, now, you are a full member of our psychological alchemy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." Audrey hesitated and smiled. "It feels like a dream." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately stood up, carrying a skirt, and gave a tribute to Hilbert and others, and smiled at it:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are now companions. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A noble and glamorous girl is so polite, and Isilant and others immediately can't sit still, and at the same time get up and pay a courtesy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After re-sitting, Hilbert organized the following language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Audrey Miss, I am now officially introducing you to the situation of the psychological alchemy club. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Audrey smiled. "It's fine to call my name directly." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert features nodding, leaning back on the body, lifting his right leg, and clasping his hands:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The initial psychological alchemy was just a hobby seminar, they all believed that the mind has endless power and endless magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Later, this seminar got a treasure map and found the remains of Hermes."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hermes of Hermesian?" Audrey asked with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, he is one of the earliest masters of occultism in human beings. He created the ancient Hermes language with a magic that directly resonates with the forces of nature. He is active in the dark. The Second Age, at that time, human beings were only the servants and slaves of the giants." Hilbert said with respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed softly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original members of the psychological alchemy club from the ruins I found a lot of things and found that Hermes is a master of occultism in the field of mind. His research is the dragon that dominated the sky in the Second Age, and the accurate description is the dragon of the soul family.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The information he left indicates that the soul dragons have gone a long way in this field and achieved the equivalent of the gods. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that "The Dragon of Dreams" is an ancient god... Audrey is a little self-satisfied.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The information laid the foundation and direction of our psychological alchemy . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We believe that the mind has many secrets, each of which is hidden in a very deep place, difficult to grasp, oh, please forgive me for using this adjective, in my It seems that this is the most appropriate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The exploration of those secrets, a little mistake, will make itself irreparable damage, Audrey, you want Remember, this must be done with caution. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Audrey nodded, he continued:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we can figure it out The mystery of the soul, on the one hand, can unearth the power hidden in the depths of consciousness, accomplish many magical things, on the other hand, it can affect and even master the hearts of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After reaching this level, the front is the ocean of collective subconsciousness, which is the place we most want. Of course, the description of the collective subconscious is not accurate enough. I like to call it the spiritual world of all creatures, and it has a hidden and wonderful connection with the spiritual world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert smiled and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should have noticed some wonderful phenomena in the real world. When we want to get something, it will happen. Appear, when we want to visit a friend, he will just knock on the door, when we are eager for something to happen, it will happen at the same moment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You may say that this is a coincidence, but sometimes, there are too many coincidences. Our research shows that such coincidences often stem from unconscious, magical spiritual influences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you can master the world of the mind, that is, the ocean of collective subconsciousness, you can master the 'coincidence' and let the occasional phenomenon become It is the echo of your heart, and you want it to appear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, this is amazing." Audrey had heard "Sun" before The "Dragon of the Nightmare" was terrible, but the other side explained far less than Hilbert's details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert chuckles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At our level, or not It’s better to discuss such a deep question, it’s easy to lose yourself. I will continue to introduce the psychological alchemy club.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Discovering the ruins marks the establishment of the organization, the first members Originally, I wanted to maintain the state of pure academic discussion before, but they always need help when they encounter things. The same is true when they lack items and research materials. Therefore, psychological alchemy will gradually have regulations and become a real secret organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, our structure and relationships are still quite loose compared to other hidden organizations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is exactly what I like." Audrey said. Hilbert explained the main rules and concluded:<br /><br />&nbsp You can see other members.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am giving you the recipe for the sequence 8 'Readers'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a preparation for the "Reading the Heart" potion... Audrey is both fortunate and proud.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; After seeing the bottle of ecstasy psychedelic potion, she hesitated: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to go back and take it again." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still some point of distrust and we have to confirm... Hilbert interprets Audrey's thoughts and smiles and responds:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With your performance, you will not have any problems with the 'Readers' potion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey smiled, thanked him, and then tried to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can give me the psychiatrist's potion formula. I want to collect materials in advance, without wasting time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Others join the psychological alchemy, except that they want to get a recipe, not just to apply from within the organization Corresponding extraordinary materials? Which one does not care to say, I want to collect it in advance? Hilbert, Hampres and others looked at the usual tone of the girl, and could not speak for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, Hilbert barely smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will help first You apply.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Normally, this requires merit, and merit comes from the tasks we assign, the research contributions you make, and the new materials and new items that are collected. . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I will work hard." "Audrey said briskly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Islant's home, she was quiet all the time, didn't talk, until she entered the room, she sent her personal maid briefly. Anne and others only laughed sideways at the Golden Retriever dog:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
