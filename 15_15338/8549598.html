			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Neil voice just fell, the illusory eyes behind him in the darkness disappeared quickly, even Kline, who was in the "spiritual" state, could not Then discover the traces it once existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a representation of ritual magic." Old Neil explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little magical... is the enhanced version of the yin and yang eyes? Klein, like a child who got a new toy, looked away with interest and looked at every corner of the room, trying to see what the difference between the current alchemy room and the previous alchemy room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outline of the item is dim, and the long table, test tube, balance, cup, cabinet, etc. are no different from Klein’s opening of "Lingshi" and are not emitted. The brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object without life has no spirituality? Klein snorted and glanced over the silver casket on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, he saw that there was brilliance inside, or the blue was like the sky, or the 璀璨 is like a star, or the red is like a fire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The material from the extraordinary species also has some kind of life, sputum, activity? Even if the original owner is dead?" Klein considered the words, full of curiosity Ask the old Neil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The accurate description is that their spirituality will remain, which is one of the keys to the success of the potion formulation, and one of the root causes of the extraordinary control, Dunn I should have told you." Old Neal explained calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know what he was thinking, and suddenly he made a laugh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember' the corpse 'There are air-dried adult black spotted frogs in the formula. It takes a lot of courage to take this potion.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein imagined, felt A bit disgusting, not attached to the old Neil, turned his eyes to the dim around the lack of sufficient light, however, there is no such thing as the invisible spirits and ghosts he expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you say that the world of spirit is everywhere?" He wondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little guy, repeat it with me: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the headquarters of the Night Club, this is the underground of the Goddess Church, there are many extraordinary people!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think we will let the spirit and soul wander here? And the spiritual world and spirit are two concepts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Ryan was a little embarrassed for a moment, turned his head and pretended to look at the micro gas lights at the entrance to the dark door:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he spoke, his eyebrows suddenly began to twitch, uncontrollable, as if. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? Klein was waiting to turn around and ask, suddenly seeing the position of the dark door, the edge of the bright yellow light, a clear figure standing close to the transparent, it is human form, the color of the gas field is perfectly integrated with the dim environment, it is difficult to distinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein’s eyebrows violently hurt, his eyes tangled, and he concentrated his attention on it, but there was nothing “invisible” figure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odd...he turned back:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Neil, my eyebrows are in Smoking, a little pain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, this is very normal, you are the extraordinary person who just promoted, and the vision will cause a lot to your 'spiritual body'. Burden, and always produce consumption, the external appearance of the eyebrows, tingling, too sensitive, a little illusion and other symptoms, and in the state of vision, you can easily feel uncomfortable in a strange environment, it is easy to be others The emotional impact, this is a matter that needs attention, must be adapted and eliminated through repeated exercises, in addition, control use, and end in time." Old Neil smiled and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you get out of the state of vision?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally wanted to mention the "invisible" figure he just saw, but he heard "a little hallucination" in the symptoms. After that, the idea was dispelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with the twitching and tingling of the eyebrows, Old Neil’s answer can be guessed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Imagine the item as you just did, close the attention, then switch to the meditation state, close your eyes, control the spirit, repeatedly tell it to stop, then open your eyes "You can see that the vision is over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil described leisurely, adding to the end, "Of course, this is the most cumbersome and clumsy." The method, we can practice through, repeatedly suggesting ourselves in meditation, repeatedly affecting the spirituality, leaving a simple 'switching action', for example, I can easily open the mind and tap twice after tapping the eyebrows twice. You can simply end it, how to set it up, see your own habits and hobbies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." Klein thought about it and intended to imitate it. Old Neil, use the action of tapping the eyebrows twice as a "switch". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A moment" is easy to be confused with the instinct of the head, "three down" in the crisis situation may waste precious time, as for the action of firing the finger, too Personality, noticeable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gathered attention, remembered to gather a ball of light, and re-entered the state of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the guidance of the old Neil, after repeated hints and exercises, he finally "set" the "switch action". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightly clenched the fist and knocked the joint of the index finger at the root of the eyebrow. Klein had a brighter, different color and different color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocked twice again, everything went back to its original state, and there was no speciality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Final control..." He rejoiced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, he found himself tired as if he could sleep at any time, and his head seemed to have three all-night pains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are not 'sleepers', every time too much After practicing or overusing the vision, you need a sleep to recover. You can go home now, take a rest, go to the Welwich residence on the way to Iron Cross Street in the afternoon, and try to find the Antigonus family as soon as possible. The clues of the notes, until tomorrow, we continue the teaching of occult knowledge, of course, you can not forget to read those historical documents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein agreed with the arrangement of the old Neil with both hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the cane, out of the alchemy room, watching the dark door close, the old Neil returned to the arsenal, Klein rubbed his eyebrows and the temple, press With the handrails, step up and down the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Dunn Smith came from behind, his mouth was slightly tilted and his eyes were deep and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Listen to the old Neil, you are very comfortable, whether it is meditation or spiritual vision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe just the speciality of 'divination'." Klein replied modestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He guessed that Dunn was just guarding the arsenal for the old Neil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn slowed down, only a little ahead of Klein. After a few seconds of silence, he did not turn around and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to remember that curiosity kills cats and kills extraordinary people. Don't try to explore the whispers that should not be heard and the existence that should not be seen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein knows this is another reminder that the extraordinary is out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the Black Thorny Security Company, he and Roshan, who obviously do not know that they have become extraordinary, greeted each other and walked out the door to the street. I returned to Daffodil Street in a trackless public carriage and almost fell asleep on the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the house, many items have not been added, the living room and the restaurant are empty, and Benson and Melissa go to work and go to work, and they have already gone out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein can't take care of anything else, shut the door back, walk upstairs, and enter his own bedroom with bookshelves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking off the tuxedo and hanging it on the coat rack, he couldn’t wait to fall to the bed, and just fell into the pillow and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was awake by the bright sun. He leaned over his head and blinked slowly, finding that the outside sun was just right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What time is it? Don't miss the 'Tarot party' in the afternoon?" He struggled to get out of bed and walked to the coat rack because the pocket watch was still in the The inside pocket of the tuxedo has not been removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He not only forgot about this, but also forgot the door of the bedroom and forgot the curtains that slid the belly window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took out his pocket watch and opened it, and immediately let go of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only twelve o'clock, there is still a lot of time from the agreed three o'clock in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Today is Monday, the day of his meeting with "down people" and "justice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein made a thought, knocked on his eyebrows, and his eyes changed again, and he saw that his gas field returned to a bright color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocking twice again, exiting the vision, he easily walked to the first floor, burned the pot of water, put some inferior tea, and it and a little cream, Broken a rye bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Klein turned out the historical textbooks and the original master notes, and leisurely carried out "review" and consolidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 2:57 pm, Klein closed the book and covered it. Put on the pen cap and brush it up to draw the curtains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he locked the door of the bedroom and made the room very dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tapped his eyebrows twice, opened his mind and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there is no invisible body in this room, Klein ends his mind, picks up the pocket watch, and checks the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tick, tick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At three o'clock a minute, he stepped on his feet and walked four steps counterclockwise as before, and went into a square, and each step used Chinese meditation on the corresponding mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he did not prepare a staple food this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed his eyes and felt a little itchy back, as if the four black dots that formed the small square were prominent and emerging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream of madness and temptation began to reverberate, but Klein found that the headache was not as serious as it was last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that he is not affected, but that he can try to control himself not to take the initiative to listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becoming an "extraordinary", in this environment, he has more self-control ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, his "body" became lighter, floated up, saw the diffuse, gray, innocent, smoggy mist, saw the one The crimson "stars", and two of them seem to have a subtle connection with him, making him feel familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the vague self, and whispered a question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Neil Said the spirit of the star?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmed for a few seconds, once again on the fog to change the magnificent temple, the one is located in the wide dome The bronze long table below, and the twenty-two high back chairs with different constellations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
