			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is thinking about the original mysterious suicide and the unknowns that may be encountered Dangerous, after hearing the sudden knock on the door, the subconscious opened the drawer, took the revolver out, and asked with full vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was quiet for two seconds, with a slightly squeaky voice shouting in the Akhova cavity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I, Mombaton, Beech. Mountbatten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice paused and added:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beach. Mombaton... As the name got into the ear, Klein immediately thought of it. Corresponding owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s one of the police officers responsible for the neighborhood of the apartment. It’s a rude and brutal man, but maybe only such a person can shake the drunkards, Thieves, part-time thieves and villains, rogues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unique voice is one of his labels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I am coming soon!" Klein replied loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was going to throw the revolver back into the drawer, but thought that the police outside didn’t know why, maybe there would be a search and other actions, so he carefully ran to the rest. Next to the stove where the fire had already been extinguished, put the pistol in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he picked up the small basket of coal, shook a few pieces into the furnace, covered it on the gun, and finally placed the kettle on the top, covering it. Live all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do all this, he sorted out the clothes, quickly approached the door, and opened the side with a vague saying:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, just nap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four police officers wearing black and white uniforms and badges. Beechmont, who had a brown and yellow scorpion, coughed and said to Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The three police officers have something to ask you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police officer? Klein looked at the shoulders of the other three in a reflexive manner and found that the two had three silver hexagonal stars, one with two, and they all looked superior to Beech-Mount Barton, who had only three V-shaped labels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a history student, Klein has no research on the police badge level, only knowing that Beechmont is often showing off that he is a senior sheriff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, those three are inspectors? Influenced by the conversations of his classmates Benson and Welch, Klein still knows a little common sense. He let his body open and point to the inside of the house:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know what it is?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of the three police officers is a middle-aged man with a sharp-eyed look that can see through the heart and can’t help but be afraid. The wrinkles in his eyes were noticeable, and the edges of the hats were light brown hair. While looking at the room, he asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know Welch. Gevin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to him?" Kline’s heart trembled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am asking you." The majestic middle-aged police officer looked very stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police officer who also wears the Samsung badge next to him looks at Klein and smiles gently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be nervous, we just ask by convention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police officer is about 30, his nose is tall and straight, and the gray scorpion gives a deep sensation that is difficult to describe. A lake like the ones in the old forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean secretly took a breath and organized the language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you mean Huo I graduated from the University of Iowe, from Welch McGovern of Conston, then I know that we are classmates, follow the same mentor, senior associate professor of Quentin Cohen."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the kingdom of Luen, "professor" is not only a title, but also a position, just like the combination of a professor and a department head on the earth. That is to say, a university department can only have one professor, and an associate professor wants to turn "positive". ", can only wait for the boss to retire, or squeeze the other side by strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the need to retain talents, after years of exploration, the Kingdom Higher Education Commission has joined senior associate professors in the three-level system of lecturers, associate professors and professors. Mrs. ladies and gentlemen who are high in level or senior enough to be professors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Klein looked at the eyes of the middle-aged police officer and considered the second one:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "To be honest, our relationship is not bad. During this time, I and him, and Naya, often meet, interpret and discuss the "Quaternary" literature he got, a note, police officer, he What happened?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged police officer did not answer, but looked at his ashamed companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman wearing a badge and a general officer, Wen Wen, replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, Mr. Welch passed away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come?" Although there was some hunch, Klein couldn't help but scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welch also died like the original owner of the body? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit scary! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nana?" Klein hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Naya also passed away." The ashes police officer said calmly. "They both died in Mr. Welch's residence." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Killed?" Klein vaguely guessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe suicide...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash police officer shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, from the traces of the scene, they are suicide, Mr. Welch hit the wall with his head, hit a lot, hit the wall full of blood, Ms. Naja drowned herself. In a basin, um, the one used to wash your face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible..." Klein was stunned and seemed to be able to imagine That weird scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl crouched on the chair and buried her face in a washbasin filled with water. The brown hair was soft and draped, and the whole person was motionless. Welch fell to the ground, staring at the ceiling with his eyes, his forehead completely shattered, bloody, and the traces of the wall being hit one after another, bloody...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early police officer's mouth moved a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We also think so, but autopsy results and on-site conditions have ruled out factors such as drugs and external forces They, I mean, Mr. Welch and Ms. Naya have no traces of resistance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable Kleen to speak again, he stepped into the room, fake Ask casually: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When was the last time you saw Mr. Welch or Ms. Nia?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said while using his eyes to indicate a companion with two silver stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a young police officer who looks like Klein’s size, black and green, looks good, and has a poet’s romantic temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the question, Klein thought sharply and thought about the answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"should be 6 On the 26th, we read a new piece of notes together, and then I went home to prepare for the interview on the 30th, um, the interview of the history department of the University of Timing."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tingen is known as the University City, with two universities, Tingen and Hoy, technical schools, barrister schools, and business schools, second only to the capital, Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just finished, the corner of his eyes saw the young police officer walked over to the desk and picked up the "notes" that were more like a diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bad! Forgot to hide it! Klein shouted shortly: "You!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young police officer smiled at him, but did not stop looking at the notes, and the ashes police officer explained :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a required program."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Beechcraft. The majestic middle-aged police officers were just watching, not interjecting, and did not assist in the search. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your search warrant? Klein had planned to ask such questions, but he thought about it carefully. The judicial system of the Kingdom of Lun did not seem to have evolved such a search warrant. At least he did not know if there was any. After all, even the police team was established for fifteen or six years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the original childhood, it was also called the Sheriff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein couldn’t stop, watching the young police officers quickly flip through “his own notes,” and the ashes police officers did not ask questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What strange thing?" The young police officer turned to the end and spoke openly. "And, what does this mean?" Everyone will die, Including me '..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the gods, is it not common sense for everyone to die? Klein was originally prepared to argue, but suddenly he thought that he had intended to "connect with the police" in order to guard against the dangers that might be encountered. It was just that there was no reason and no excuses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than a second, he made a decision, holding his forehead with his hand, and painfully answered:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I really don't know... After waking up this morning, I feel that I am not quite right, as if I have forgotten something, especially the part that happened in recent days, even I don't know why I have to write such a sentence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, confession is the best way to solve problems, of course, frankly speaking skills, what can you say? It can't be said on the one hand, which ones are said first and then what to say and another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a "keyboard" expert, Klein also studied a bit of speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's ridiculous! Are you a fool when we are?" Beachy Mombaton angered and interrupted, and he couldn't help it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lie is too boring, it is simply insulting the IQ of yourself and others! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are mentally ill, and it’s better than losing your memory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really." Klein calmly responded to the eyes of Mountbatten and the middle-aged police officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really not true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe it is possible." At this time, the ashes police officer slowly opened his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? This is believed? Klein himself was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash police officer smiled and looked at him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A specialist will come in two days Believe me, she should be able to help you recall the lost memories."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experts? Help with memories? In the field of psychology? Klein frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, what if I get the memory of my planet? He suddenly felt a toothache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young police officer put down his notes and searched the desk and the room again. Fortunately, he focused on the books and did not mention the kettle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, Mr. Klein, thank you for your cooperation. In recent days, you better not leave Tingen. If necessary, please inform the Mountbatten police officer. Otherwise you will become a fugitive." The ashes police officer finally snarled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is over? Today is coming to an end? No more questions, then investigate and investigate? Or will I take it back to the police station for punishment? Klein was in awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he also wanted to solve the weird event that Welch brought, and nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
