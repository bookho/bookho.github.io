			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong nose, sparse eyebrows, slightly drooping cheeks, pale blue eyes...Qilingus looks at himself in the mirror, up and down I looked at it a few times and confirmed that there is no difference between a man who is comatose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After drawing a few habits of the other side, he bent over and dragged the man on the ground to the side and stuffed it into the closet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he stretched his right hand and snapped his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take out the handcuffs and wipe the palm of his hand. Qilingus pulled the door of the closet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly returned to the front of the mirror, put on a black double-breasted dress, tied the bow tie, and then picked up a bottle of amber perfume, dripping A few drops on the wrist, then wiped to different parts of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hair was combed in the mirror, and Zilingers walked out of the door and closed it, waiting for the butler outside:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't let anyone enter my room with important items inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Baron Gramer!" The mottled butler pressed his chest and bowed his way. "Your carriage and accompanying servant are waiting for you downstairs, and the invitation of the Duke of Nigan is there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qilingus maintains the baron's style, gently indulging in the invisible, accompanied by the housekeeper, arrogantly headed for the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, a baron with a lot of debts, even ordinary security personnel are reluctant to hire, actually maintains a housekeeper, a close-fitting servant, two attendants , two first-class maids, four second-class maids, two laundry maids, a coachman, a horse-feeding man, a gardener, a chef, a chef's assistant, for these stupid nobles, decent is really Better than everything... This made me have to waste time learning their quirky pronunciation of certain words and the so-called aristocratic tone... Qilingus thought coldly and ruthlessly in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Jowood, a small apartment Inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh Dilcha sat on the bed cross-legged and looked at the novel by reading the novel with the window light: <br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really desperate, and there’s no clue to Quillings’s, and he’s always wondering what he wants to do in Bakerland.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They reported the police according to the scheduled plan, and secretly sent a letter to the police station that accepted the case, detailing the strange situation at the scene of the murder and the criminal suspected of Qilingus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response of the police department did not exceed their expectations, and the cautiousness was directly transferred to the "Punge" team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day of brewing, "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qilingus sneaked into Bakerland and spread it to various "law enforcement squads", Hugh and Foll Si also left the place where he had rented, hid it and conducted a covert investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t want to be found back in the police station to assist with the investigation, whether it’s a “deceased person” or a “night servant” and a “machine of heart” team. Members are hostile to extraordinary people who are not official and regard them as potential criminals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Hugh and Fols are not only escaping from the possible recourse of Qilingers, but also avoiding those "law enforcers." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is so easy for us to find out his purpose, Zilingers has long been buried in the cemetery, and the tombstone must have been overgrown." The flourishing weeds.” Fols replied unhurriedly. “What we need is patience. As long as this intensity of investigation continues, Zilingers will make mistakes. I have to say that it can make people The magical items that change into different looks are really enviable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold your hands on your knees and look at the window sill:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just worried that Zillings will act in a short time and then rush to escape Beckland before everyone reacts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;She paused for a few seconds and whispered: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know when I can get back what belongs to our family... I haven't seen it for a year. To my brother..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls comforted and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for you I have fulfilled my wish, please allow me to write your experience as a story, which is definitely very exciting and very interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, actually I think Audrey The generosity of the lady, even if the matter ends, she will give us a generous bounty. After all, we have been busy for so long, after all, we let Qilingus take the initiative to show up."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hope is like this... Hey, why can't I have an adventure?" Hugh grabbed the blond hair of himself and his shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls micro frowns:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the extraordinary world, adventures are often accompanied Danger, I still don't know what the proverb that will appear when the full moon is, and whether it will cause any bad changes. Oh, there are no dangerous adventures, but it is very rare, and your wish is really difficult. Realization, unless, unless we can get the care of the orthodox gods, or the gaze of a friendly secret, however, it is difficult to tell if this is a disguise of the evil spirit demon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh and straight back, painted a blushing moon on the chest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May Goddess bless me!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Nigan is located in the mansion of Queensland in Beckland, and a grand ball is going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is divided into two parts, one is the dancing hall, it is located on the ground floor, with gorgeous slate carved with complex patterns, and the corner has excellent Duke The band, along the stairs of the hall, is a two-story cloister that surrounds the circle. The guests carry a wine glass and stand in front of the railing, overlooking the dance below, similar to the fencing activities from the stands. From time to time, gentlemen walked to the lady or the lady to invite them to dance. If allowed, the two sides went down the stairs and entered the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the cloister not close to the hall, there is a door that is still another, and the back is basically a guest lounge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the door that is open is a corridor with different plaster statues on both sides, all belonging to the ancestors of the Nigan family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the way to the end, you can see another part of the ball, here is also a hall, with a long table, a variety of food and Fine wine, another band belonging to the Duke, played melodious and relaxing music for the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this hall, guests gather in groups of three or five, or sit or stand to communicate with various things, and those who wish to escape shortly Enter one of the balconies attached to the lobby, overlooking the scenery in the garden and the red moon in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey Hall, who skipped the opening dance, was standing on the second floor of the ballroom, staring at the huge crystal chandelier hanging from the roof. With a candle on it, but found that many people are eager to move, after coming to invite the dance, she wit away from here and embarked on the corridor leading to the "restaurant". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really boring, but you can’t help... Oh, they can’t let me watch it quietly there? I have to say that some people are very rich in expression when they dance, always reminding me of those animals that are courting... Audrey looked down at her toes and walked a boring step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the corner of her eye saw a figure close, busy slowing down, straight back, instantly turned back to an elegant and quiet Hall Miss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Baron Gramer." Audrey greeted with a perfect smile and etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite of the eyebrows and the pale blue eyes of the Gramer Baron smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Ok, Miss Hall, you are the brightest and most dazzling gem in this dance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps, she suddenly frowned, and the green eyes were full of doubts:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Baron Graham is not the same as usual..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past, when he saw a lady and a lady who were higher and more beautiful than themselves, their eyes would move to the side, they would not look straight, and then continually sneak ...but today, he is very confident..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, his perfume is not right. He used to distribute it when he attended various gatherings. The end of the 'Amber' fragrance is pure and light, not showing off but noble, that is to say, he will spray the perfume several hours in advance, so that the front and middle notes can be volatilized before the party. Just now, the scent on his body is the middle of the 'amber', thick and elegant..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey's footsteps are getting slower and slower, as a thorough Digesting the "audience" of the potion, her sensitivity to detail is by no means comparable to other extraordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she thought of a possible, green and bright eyelid that solidified:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wouldn't it be that Zilingers pretended to be?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Swollen hunger' has the ability to change into different looks!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey thinks more and more that this possibility is possible, a heart is raised and nervous Also panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's really 'Hurricane Lieutenant', what does he want to do? Unfortunately, you can't bring Su Shi to the dance party, or you can let it secretly observe it. Just now Baron Gramer... No, I have to remind my dad!" Aussie stepped up, Audrey stepped up, entered the restaurant, and found Hall Earl, who was communicating with the Chief Secretary of the Cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She outlined an impeccable smile, walked over and took the Ear of Hall, and said to others:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., can I borrow the Earl of Hall for a few minutes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful lady, this is your right." The gentlemen responded kindly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey took Hall Earl to the nearest balcony and found a secluded corner, the father of the middle-aged blessing:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, I have something to tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hall Earl originally had a pet smile, but Seeing her daughter’s expression is very serious and serious:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have just met Baron Gramer, but he is different in some details. For example, the perfume on his body is a middle-key of 'amber'. It used to be a tail tone, such as..." Audrey said herself. The difference observed, this can be explained with sharpness and care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description of the previous thing, she added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I listen to Grein The Priest mentioned that 'Hurricane Lieutenant' has the ability to change into the appearance of others. Has he not been in Beckland recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Earl of Hall was quietly listening and his expression became extremely dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he quickly smiled and appeased the slightly flustered daughter:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I will deal with it, you go to your mother, stay with her, she is in the lounge of this hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Beautiful and decent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to the lounge, she looked back at her father and saw that Hall Count was talking quietly with a nobleman, and his expression was quite serious. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey’s heart is involuntarily hanging up and feels that he must do something, lest his father, mother and brother suffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
