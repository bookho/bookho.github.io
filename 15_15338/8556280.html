			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron black that is full of singular patterns is quietly placed in the center, and there is a hidden wave in the air that is silently colliding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White is standing in the corner, lighting the candle in accordance with the normal ritual process, dripping the essential oil and the corresponding herbal powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;氤氲 The erratic atmosphere swayed, and Emlin recalled the requirements of “artificial sleepwalking”, lowered his head, began to meditate, and repeatedly mourned the “fools”. The name of the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fool who does not belong to this era;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mysterious ruler above the fog; Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king of yellow and black who is in good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the monotonous rhythmic voice, Emlin gradually entered a wonderful state, the body relaxed and restrained, such as sleeping, spiritual but lively and light, and constantly spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he has the feeling that he is constantly drifting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancient palace above the fog, Klein sat at the top of the bronze long table, tapping his fingers and looking at the light curtain next to it. I admire the praying figure without expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was vague, Klein recognized the other vampire Emlin White. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very courageous, and took out the action to buy the doll... Klein sighed and didn’t respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to divination of the blood family before, can not get effective revelation, the only certainty is that it has nothing to do with Aurora. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Klein quite curious, but he won’t take the risk of responding to Emlin White in a situation where a high blood group is hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know if the other person can grasp the traces, like the “渎神者” Amon, as dangerous as the mysterious space above the fog, and does not want to confirm, After all, Amon was only a avatar at the time, and now the high blood group is a big probability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to take risks on irrelevant things, even if you want to understand the true purpose of the blood family... and there is no other way... Klein Looking at the "artificial sleepwalking" state, Emlin White, smiled and said to himself: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can delay the response..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He plans to wait until tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, until Emlin White leaves the protection, wait until the blood family to give up the matter, and then suddenly respond! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this has a premise to first use divination to confirm the degree of risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The swallower...like the river?" Dairik Berger had a connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunter" Colin Zheng focus:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This means that we may have stepped into a river that can't leave, end to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, this should be just some of the power left by the angel of destiny, and He is not hiding here."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it’s not possible, it’s ok, and it’s already long... Dairik responded in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Colin took out a dark red metal tube, unscrewed the lid, and drank it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His light blue eyes quickly faded and stained with silver. At the end, the scorpion even stood up, reflecting the little boy Jack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Demon Hunter" Colin first inserted the long sword into the ground, and pulled out another straight sword in the backhand, applying it as golden as sunlight Fat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found this action, the little boy Jack's expression changes, just like a thick shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before he opened his mouth, "The Demon Hunter" Colin moved, and he took out the long sword on the ground, leaving a blur in place. Figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden and silvery, shining through the entire underground hall, the little boy in front of Jack is the most intense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a scream of screaming, the darkness resurfaced the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little boy Jack stood in the same place, did not move half a step, but the face between the chest and the abdomen has disappeared, leaving only the hollow that can see the creepy internal organs . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few meters away from the side of Jack, "The Demon Hunter" Colin was half-squatting on the ground and the two swords were drooping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of him, the face was torn apart and turned into scattered eyes, nose and mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These organs were twitched by electric shocks, bounced, and quickly settled down, rotted quickly, as if they were supposed to be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the moments, Dairik only felt invisible around him, and the water-walled barrier was prominent and shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, he seemed to have left the rushing river and returned to the shore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the gloomy underground hall, looking at the hanging statue, watching the expression twisted by pain, the little boy Jack in the coma, Dairik A happy heart, relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that he and others are finally getting rid of the repetitive life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick is very clear, although the final processing does not seem complicated, but in the case of not knowing the problem in advance, without getting a hint, maybe repeat Ten times and hundreds of times it is possible to find clues and find a way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, if you are not careful and careless, you will die, and Dairik can't know if the lost life will come back, or still "resurrection" In the bonfire, but died after completely getting out of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More seriously, people always repeat the same choice, that is, the first time they can’t find the problem, without the corresponding memory and experience. I am afraid that I will not be aware of the anomalies in the first thousand times of the first hundred times, completely lost in the circulating river until the normal time of the outside world has passed to the end of their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the thought of similar possibilities, Dairik was sincerely grateful to Mr. "The Fool" for being grateful to him for restoring his memory and giving hints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking sideways, he saw that Joshua and other squad members did not respond abnormally to check the surrounding area, just as the previous six explorations did not exist. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps returning to Silver City, they can find themselves lost from the wrong date... Dairik is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "Hunter" Colin stood up and walked back to the little boy Jack, took out another metal vial and poured the black sticky liquid inside. The other side of the empty chest and abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liquid quickly condenses into a translucent film that sticks to the wound and stops the blood flow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heinham, Joshua, you are responsible for bringing him." Colin suppressed the instigation of his heart, and he screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his eyes, this is the hope of Silver City to get rid of the curse and overcome the doomsday prophecy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call...Dyric wanted to cover the "fool" in a hidden way, but found no corresponding prayer gestures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sumptuous dinner sparkles with seductive colors in the light of many candlelights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike newspapers and magazines, the dinner of the big aristocratic family is not serious and does not need to remain silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is when family members rarely get together. They dine and chat freely on various relaxed topics to exchange feelings and strengthen connections. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey cut a steak from her own ranch and observed the expression of Earl Hall, without asking, curiously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, what happened to Prince Edsack recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her intention is, if not, I pretend that I have heard some rumors that are not in line with reality and that are not responsible. This is not uncommon in the nobility circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count of Hall’s knife and fork paused, raising his eyebrows and saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You heard What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough! Reading from the father's reaction, Audrey, who wants the information, responded with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some rumors, this seems to be true?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Hall smashed the forehead:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not something too serious.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Audrey, I know what you think, so you don't need to hide you. This involves a more common royal scandal. In short, Prince Edsack likes it. A civilian woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This led to the death of a descendant of the aristocracy, and the royal family blocked the spread of things and did not want to cause too much influence."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Countess has a mouthful of champagne:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that he is not mature enough."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mom’s criticism is euphemistic... This sounds really suspicious... Prince Edsac is really involved in dangerous things and will bring bad changes to Beckland? Audrey made a stunned look and smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This makes me wonder why the story of freedom and love involves the death of a noble descendant. ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hibert Hall bury his head and cut the tender meat chops, guessing with great interest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This reminds me of those complicated love stories. It is a very common thing for a lady of the storm to be a duel for a woman."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the tradition of being placed in a museum." Earl Hall denied the eldest son's statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey seized the opportunity and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My impression of Ed Prince Sark is not such a person, and rumors have already come out... Maybe they really want to cover up this thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe not..." Earl Earl chewed on this sentence, his brows were not consciously wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey is just right, no longer to say, naturally leads the subject to another direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is going to find other aristocratic friends to "inquire". As a girl who has been pursued by Prince Edsack, it is absolutely necessary to understand the details of the matter. A normal reaction, whether curious or unwilling, can drive people to make such an attempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Artificial Sleepwalking" state can't last long, Emlin. White returned to reality with a little exhaustion, opened his eyes and looked at the iron-black cockroach. Half of it was loose and half disappointing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Master Nibes did not respond."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
