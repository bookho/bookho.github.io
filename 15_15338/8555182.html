			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dak? In the mind of Dairik, the other party’s image emerged:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle is medium, the body is slightly fat, and the strength is strong. It is an optimistic, cheerful, smiling teenager. I am a student of general education and a teammate of the patrol team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the return of the semi-destroyed temple of "The Fallen Creator", he became deep and smiled at everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One recalls the changes of Dak Rikins, Dairik is chilling, all the body is cool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did he come to me suddenly? Just to get rid of isolation, isn't it time to go home? After the moment, Dairik had a lot of questions in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, he thought of a possibility:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luoweiya elders knew my doubts They have changed, so Pydak came to solve me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek was shocked, full of fear, and immediately thought it seemed like It’s not a bad thing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a saying that "If there is no suitable audience to testify for you, then you may wish to use your extraordinary person to monitor", and now, The monitor is in that corner, and if Dak suddenly attacks me, it will reveal the fact that they have problems! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, even if you don’t use the item of “World”, you can make things go smoothly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, Dairik turned his head and looked out the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the frequency of lightning has been reduced to a minimum, only one or two minutes to cross the sky, illuminate the air, the entire world of the entire Silver City most of the time They are all in deep darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only one person is at home, Deric will not turn over and find the candle to ignite, like to lie quietly in bed, thinking about everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he knows that this is actually more dangerous. If there is no light to dispel the darkness, even in the interior of Silver City, monsters may suddenly appear, but Dairik itself is "Prayers", with a certain bright attribute, do not have to be afraid of similar things happening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚! Dak knocked on the door again and seemed to be urging the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not like this before, he was very polite... Dairik suddenly had a strong sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a candle from the wooden box and placed it in the middle of the table, then licked his fingers to create a golden flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame ignited the candle, leaving the room full of dim but warm brilliance with a scent of scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The candles of Silver City are mainly made of grease extracted from monsters, and will have different tastes depending on the source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; took a deep breath, and Dairik walked to the door with a strong guard and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are you so slow?" Dak smiled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Find a candle." Dairik responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not dare to leave the back to the other side, took a side by side approach, and walked back to the table with the classmate and teammates, sitting down . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dumnut just dried, do you want some?" Dak took a small bag from his waist and asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dumgo is one of the most rare snacks in Silver City, derived from a plant called "Dum S.", which does not require light. It grows by sucking the nutrients of the decaying corpses, and has a certain tendency to attack. It belongs to the more common weak monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every "Dum blood vine" will produce many black fruits of thumb size, which can be eaten directly, crisp and fragrant, but they can not fill the human belly Can not provide the necessary supplements, can only be used as a daily pastime, a patrol can get a few big bags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Dak poured a bunch of black fruits from his little bag, picked up one, stuffed it into his mouth, and squeaked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derrick thought about it and asked him on his own initiative:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are at that temple Do you encounter monsters in the underground part?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dak stopped to chew and smiled and replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a lot of them, but they are not very powerful. It is very simple to be cleared by us. It has been destroyed for a long time. The powerful monsters should have left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He paused for a second, sketching his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We found some strange plants at the bottom of the temple, they are like a general education class. The recorded mushrooms are particularly bright, and they are full of appetite at a glance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is confirmed that they can be eaten directly, which can bring spiritual improvement and physical fitness. It becomes stronger, and if it is combined with a baked monster, it will emit an unimaginable fragrance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, he took out a palm-sized mushroom-like thing from another small bag, the handle was white as jade, the umbrella cover was bright red, and It is dotted with dark gold spots.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only seeing this plant, Dairik couldn’t help but swallow, it seems that he is already hungry. A few days.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful mushroom-like thing in the dim light of the candlelight, all the time, the tempting color, the appetite, it is difficult Control.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give you one. Dak smiled enthusiastically.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, good..." Dairik almost started on the spot and took the mushroom-like plant plug directly into the entrance. But in the end, I was patient and barely opened my mouth. "I will try it tomorrow. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark did not say much, pushing the "mushroom" in front of Dairik, and he continued to bite the Dumugo.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derrick took great effort to get his eyes removed from the "mushroom" and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the discovery of this exploration? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Dak stopped the snacking action, holding a black dum fruit and replied very seriously. "We found many murals, coherent murals, do you remember the statue in the temple?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. Dairik glanced at the "mushroom" and nodded. "A huge cross with a naked man hanging upside down, and its surface is also deliberately smeared with a lot of blood." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dak turned the next Dumgo Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Newly discovered murals Tell us that the builders of the temple believe that the statue represents the Lord who created everything, the omnipotent God, who believe that the Lord did not abandon this land, but that during the Cataclysm, it helped us to carry most of it. Sin, then changed from erect to inverted, from free walking to crucifixion, and bloodshed instead of us. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The grace is like the sea, we are not abandoned people, but the beloved ones, without the Lord carrying sins, instead of us bleeding, Silver City has long been Destroyed, humans have long ceased to exist!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the outside world, in the "downside down" Mr., "just" Miss, where they are in Lun The kingdom, there is no curse at all, there is no extreme darkness, there are no monsters in the depths of the darkness... We are not the ones who are being ignored... Dairik silently refuted a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If that is true, we can change the symbols of the sacrifice and the corresponding names, and we can regain the Lord's response..." Dak The fascinating description of the mural at the bottom of the temple speaks of his own guess, and Dairik finds it increasingly difficult to resist the temptation of the "mushroom". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, can't eat! If you eat it, you may be completely polluted by the "fallen creator" and become a fanatic believer... even if there are monitors, you will not find the problem... Dairik is afraid of a moment and feels that he must do something. What to get rid of the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
