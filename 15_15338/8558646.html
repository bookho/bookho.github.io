			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒哒哒, the radio ticker spits out a new unreal white paper in a dimly lit environment and a blushing moonlight:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leonard Mitchell is an angel of the Zoroastrian family, who has falsified my answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Angel? Leonard has an angel in his body? Angel of the Sorbian family of the Quaternary? Although Klein had already done a good job of hearing secrets, he was still shocked by the things revealed by Mirror Arrodes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is both a concern and a surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel refers to the extraordinary of Sequence 2 and Sequence 1, which is quite close to the position of the true God, has all sorts of singular characteristics, and can even be some kind of To the extent that it affects the lower sequence of this route, it belongs to the big man standing at the top of the real world. The churches only have the papal papal and the legendary monk are the angels on the ground. Therefore, Klein believes that this level is The strong parasite is not a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the second century of darkness, angels can have the name of God, as an affiliate of the ancient gods...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "There are not many angels I have contacted directly or indirectly. One is the "God of the Gods" Amon, the other is the "Queen of the Natural Disasters" Gao Shinam, and the other is the evil spirit of the suspected "Red Angel" Medici. One is the "swallower" of the small "sun" in the mouth of Uluos, one is the "miracle" in the Russell's diary, one is the son of the creator, Adam, one is unable to determine whether it is an angel or not. Mies, one is the "Destiny Snake" Will. Anthony in the mother's belly...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides the last two, the rest are very evil Even the words left behind can make the readers go crazy... The poet classmates will eventually become victims of angelic parasites...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can explain Why does he feel that he is the protagonist of the drama, the special one, willing to help me hide the secret... Zoroastrian family The grip is the 'stealer' approach, which is the way to steal other people's extraordinary abilities. Therefore, it is normal for Leonard to find and participate in the gathering of the destiny hermits... No wonder he volunteered to use the "vascular thief". It turned out that there was a grandfather's help, and he stole the most powerful ability of Mei Gaoousi...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, what the hermit of destiny is nothing but A group of thieves and scammers, at the end of the day, changed the goal of stealing and fraud into time and fate...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In short, the poet’s classmate’s grandfather is not like Good man, I have to find an opportunity to remind him... The problem is that they are always together, and the warning will only cause the problem to break out in advance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought sharply, always couldn't find a good idea, only temporarily pressed the matter, ready to write back and ask Mr. Azick and " Mercury Snake" Will Anthony, see if they have a way.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few minutes, he even used the "God of God" The idea of ​​Meng, in simple terms, is to reveal the thing that the angel of the Zoroastrian family is parasitic in Leonard Mitchell to the son of the Creator, and let him "eat" the "parasite" in the past. According to Klein, during the Quaternary, the Amon family supported the Tudor Empire, and the Zoroastrian family belonged to the Solomon Empire, two The enemy is the enemy. And according to the law of conservation of extraordinary characteristics, the stronger in the same way, the higher the sequence, the greater the conflict between them, just like the battle of two "mercury snakes".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this method is limited by the difficulties of reality and was eventually abandoned by Klein. This is because of roots. I don't know where to find the "God" Amon, the second is that the angel-level battle will directly destroy Leonard Mitchell, and the third is because the strong Amon may be a very serious bad thing.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let Emlin try to trade first, observe the specific situation by the way, and then decide how to do it after mastering more details... Klein converging thoughts, connecting mirrors Rhodes' radio receivers: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ask it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒哒哒, the sound of the radio ticker became quite brisk, and the illusory white paper sputtered very softly:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a subsidiary of my problem and I don't have to follow the rules.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great master, I have noticed that there is something strange outside your room, but I can't see it clearly. Can you tell me what it is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic The mirror is very powerful, it seems that everything can be seen, but it involves high levels of interference, being mosaiced... Klein calmly replies:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the snoring, Arrods presented a new word on the illusory white paper:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It...the great master, you can ask questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to remind about the 'probability of probability'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the radio ticker seems bright A little bit, no longer as gloomy as before, the spit out of the illusory white paper slows down:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a particularly stingy special vengeful guy, you have to be as soon as possible Give it to others!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the only thing that has been solidified into the 'wheel of fortune', you can give it to any 'mercury snake', and they will be very grateful to you, in short It is not suitable for being your servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The breath is about to dissipate, your loyal and humble servant Arrods has to leave, and finally, praise you again, my great master, the spiritual world The dominator, bye~"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uniqueness"... "The Probability of Probability" turns out to be the "uniqueness" of the "monster" approach... The first time I saw the so-called "uniqueness", it was really scary, and it was possible to digitize the entire real world... The "monster" path is also called the "wheel of fortune" approach, and the sequence 0 is the "wheel of fortune"? Klein looked at the radio receiver that had returned to normal, and he couldn’t recover his thoughts for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not have any greedy emotions about "probability", which is because the other party does not belong to the "divination" approach, and it has extremely terrible negative effects. It’s also a time of fear, and the scorpion’s nephew will attract the “swallower” Uluos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing gets above the fog, even if it can be isolated, sealed inside, most of the data can be used to digitize the mysterious space, after the Tarot party said Uncertainly, I changed the game of the group..." Klein had never touched this kind of top-level thing, and there was no way to judge what would happen after the "probability of ambiguity" was thrown over the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to continue to intimidate the nephew, and smoothly sent it to the island of Olav, and handed it to the members of the life school who had the means to seal. As for the problem of exceeding the standard, He didn't care, because the biggest benefit was the harvest of the friendship of Willy's Snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Harvest Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White holds a strange bead-sized badge and snoring in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The 'world' is really awkward, isn't it going to find a night-timer called Leonard Mitchell in the North Street, and even emphasizes that the other person has a secret, and a high probability can drag people into a dream.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is doubting my ability! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin stood up and put on a pair of tuxedo and white shirt, looking out the window.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, he has secrets, and I have secrets. I bet that Nybius or any count is staring at me secretly. I really want to give some help. I will definitely help... After considering it for a few seconds, Emlin took out a metal vial and prepared a bottle of azure medicine with the spiritual material inside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bottles and potions, he took the silk hat, walked out of the lounge, bid farewell to the Utravsky bishop, and left the harvest church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beckland's sky is very dim, and the thin mist is like water.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin blinked and put on his hat and said to himself: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sunshine is a bit dazzling..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
