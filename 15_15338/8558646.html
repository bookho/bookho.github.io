			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒哒哒, the radio ticker spits out a new unreal white paper in a dimly lit environment and a blushing moonlight:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leonard Mitchell is an angel of the Zoroastrian family, who has falsified my answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Angel? Leonard has an angel in his body? Angel of the Quaternary Zoroastrian family? Although Klein had already done a good job of hearing secrets, he was still shocked by the things revealed by Mirror Arrodes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is both a concern and a surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel refers to the extraordinary of Sequence 2 and Sequence 1, which is quite close to the position of the true God, has all sorts of singular characteristics, and can even be some kind of To the extent that it affects the lower sequence of this route, it belongs to the big man standing at the top of the real world. The churches only have the papal papal and the legendary monk are the angels on the ground. Therefore, Klein believes that this level is The strong parasite is not a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the second century of darkness, angels can have the name of God, as an affiliate of the ancient gods...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "There are not many angels I have contacted directly or indirectly. One is the "God of the Gods" Amon, the other is the "Queen of the Natural Disasters" Gao Shinam, and the other is the evil spirit of the suspected "Red Angel" Medici. One is the "swallower" of the small "sun" in the mouth of Uluos, one is the "miracle" in the Russell's diary, one is the son of the creator, Adam, one is unable to determine whether it is an angel or not. Mies, one is the "Destiny Snake" Will. Anthony in the mother's belly...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides the last two, the rest are very evil Even the words left behind can make the readers go crazy... The poet classmates will eventually become victims of angelic parasites...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can explain Why does he feel that he is the protagonist of the drama, the special one, willing to help me hide the secret... Zoroastrian family The grip is the 'stealer' approach, which is the way to steal other people's extraordinary abilities. Therefore, it is normal for Leonard to find and participate in the gathering of the destiny hermits... No wonder he volunteered to use the "vascular thief". It turned out that there was a grandfather's help, and he stole the most powerful ability of Mei Gaoousi...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, what the hermit of destiny is nothing but A group of thieves and scammers, at the end of the day, changed the goal of stealing and fraud into time and fate...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In short, the poet’s classmate’s grandfather is not like Good man, I have to find an opportunity to remind him... The problem is that they are always together, and the warning will only cause the problem to break out in advance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought sharply, always couldn't find a good idea, only temporarily pressed the matter, ready to write back and ask Mr. Azick and " Mercury Snake" Will Anthony, see if they have a way.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few minutes, he even used the "God of God" The idea of ​​Meng, in simple terms, is to reveal the thing that the angel of the Zoroastrian family is parasitic in Leonard Mitchell to the son of the Creator, and let him "eat" the "parasite" in the past. According to Klein, during the Quaternary, the Amon family supported the Tudor Empire, and the Zoroastrian family belonged to the Solomon Empire, two The enemy is the enemy. And according to the law of conservation of extraordinary characteristics, the stronger in the same way, the higher the sequence, the greater the conflict between them, just like the battle of two "mercury snakes".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this method is limited by the difficulties of reality and was eventually abandoned by Klein. This is because of roots. I don't know where to find the "God" Amon, the second is that the angel-level battle will directly destroy Leonard Mitchell, and the third is because the strong Amon may be a very serious bad thing.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let Emlin try to trade first, observe the specific situation by the way, and then decide how to do it after mastering more details... Klein converging thoughts, connecting mirrors Rhodes' radio receivers: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ask it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒哒哒, the sound of the radio ticker became quite brisk, and the illusory white paper sputtered very softly:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a subsidiary of my problem, I don't have to follow the rules.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great master, I have noticed that there is something strange outside your room, but you can't see it clearly. Can you tell me what it is? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mirror is very powerful, it seems that everything can be seen, but it involves high levels of interference, being mosaiced... Klein calmly replies: < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The probability of probability. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the snoring, Arrods presented a new word on the illusory white paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a great master, you can ask questions. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the 'probability of probability', you have What do you want to remind? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the radio ticker seems to be a little brighter, no longer as gloomy as before, and the spit out of the illusory white paper slows down:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a particularly stingy guy with special vengeance, the owner must give it to others as soon as possible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the only thing that has been solidified into the 'wheel of fortune', you can give it to any 'mercury snake', and they will be very grateful to you. In short, it is not suitable for being your servant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The breath is about to dissipate, your loyal and humble servant Arrods has to leave, and finally, again Praise you, my great master, the dominator above the spiritual world, bye~"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uniqueness"... "The Probability of Probability" turns out to be "Monster "The uniqueness of the route"... This is the first time I saw the so-called "uniqueness". It is really scary and can be used to digitize the entire real world... The "monster" path is also called the "wheel of fortune" approach, sequence 0 is the "wheel of fortune"? Klein looked at the radio receiver that had returned to normal, and couldn't recover his thoughts for a short time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't have a "probability" "There is any greedy emotion, which is because the other party does not belong to the "divination" approach, and it has extremely terrible negatives. If you are afraid of time, the scorpion will attract the "swallower" Uluos.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This thing gets foggy Even if it can be isolated and sealed, most of it can be used to digitize the mysterious space. Later, the Tarot party may change to run the game..." Klein has not touched this top-level thing, and it is completely impossible to judge. What happens when the “probability of ambiguity” is thrown over the fog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decides to continue to intimidate the scorpion and send it to Olav He is handed over to the members of the Life School who have the means to seal. As for the problem of exceeding the standard, he does not care, because the biggest advantage is to harvest the friendship of Willy Sting, the "Snake of Destiny."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Harvest Church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Emlin White, with a strange bead-sized badge, snorted in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'World' Is not go flat North West Street to find a named Leonard Mitchell nightwatchman who do? Even special emphasis on the other side has a secret, a high probability can drag people into a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is doubting my ability!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin stood up and put on The combination of the tuxedo and the white shirt looked out of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, he has secrets, and I have secrets, I bet, Nybius or any count is staring at me secretly, what an accident, really Definitely will provide some help... Entering the dream... Emlin considers it for a few seconds, takes out a metal vial, and dispenses a bottle of azure potion with the spiritual material inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting the bottle and the pharmacy, he took the silk hat, walked out of the lounge, bid farewell to the Utravsky bishop, and left the harvest church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin blinked and put on his hat and said to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sunshine is a bit dazzling..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped a rental carriage and went straight to the steam subway station. He spent 6 pence to buy a first-class ticket to the North District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This saves a lot of time than going straight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than 40 minutes, he arrived at the destination and stood outside the gate at 7 Pfister Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin politely rang the doorbell and waited patiently for a minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just prepared to write a note, stuffed it into the door, agreed on the time of the next visit, and finally heard the lazy footsteps come together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not like a servant... Emlin Wei nodded invisibly, took out the previously prepared potion, unscrewed the lid, and drank it clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he saw the door open and saw a man with a green hair appearing in front of him, seeing the other person wearing a white shirt and black trousers, clothing The hem of the hem was pulled out, and the wind swayed, and the temperament was so clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s a believer in the night, I have to say that I can still compare with our blood group in the appearance... Emlin took off her hat and lifted her chin.道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, are you Mr. Leonard Mitchell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leonard frowned slightly, looking at the handsome man with red eyes in front of him, raising his hand and covering his mouth, seemingly inadvertently yawning:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A visitor, I have something to ask for your help." Emlin did not reveal his identity. , smiling slightly proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of such an attitude makes Leonard inexplicable and familiar, just like seeing the past, always thinking that he is the most special one, It is the protagonist of the times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cleared his throat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just an ordinary citizen and do not accept Entrusted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What can you do to find a private detective? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White laughed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This thing only you can carry out. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a look around and continued:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to buy one that can be stolen A magical item of extraordinary ability. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard's eyes condensed, and he asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Emlin did not answer immediately, but looked around and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Sure enough, I was dragged into a dream with almost no awareness." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not in a hurry to get out of here, and took out the small badge from the "world" in the dignified face of Leonard Mitchell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard glanced at it, his expression relaxed a little, his head on his side, and paused for a few seconds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silently, Emlin White saw the scene disappearing and disappearing, as if one side of the glass was broken at the same time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard snorted In the house:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Come in and say. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
