			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Azick’s home, Klein returned to Daffodil Street in a public carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click, he took out the key to open the door and suddenly saw a figure sitting in the restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein subconsciously clenched his cane in his palm, but immediately awakened, it was not a thief, but a maid, Bella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bella is reading the newspapers spread out on the table intently, and hearing the sound of opening the door, she was shocked, brushed up, knotted Babadi explained: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, I just finished the morning, waiting, waiting for the water to boil and eat bread."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really didn’t adjust to the house and suddenly there was a maid... Klein laughed at herself, took off her hat, and nodded slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reading is a good habit, and it is encouraged by the goddess to keep reading after busy work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is afraid that the other person thinks that he It was mocking, so it was used in the name of the goddess of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in reality, only the god of knowledge and wisdom puts reading in a lofty position... Of course, no matter which church, it encourages learning... um, ten At the age of seven or eight, the goddess of the night, it is said that it is influenced by the parents, and such parents, as long as they are not completely unable to do so, will definitely let their daughters receive education, the public primary school can not afford to read, the church's free school is still no problem. At the most, I have time to rest... So, Bella is not illiterate, knows words, can read newspapers... Klein thoughtfully puts his cane into the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Bella, his impression is quite good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the little girl is not fit enough in the kitchen, she is clumsy, but she shows her willingness to learn and study hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bella drops his hands and is a little embarrassed to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to, before I haven't read the newspaper very much. Mr. Landlord doesn't allow us to buy old newspapers to paste the wall... I just picked it up and wiped the coffee table. I accidentally glanced at it and thought it was very interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor girl, I am going through the meeting, the newspapers are on the bottom of the interesting list... Klein whispered, smiled, followed the silver bracelet, took out the pocket watch, 啪I glanced at the floor and said casually: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you have completed your work and done well, you can freely arrange it at other times without stress. Of course, if I am chatting with Benson and Melissa, you'd better stay in your room. I will allow you to use the gas lamp inside and bring in some old newspapers."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, you knocked on the door of my bedroom at one o'clock in the afternoon, then prepared a cup of Xibo red for me. , two soft white bread, a piece of oatmeal toast, a small dish of cream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to celebrate his promotion sequence 8, Klein decided to be a little extravagant Put the white bread that Benson intends to enjoy on weekends to eat in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I will buy another 8 pounds, and the staple food will be changed from oatmeal bread to white bread! The extraordinary person of the sequence 8, the weekly salary will definitely rise... The captain did not mention this before... he forgot! Klein stunned and decided to ask tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, okay." Bella responded with surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she asked in some uncertain ways:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Klein, is entertaining Is your Xibo black tea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the family is Moretti, she uses the name to honor her name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, then it is the usual tea." Klein waved his hand and stepped toward the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After becoming a "clown", he suddenly found his financial situation very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is due to the fact that there is no extra, large expenditure for the time being, and it is also necessary to check the daily fixed 2 Sule rental carriage cost of the red chimney house, and occasionally The material is supplemented, while the latter is often reimbursed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is because Klein’s unregistered account is quietly squatting 300 pounds. You know, the country’s fields and pastures only need 5 to 6.5 sules per mu, that is, he can buy 920 to 1200 acres of rural fields or pastures, slightly equal to 137 to 179 acres on the earth, or 23 to 30 acres, in addition, this money allows him to buy a daffodil street for 15 years in the land lease period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all is converted into land, the rent of the rent is about 23 to 31 pounds per year...not bad, but it is not necessary now, this 300 pounds must be kept in emergency... ...call, I have to find a chance to tell my real weekly salary to Benson and Melissa in these two days! Klein wanted to enter his bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-locking the door, Klein sat down on the bed, once again began to meditate, in this way slowly control the little power of the potion spill, very careful, very cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For him, the loss of control was originally a noun that existed in words until the "peremptive" was encountered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he does not know the "peremptive", nor does he know what happened to him before, but only subconsciously thinks that it is a special case. It is rarely repeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like seeing a murder in another city from the news, the normal person will say a few more words, and he will forget when he turns around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Old Neil’s business has brought a great shock to Klein, and he clearly understands that out of control is around, just around, Losing control can come at any time in unexpected ways! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bloody lesson... Klein ended his meditation, opened his eyes and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he often dreams of the scene of the day, often wakes up in the middle of the night, cold and sweaty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is both saddened by the death of Old Neal and worried about his future. If there is no meditation to help sleep, he believes that he will often fall asleep lately. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to digesting the potions, try to control your emotions and desires so that they are within reasonable limits and not corroded by them..." Klein spit out the turbidity, lay down, and quickly entered deep sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the day of the death of Old Neal, Dunn’s performance and words gave him great touch, let him seriously examine the responsibility of the night-time person for the first time. I want to pick up my own burden as soon as possible to help the captain and teammates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, he does not intend to waste the afternoon time, the fighting practice course will be attended as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three o'clock in the afternoon, in the simple driving range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold short hair mottled high-texture wrinkles, watching Klein's movements become a little familiar from oysters, from familiarity to become a trainee who has received training for half a year. knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it all happened in just 40 minutes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shouted to practice, looked up and down, and couldn’t help but ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What happened?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has long thought of a set of rhetoric, ready to push its performance to scientific research, but Gao Wen’s voice just fell Immediately added to add: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is not convenient to answer, you do not need to answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It seems that the corresponding personnel of the police department have long passed with Gao Wen teacher... Also, he occasionally trains extraordinary people, how can he not be reminded in advance... Klein breathed a sigh of relief, ups and downs: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, how long do you think I need to participate in actual combat now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;高文环起起Hands and a serious look at him, the voice replied slightly and dumbly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two or three days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is not enough!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
