The only requirement is that you can't waste too much. Coffee powder, that is, I use my own coffee beans from the plateau to grind it by myself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Although Klein didn't understand too much, Neil wanted What to do, but still happily agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the other side to take out the copper key, open the iron door of the arsenal, and hear the long footsteps echoing inside, he slowly set the cup and confirmed the pot There is hot water in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncovering the lid of the silver tin can, Klein shakes a spoonful of coffee powder in two cups with a metal spoon Then pour hot water and stir well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——As a traversing person in the age of materialism, he is not strange to coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Klein thought for a moment, sat down, lifted his right leg, grabbed some dirt from the soles of his leather boots, and put Into the left cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he carefully stirred it again until the two cups of coffee were almost the same from the appearance color and the scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Old Neil took the keychain and walked out of the arsenal, slamming the iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get it done." His slightly murky dark red eyes turned and looked at Klein across the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil laughed and sat down while untied the silver chain wrapped around his wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expression quickly became quiet, the left hand held the chain to extend, let the silver chain hang vertically on the coffee cup on the right side of it, that Pure white crystals are almost contaminated with liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a relaxed tranquility, the white crystal inexplicably had a slight swing, with a silver chain to make a small counterclockwise movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This cup is a bad thing." Old Neil said in a positive tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Klein’s confirmation, he took the silver chain and picked up the coffee next to it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you like to drink bitter coffee? I am used to a spoonful of sugar and a spoonful of milk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not answer, asked with a strong interest :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your divination results are accurate, depends on that white crystal? Is it white crystal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the divination method in Divination, also known as the spirit pendulum method, relying on the connection between its own star spirit and the spiritual world, the starry sky, with some natural materials and spiritual communication, such as crystal, gemstones and special metals. Let's go to the divination thing... Let's go back to the two cups of coffee just now, swing counterclockwise to bad, clockwise as well, not move is bad or bad. You can also write the event on paper, pay attention It’s an event, not a problem.” Old Neil put down his coffee cup and explained in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein seems to be thinking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, don't use questionable statements?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, can't use 'who, who is willing to be my fiancée', use 'who is willing to be my fiancee', write it on paper Put it on the table, then use the non-dominant hand to hold the pendulum chain. Note that it is a non-dominant hand.” Old Neil laughed. “At this time, straighten the arm and adjust the length of the pendulum so that the crystal just falls on the paper. Just above, almost touched the events we wrote, then closed our eyes, silently recited the words seven times in my heart, silently finished, opened my eyes, and saw if the spirit pendulum was turning. If not, I closed it again and repeated the previous process. Until there is a swing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded slightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Counterclockwise 'No', clockwise 'is'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It can also be interpreted as not smooth and smooth." Old Neil corrected it and taught Klein the other uses and details of the divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein recollected it several times and found it to be a very useful divination technique. For example, in an unfamiliar environment, you can use it to quickly confirm whether the food is toxic and does not require additional "Point" "field biology" and other skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this form of divination is too simple, and there are only two or three answers that can’t be explored and interpreted in depth, such as something It is harmful, but after a certain treatment, it can become very beneficial. For example, some ingredients are really harmful to the human body, but they are not serious. In the case of starvation, there is not much problem in eating and eating. Can not be judged by the spirit pendulum method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to pay for crystal or sterling silver as soon as possible to make the spirit..." Klein sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil looked at him with amazement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can apply directly, this It belongs to the extraordinary, especially the standard equipment of the extraordinary type of our auxiliary type, there is a citrine and a sterling silver spirit in the arsenal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But I am not a full member of the team..." Klein was so hearted and hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil chuckles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the extraordinary, whether it is a full member, Since you don't raise your salary, you must definitely give some convenience from other aspects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may be more appropriate to use 'welfare', I will apply to the captain after waiting! Klein made a decision by secretly making a fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I know if the captain agrees without trying? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Old Neil smiled. "We started the formal 'mystery course', one of its foundations is called 'symbol', knowing what Is it a 'symbol'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein recalls the words he has heard before and what he sees and hears in the spirit world, above the fog, Said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter the spirit world, or the illusory starry sky, and those unknown areas, are outside our senses, not the ears, nose and eyes. The information can be accurately described. What we get is only the unspeakable visual revelation and experience. They are also expressed as abstract symbols and graphic symbols. These symbols represent different meanings of different things."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very accurate, it's a 'divination'." Old Neil nodded solemnly. "Only by mastering the ability to interpret symbols, can you really enter the door of occultism, um, The pattern on the tarot card, every element on the pattern, is a symbol. A prescribed symbol to help us understand and interpret the original 'revelation'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a piece of paper, picked up the pen next to it, drew a note Long arc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed, he added a few vertical lines under the arc and looked up at Klein Road:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what this symbol represents?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked and looked, for a moment he hesitated and said:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eyelash?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Old Neil sighed. "This is the harvest constellation." Symbol, this is the thunder constellation, this is the hoarfrost constellation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has drawn several symbolic symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein couldn’t help but whisper as he remembered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The names of these constellations, Really, it’s really pristine, right, simple!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good locality...{br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old Neil smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same was true of Russell the Great. He always intended to change the name of the constellation to Virgo, Cancer, and Scorpio. Unfortunately, he still failed to counter the power of tradition, at least the ancient names of these constellations and the dates of their respective representatives. Can guide the cultivation and guide the harvest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to say that Russell is an idea." Klein did not know how to vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Russell was supposed to be an individual in his life...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil could not understand Klein's humor continues to explain various basic symbols, such as the various constellations, such as the Sun, Red Moon, Brown Star, Red Star, and Blue Star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he talked about this, he interspersed with the paintings and precautions that taught the divination disk, the production of crystal balls and the choice of materials and mantras. Klein has almost a stunned feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he found that the "Divination" potion had a small increase in his memory, he had already stopped the old Neil to facilitate his own digestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today's 'mystery course' is here, you think about it yourself, you can come to me if you have any questions." Old Neil took out a piece of gold The pocket watch, glanced openly, "Don't forget to read the historical materials I prepared for you. Frankly speaking, I feel scared when I see them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Okay." Klein took the old Neil to write the signed drafts, and quickly passed the mysterious knowledge he learned today, so as not to be obviously forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil sipped his re- brewed coffee track:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Memory can't be used, it must be used frequently, so that knowledge can be turned into your instinct. Also, meditation must be carried out every day. Only by practicing more and using it can you truly grasp the power of the potion and unearth its hidden mystery. The bad influence is lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling this, Klein remembered playing, remembered the divination club, and tried to say:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My potion's ability is related to divination. It is impossible to practice by one person alone. It is necessary to contact a large number of people and give them divination in order to master them as soon as possible. I intend to have extra. Money, go to join the 'Divination Club', the one on the Halls Street in the North District, and be a true 'diviner'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing In the future, it will definitely not be worth the night, it is better to lay aside in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your thoughts are very similar to Dai Li. She always said to be a real 'psychic'. Daniel shook his head and smiled." Why wait until you have extra money to go? You can write an application to Dunn and let him approve the fee! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Organizations such as 'Divination Club' may be mixed with members of cultists and evil organizations. You are a civilian member of the Night Squad, the standard extraordinary." , join them, easy to monitor, is the need of work! We used to inspect these places regularly, just because there are not enough people, it is difficult to track them for a long time, and now it is just for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this kind of operation? Looking at the old expression of the old Neil, Klein was shocked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bright and straightforward reason to reimburse yourself for private expenses!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am ignorant of similar things...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am really just a keyboard powerhouse...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to do this with your own money? "Old Neil saw it and smiled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately shook his head and replied firmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I will report to the captain when I wait! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil is satisfied with the dagger and looks at the cup of coffee that has not been dumped and has something bad:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you put in it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled embarrassedly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just, just the soles of leather boots A little bit of sludge, its color is about the same as your coffee powder. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
