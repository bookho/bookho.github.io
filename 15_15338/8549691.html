			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Klein’s question, the beautiful lady with long brown hair and elegant hair did not have an impatient expression at all, and she kept a polite smile:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our members are free to help people in the club to divination and determine the price themselves, we only draw a very low percentage of fees, if you want to divination, you can look at this picture Book, there are introductions and prices for members who are willing to divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, today is Monday afternoon, most of our members are working They are all busy, only less than five come..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, while Klein sat down on the sofa in the reception hall by the window, then Open the book on the opposite side and point out the current membership in the club: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hainas Vansente, famous fortune teller in Tingen, resident club Tutor, good at all kinds of divination, charge 4 Sule per time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;好贵...... Make me and Benson, Melissa eat two meals a hearty dinner ...... Klein secretly speechless, I do not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman with a brownish-brown appearance sees the page and continues to page backwards: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"...The last one, Glacis, who has just joined the club this year, has mastered Tarot Divination, charging 2 pence each time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Mr., which one do you want to choose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has no polite answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mr. Glacis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The beautiful lady in charge of reception was silent for two seconds. "Sir, I must remind you in advance, Gera Mr. Sith can only be a beginner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand, I am responsible for my decision." Klein smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Please follow me." The beautiful lady got up and led Klein into the gate next to the reception hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a corridor that is not too long, and the open meeting room is full of sunshine, tables and chairs, newspapers, magazines, and cards. Waiting for things, the faint smell of coffee floats out of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there are two rooms in the conference room, the beautiful lady in charge of the reception signaled that Klein stopped and stepped up, stepped into the end, and shouted softly. One voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Gracies, someone is looking for your divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I? A voice full of surprises and doubts immediately rang, accompanied by the movement of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, which divination room do you want to use?" Pretty lady answered with no emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The citrine room, I like citrine." Glacis appeared at the door of the conference room, curiously looking forward to Klein waiting not far away. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a 30-year-old man with darker complexion, dark green pupils, yellowish and soft hair, white shirt, black vest, chest Hanging the pair of monocles, the temperament is quite good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful lady in charge of the reception did not say much, opened the "Citrine" room next to the conference room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtains inside are closed and the light is dim. It seems that only in this way can God and Spirit revel and obtain accurate divination results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, I am Glacis, I didn't think you would pick me up for your divination." Glacis saluted in a gentleman's way. Stepping into the room, sitting behind the long table, "Frankly speaking, I just tried to divination, there is no rich experience. For the time being, I am not a good diviner, you have the opportunity to repent. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Klein returned to the ceremony, he followed the door and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are an honest gentleman, but I am a person who insists on my choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please sit down." Glacis pointed to the opposite Position, thought for a few seconds, "Divination is just my hobby, huh, huh, people often get the guidance of the gods in their lifetime, but ordinary people can not accurately interpret the meaning of the Lord, this is the meaning of divination, but also I join this The reason for the club. In this respect, I still don't have enough confidence in myself. We will be the next divination. It is a communication, free communication. How about this proposal? The cost of giving the club is borne by myself. One penny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t say anything, didn’t shake his head, and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"It can be seen that you have a good, decent job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, his body leans forward slightly, his right hand clenches his fist against the forehead , tapped twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this does not improve the accuracy of my divination." Glacius replied humorously, asking indulgently, "Do you have a headache? Want to divination about health issues? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A little bit, I hope that the divination is the whereabouts of an item." Klein had long thought about the words, and the body slowly leaned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his eyes, Glacis's body is clearly visible, the orange color of the lungs is dull and thin, and affects the rest of the brightness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a tired performance... Klein is invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for lost items?" Glacis thought for a few seconds. "Then we make a simple decision."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed the neatly stacked tarot cards on the black desktop to Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calm down, in Recalling the item in my heart, meditating on the question of 'can I find it', at the same time, shuffling and cutting cards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Ryan didn't really remember the old notes. He could only expand the question he needed to meditate: Can you still find the notes of the Antignus family? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the repetition, he skillfully completed the shuffling and cutting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grassis picked up one from the top and pushed it to the front of Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Turn it clockwise into vertical, then open it. If it is a reverse position, that is, the pattern on the card is facing you, it means that the item can't be found. If it is in the right position, then we will continue the divination. Find the specific whereabouts of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein followed the prompts to turn the horizontally placed cards to the vertical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed the edge of this tarot card and turned it over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a reversed card with a reversed pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately." Glacis sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not respond because his attention was on the tarot card in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pattern on this retrograde card is the "fool" wearing gorgeous clothes and wearing a smashed headpiece! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is the "fool"? It won't be so clever... According to the "inverted man" and the old Neil, divination is the result of spiritual and spiritual world, and with the higher level of "I", Tarot is only a convenient interpretation of "symbolic revelation" The tool, in theory, does not matter what divination items are used, it does not affect the results... Klein frowned slightly and thought about it for a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Can you divinate that item has been obtained by someone else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly, follow the same way, come back again." Glacis is very strong. Nodding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein reshuffles, cuts cards, and meditates on issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a breath, Klein reached out and opened the tarot card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not be a "fool" again...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mood of prayer, he suddenly Relax, because the face is presented as a "star", reverse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the item has not been picked up by others." Glacis smiled and explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded, raised his right hand, and tapped his eyebrows twice, then took two pennies with dark brass from his trouser pocket. , pushed to Glacis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't mean to be free?" Glacis frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and got up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is respect for divination."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, thank you for your generosity." Glacis stood up and reached out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a handshake, Klein stepped back two steps, turned his body, walked to the door, and twisted the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was about to go out, he suddenly turned back, "Hmm" a voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gera Mr. Sith, I suggest that you look at the doctor as soon as possible, mainly in the lungs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Glacis asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the result of dissatisfaction with divination, cursing me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a symptom seen from the face, You, um, your eyebrows are black."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The eyebrows are black..." Glacis was the first to hear a similar description. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t explain it anymore, smiled and walked out of the room and closed the wooden door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is he an unlicensed doctor, or a local pharmacist?" Glacis smiled and shook his head, picking up the silver mirror for divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a closer look and found that his eyebrows were really black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is an environmental problem. Under the dim light of the curtains, he is black and his face is black! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A less funny joke." Glacis whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not too confident to divination himself for health, confirming that there is no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving the Divination Club, Klein has an additional plan for the future . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to save money as soon as possible, pay the annual fee, become a member of the club, and thus start to play the so-called "divination". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why don’t you go it alone, because there is no resources, no channels, and it’s impossible to go to the street to be a street vendor. After all, it’s a personal face and a face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, he waited for the public carriage, spent 2 pence, and arrived at Zouteland Street, which was not too far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the door of the "Black Thorns Security Company", he did not see the familiar brown-haired girl, only found the poet, temperament, black and green Nad Mitchell sat behind the reception desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Rosanne?" asked Klein after taking off his hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard smiled and pointed to the door:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is the arsenal tonight ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
