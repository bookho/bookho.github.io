			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinctive wide chin, the bun of the ancient knight, with cold and smiling eyes... Hugh Dilcha half-sitting on the sofa Carefully study the sketch given by Audrey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her eyes, this is the living, golden pound that can move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After deep into the mind of the great pirate Zilingers, she read the additional description:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brown hair, dark green eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Portraits are only for reference, because the target has the ability to change into the appearance of others, duration Unknown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portraits are only for reference... Goals can be transformed into others... just for reference, to transform others... then why should I memorize the sketch content so carefully? ... Hugh’s expression is sluggish and seems to feel the malice of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She confused and looked up and looked at the opposite couch, Firth Wall, talking to herself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no way to find it. I don't know what it looks like. I only know that it is a foreigner. The number of foreigners who come to Bakerland every day is simply not countable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falth's waist is hard, want to sit up, can try three times, all failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am just an apprentice, not an arbitrator..." She muttered and reached for the back of the sofa, successfully changing from lying to sitting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The lady may think we are the prophet?" Foers made a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh is about to answer, and suddenly found that there are still many additional descriptions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She whispered out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is recommended to look for:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1. There is a sinister object in Qilingus, every other day will devour the flesh and soul of a living person, considering the missing tramp. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2. Collect detailed information about Qieringus and summarize his unique hobbies and behavior patterns. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"3. A person's facial features may change, but as long as he has not been specially trained, he will always behave like himself, such as favorite food. Walking style, habitual movements, and more details. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls heard a slight sigh: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Audrey is not like Rumor is such a simple and innocent girl, she has a delicate inner and calm observation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? "Hugh is not too convinced to ask a question, did not expect to answer and instead propose, "I am responsible for collecting information, you sum up the pile of gold pounds, no, the pirate general's hobbies and characteristics? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folth's eyes wide open, shaking the iron box in his hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "How do you bear it? How can you bear to let a delicate and sensitive writer do this summary and analyze the reasoning? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a glimpse of a friend, unconsciously revealing a convincing majesty:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You There is a very good reasoning content in "Storm Mountain Villa". "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folsh shrinks his shoulders, lowers his head, and looks at the coffee table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Do you know how many hairs I lost for that reasoning, how many times have I lost sleep? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly looked up and saw Hugh Dilcha, then continued to bury her head and muttered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Life is very short, there are too many things to do, why should we waste such tedious work?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes a lot of sense... It’s a little nod to take a break, and it’s hard to maintain the majesty of the “arbitrator.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have any other way to solve this problem?" She pressed her throat and made the tender voice low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls seriously thought for ten seconds and jerked up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can Please ask the professionals to do it! After collecting the information of 'Hurricane Lieutenant', we erased the name, took it to find a good detective, asked him to help summarize and reason, and only need to pay the consulting fee!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t think of it... Hugh’s mind was blank, and Firth looked at me, I saw you, no one spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the atmosphere became a little embarrassing, she cleared her throat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow your proposal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she added another sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The consultation fee is up to you!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horse Street, Divination club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon, Mr. Moretti." The beautiful lady, Angelica, who was in charge of the hospitality, looked at the surprise and said, "You rarely come over on Friday." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to check the red chimney houses, Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Destiny will not repeat itself, always bring us some accidents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just passed by here, the hire time of the rental carriage is also here, so come up to drink Lipstick tea, take a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, this is his last time, and with the new Divination Club “experience”, he will logically file a special application with Dunn Smith. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your words are always full of philosophies." Angelica praised sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought for a moment and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I may come very rarely in the future Club, you don't need to recommend me to others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the potion is digested, he has to move toward the new goal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Angelica said with surprise and confusion. "You are already very famous in the club. Most people know that your divination is very accurate. Magical, we are even considering asking you to be a lecturer on Sunday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is 1 pound for each divination, then I will be tired and bite again. ...and I still run a few houses with red chimneys, trying to get out the behind-the-scenes hand as soon as possible... Klein gently laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Don't stay, this is the fate of the arrangement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't come to the club anymore, just reduce the frequency, my membership fee will be paid as scheduled." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I can reimburse... I will occasionally come over and monitor it here... Klein silently added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a shame. I hope that when I am confused, you can come to the club.” Angelica sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the initial horror, she found that she was not as surprised as this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the mystery of such awe-inspiring destiny is not a long-term possession of a club in Tingen... Angelica seems to smile like a thought: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xibo Black Tea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Klein smiled back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat in the club for ten minutes, took a break, drank black tea, left here, and took the railroad public carriage back to Daffodil Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he entered the door, he used to open the mailbox and saw a letter that was just delivered soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
