			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has withdrawn from the heavy safes and waited until he noticed that there was nothing wrong with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The white bone statue is very sinister...not dangerous, but it is also inexplicably flustered... Is it the so-called 'original witch'? 'The hidden sage', 'the dark side of the universe', the 'real creator' and the evil spirit?" Klein thought of his own guess of Mrs. Shelen, and suddenly realized which existence of the white bone statue might represent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he thought, the spirituality suddenly touched and a bad hunch emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was busy flying to the complicated window, looking out the road outside the house, only seeing a carriage in the light of the gas light, fast and steady Drive to the main entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Shelen is back? In his heart, he figured out the source of the crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that Terry became a female after the sequence 8 "teacher", it is likely to belong to sequence 7, and Mrs. Shelen is active in Tingen The upper social circle of the city has also been around for a few years, and the high probability of Bitlis is stronger. Klein did not dare to take advantage of the "Yangyan Charms" and "Azick Copper Whistle" adventures, and rationally decided to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because the former has a limit on the number of one, and one less one, and once again deceived the "variant sun emblem" this seal does not know what to wait for Time is not a critical moment. There is no other way. Klein does not want to waste, and will face problems afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t always say to Dunn, just happened to have a good-hearted strongman passing by, just help me? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why the "Azick copper whistle" is not used, because Klein is not sure whether the "messenger" summoned has combat power, in case everyone is just fascinating Will only send a letter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the things I just discovered, it’s enough for the night team to be dispatched. Why do I have to single-handedly with Mrs. Shelen? It’s obvious that she can marry her!” Klein emphasized in his heart that he ended his call and returned to the fog, then wrapped himself in spirituality and fell back into the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly extinguished and put away the candle, lifted the spiritual wall, and flashed out of Mrs. Shelen’s bedroom, returning according to the original route, but it was no time to The latch of the balcony door is restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sliding down the water pipe, turning out of the garden from the opposite wall of the main entrance, Klein has been lurking to the next block, before taking the expensive night rental carriage to Zoart Lan Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black dress is becoming more and more beautiful, Mrs. Xue Lun is slowly returning On the second floor, I sent the maid and unscrewed the door of my bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She’s pure and hydrated eyelids condense, showing a nearly transparent, invisible filament that is not spiritual. Glorious, like the human hair of a diseased person, if you don't know the existence of these things in advance, or have very special eyes, no one can find them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, all the filaments are broken and fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Shelen’s eyes narrowed and she turned her eyes to the heavy iron-gray safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 36 Zouteland Street, Blackthorn Security Company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn, who is swaying his legs and reading the newspaper leisurely, looks awkwardly at Klein, who appears at the door of his office, silently sighing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you not trying to sneak into Mrs. Shelen’s home tonight for a preliminary search?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"...Is the problem solved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein Zheng’s focus:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Members of the Witch Denomination?" Dunn put down the newspaper, chewed the phrase, and asked seriously, "What did you find?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not sit down, Leaning forward, hands on the edge of the desk:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I first saw a photo of a young man, but like Mrs. Shelen. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he changes to women's wear, makeup, beauty and PS, it is slightly equal to what Mrs. Shelen is now... Klein can't help it. I spit in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it similar to ‘teacher’ Teres?” Dunn’s ashes flashed, and it’s awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have previously judged that Terry is likely to be a member of the Witch Denomination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Klein felt more complicated and turned his head and said, "I later used my divination skills to discover Mrs. Shelen in my dreams. There is a white bone statue in the mezzanine of the safe. It is a glamorous woman, but the hair grows to the ankle, the root is thick like a viper, and the top has eyes, quite strange, captain, is this the image of the 'original witch'? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the level of confidentiality is not enough, there is very little information about the witch sects he can see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun recalled a bit, and looked at it with dignity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the original witch 'The image.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We must act now to control Mrs. Shelen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein immediately echoed: "Well, if Mrs. Shelen is the extraordinary sequence of the witch sect, then I don't think she will notice that someone has sneaked into her bedroom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he suddenly raised a doubt and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, why the seven orthodox gods have no specific image, only Instead of the symbolic symbol, the evil spirits that I am currently exposed to have the appearance of a humanoid. The 'real creator' is like this. The same is true of the 'original witch'. Is this one of the differences between the god and the evil spirit?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there such a difference? Klein silently added a question, but wisely did not say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the difference between the god and the evil spirit." Dunn gave a positive answer, then got up and walked to the coat rack. "We can't delay any more." I am worried that Mrs. Shelen will abscond."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, Dunnton has a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You go to Cohenli, we three people act, this can apply for a seal, Mrs. Schellen is likely to be more than sequence 7."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, you Really wise! Klein replied without hesitation: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he Curiously asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, which seal do you want to use?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Dunn recalled and considered for more than a dozen seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"3—0217.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because there weren't many seals behind the Chanis Gate in Tingen, Klein quickly remembered what the captain wanted to apply for:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" :0217."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Name: The mirror of the psychic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hazard rating: '3', there is a certain danger, need to be used with care, only three or more actions can be applied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Privacy level: full members of the night and above. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Description: The mirror is covered with mercury on the back and there are three small cracks on the front.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Investigators who first contacted looked at the mirror When I saw a long-haired, weeping woman inside, he found that the woman had climbed out of the mirror."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to many experiments The image reflected by the mirror is different most of the time. Even if the same person repeatedly watches it, it will encounter different things, and the level of danger will be different, but they will all be given priority to those who look in the mirror."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most dangerous situation is to see yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If no one takes this mirror, there is Under the premise of light, it automatically emerges an image every three hours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It does not have a living feature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Appendix: This mirror originally belonged to a psychic, a very ordinary mirror, until one day, the psychic It is suspicious to commit suicide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, after the Chanis Gate in Tingen, there are not many seals that can be used to fight between extraordinary people. "3-0217" is a good choice... Klein did not say more, immediately ran to the night entertainment room, shouting "sleeper" Cohen Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Tonight, Loyola turns Chaneys Gate, Leonard rests, Siga. Te An patrols Rafael Cemetery and other places, new members It is only possible to arrive on Sunday, so Dunn can only choose one of Frye and Cohen Li. Considering that Mrs. Shelen belongs to the witch sect, it has little to do with the Necromancer. He chose the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Dunn returned from the ground with a mirror wrapped in a thick black cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, it’s not known in advance, I can’t tell if it’s a mirror, it’s not exposed anywhere... Klein and the little Cohenri Welcomed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are responsible for using the seal '3-0217'." Dunn handed the mirror to Cohenli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Klein suddenly realized that he is the extraordinary person of Sequence 8, and has the strength of frontal combat, can no longer hide to the side to do simple assistance It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, a little nervous...He touched the "Sleep Charm" in his pocket and confirmed that he was ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only problem is that I didn't bring a cane to facilitate climbing. Well, I can borrow Cohenli. He has a pistol in his hand, enough." Klein had a lot of thoughts, and the three came downstairs and took a rental carriage to Olsna Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, Cohenli looked at the seal in the palm of his hand, "3-0217", and said with a slight tension:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my first time to participate in such a dangerous operation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, the night event will not use the seal when dealing with extraordinary events Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——When I went to the town of Morse to solve the spiritual event, applying for the “variant sun emblem” was a small probability accident, because the distance was too far. Rescue is definitely too late, and this time, the goal is almost certain to be the extraordinary of the sequence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry, maybe Mrs. Shelen has run away." Klein smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, his tension is no less than that of Cohen Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng’s ashes turned around and looked at him helplessly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't let Mrs. Shelen run away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 20 minutes later The three night-timers arrived at Olsna Street and saw the garden in the darkness and the house of Mrs. Shelen. They quietly squatted there, as if nothing had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
