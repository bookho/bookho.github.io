			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, although I don’t need it, I can give Su Shi, I can use it to exchange other extraordinary materials... Hey, Su Shi’s potion is still bad. The spinal fluid of the Farsman rabbit... Some things are handed over to Su Shi, which is much more convenient than myself. Every "big detective" needs a good assistant, ah! Audrey made a quick decision. For her, this is not something that she is particularly concerned about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's put down the telegram, her pleasure is precipitated, and the real troubles gradually emerge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still owe the information of the "Folly" Mr. Might, the task of assassinating Ambassador Intis, and a request from his deaf... I finally realized It’s the feeling of carrying a heavy debt... Audrey, can’t delay any more! Get started! The girl quietly grasped her fist and tried to find a pen and paper and write a letter to the Viscount of Glylint, let him arrange for himself to meet with Hugh and Firth as soon as possible and entrust the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pen was lifted and the ink was stained. Audrey suddenly hung the wrist and did not write. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just thought of a very important question, that is, she has very little understanding of the Intis ambassador Baker, in which case it is easy to be wrong. Judging the difficulty, either you can't find someone who is willing to accept the commission, or you are entrusted to an unsuitable object, so that the task will face failure at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the price of inflation, it is not the focus of her attention. She believes that Mr. Fool’s reward will be better and help himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indulge in a moment, Audrey turned to the maid Anne Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell Jia Liya Countess, I accept the invitation, and I will attend her ball on time tomorrow night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia Liya is the wife of Earl Wolff, her upcoming ball invitation The ambassadors of various countries in Lun, including Becker Jean Jean Madan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey originally wanted to use her illness as an excuse to push it off, but now she is interested in the dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I watched Ambassador Baker Lang, I collected enough information to meet with Hugh and Firth! Audrey suddenly had a kind of participation in the big event, and began to dream about the excitement of an adventure career! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital of the Rhodes Islands, "The City of Generosity" Byam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the real world, Alger Wilson changed the flamboyant clothing of the Republic of Intis, entering the alley from the back door of the hotel and bypassing a few street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped in front of a house without a garden and lawn and took out a common white hard shell mask on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he reached out and knocked on the door, three light and two light, and the interval was two long and three short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a dozen seconds, the door slammed open, and a man with a pirate turban swept his head and quickly watched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in." The man let the road open and said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger did not speak and walked quietly into the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 Minsk Street, Klein opens the curtains and sits at the desk before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information of the secret service given by the "downside down" made him aware that the target is likely to have a certain connection with the Republic of Intis, and at the same time, he associates The description of the Antigonus family before the "downside down" was "distinct" and "terrible". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last night I used iron black nematodes to sneak into my room, the extraordinary person who peeked at the information and left a warning was really a bit strange... the Antignus family mastered The sequence chain is exactly the "divination" approach of the Secret Society. The two can be equated... that is, you can make such a guess. Last night, the extraordinary person was a part-time inspector of the Intis Republic. Or not in the secret meeting, but with the help of the Republic of Intis and the close association, got the corresponding formula and potion? Klein began to make bold assumptions and carefully verified:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can explain my 'clown' hunch that didn't work when the strange ironworm invasion, which stems from the suppression of me by the higher sequence of the same route... Of course, there are also iron black nematodes that do not actually threaten me. Reason..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The same can explain why I just wrote Ian Wright's intelligence, and there was iron black nematode sneak into the night, and Go straight to the desk... The ability of the other person to have a 'divination' will make things reasonable enough..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After repeated scrutiny, Klein felt that his guess was very likely Close to the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is indeed a higher sequence of the 'Divination' approach, he will be a sequence, what is the name of the potion? Can manipulate the iron black nematode, Is it another giant of the circus, the animal trainer?" Klein is half-self-deprecating and half-shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps my follow-up potion formula will be obtained from him... This is what I meant by the divination I gained before. Beckland, really a "land of hope"... Kline said a few words and began to think about what to do next:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assassination of Intis Ambassador Becker, the task of completely eradicating hidden dangers, he has already entrusted him to go out, he must have to avoid suspicion, and he does not have that ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaking Ian Wright’s whereabouts to both sides, he believed that Ambassador Becker had no time to retaliate against himself and would not add any additional trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding the very important items in his mouth is obviously the thing he cares most about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, before that item is found, I am safe, don't rush to hire a powerful extraordinary bodyguard... well, even after retaliation It is impossible for the ambassador to ask the high-ranking strong to deal with me. This is neither economic nor necessary. After all, Beckland is not his home..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The biggest possibility is that it is still handed over to the extraordinary person who used the iron black nematode to sneak into my room last night. He is at least 7 in sequence, maybe even in sequence 6, sequence 5, has enough strength and is familiar with the situation... I will follow the time. This standard is good for bodyguards... I hope that before this, the ambassador will never be able to give orders..." Klein looked out of the window and finally dissipated the fog, feeling like a daze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to continue to the "Brave Bar" tonight, this is to use Kaspers to contact other extraordinary people, to lay the foundation for the selection of appropriate bodyguards The second is to find opportunities to sell Mercer's extraordinary characteristics, to collect some funds, and the third is to see if anyone sells amazing magical items to enhance their own strength. This is a plan that will never be outdated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming the idea, Klein pretended to look at the newspaper leisurely, waited until the sky turned black, and then slowly got up and made a tomato oxtail for himself. soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having enough to eat, he routinely pulled the curtains on the bedroom and decided not to open it tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he summoned himself, responded to himself, and became a special spirit, Aziz copper whistle, Merle above the fog Sophie's characteristics, self-made spells, various materials and tarot cards have moved back to the real world, leaving only a few items such as blood-stained contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this and getting the right things, Klein’s strength has returned to the peak and once again become a half occult expert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collar was sorted out. He took a hat and a cane and left the 15th Minsk Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiemen Street, "Brave Bar". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who switched to a message with a beer, found Casper in a card room, and the other party bet while playing " fighting evil" A boxer outside is quite comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This familiar environment made Klein think of the last time he met and a dozen living corpses playing Maric in Texas, and suddenly thanked himself for not taking Azick before. Copper whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I was carrying the bronze whistle given by Mr. Azick, it was estimated that the dozens of living corpses of Maric would be rebellious on the spot, and hospitality "entertained" I... I don't know what expression he would be... Klein stood by the door and nodded to Casper Kanlining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspars covered the cards and sweared, got up and walked to the door, pressing down the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
