			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, Klein continues to write:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The essence of solving the potion problem is digestion Instead of mastering, this can be understood intuitively."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, just use the power of the potion as an external tool, tame beast, no matter how mastered No matter how skilled they are, they still don't really belong to themselves. The risk of counter-phasing is greater, and digestion is to treat the potion as a part of itself, break it down, fuse it, absorb it, and unite with each other as a whole." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no doubt about this, the key is why 'playing' can help digestion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Based on today's divination experience, make two guesses and wait for further verification."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One, according to the 'play' of the potion name, Can change the state of body, mind, and spirit, let them gradually close to the stubborn spirit remaining in the core of the potion, thus generating resonance, a little assimilation, one Point absorption."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Second, the stubborn spirit of the core of the potion is like a well-defended computer host. If you want to invade it, break it, disintegrate it, You must find the BUG, ​​find the loophole, find the key, and the name of the potion reveals the corresponding clues, so you can play the role, reconcile your body, mind, and spirit, disguise yourself as a 'self-person', deceive the 'guardian', and sway into it. This idea is similar to the description of Russell the Great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what kind of guess, the state of body, mind, and spirit is an element that cannot be bypassed." After all, they are the only bridge between 'playing' and potion power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein put down the pen and read the text again, for a moment Thanks to the exam-oriented education given by the Big Eater Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what, regardless of whether you have chosen science, you have chosen engineering, the basic logic is still available, otherwise there is no way to become a keyboard strong, no way Conduct such analysis and guessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The play may be really effective, and the specific changes are to be observed." Klein made a phased summary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he wrote the second question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One makes people feel weird The description, why is the 'divination' more eloquent and more professional in the field of occultism, there will be no direct means of defeating the enemy? Is it not the erudition and professionalism that should make the 'divination' more powerful, and more able to find ways to defeat the enemy?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason for the analysis is as follows:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first, just like the previously seen web In the same way, I have entered the game world that has become a reality. Therefore, different 'professions' must have their own characteristics and are relatively balanced. But so far, no signs of dataization have been found, and there is no task-oriented development. Temporarily suspended, it may be extremely low."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Second, the underlying rule of the world is balance, and the Creator created this with balance as the core."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third, the same sequence of potions at the same energy level, this is the ancestors The best state discovered after the discovery and summarization, beyond this level, it is easy to collapse and get out of control, too low below this level, and can not get the extraordinary power that you want, so in the case of a certain level of energy, on the one hand, a little stronger, On the other hand, it will naturally be weaker."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fourth kind, the homologue of all things, is differentiated from the Creator, and belongs to the creator of the Creator. The potential meaning of complementing each other is that there are problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The current trend is the third and fourth reasons, but the latter comes from the myth of uncertainty. , can only be used as a reference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First guided by the third, through the current learning and subsequent findings to verify."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Klein has written a full two pages, but he has not stopped, and has written a new question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"From today's study, my 'transportation ceremony' is a typical ritual magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Similar ritual magic can be divided into three parts, the first one is to please or to the part of the sacrifice that corresponds to the interest, the second is to describe the part of the specific prayer object, the third is to get What is the essential part of the help, which needs to be clarified with the corresponding language of the formatting and certain symbolic symbols. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From this point of view, analyzing the 'transportation ceremony', can find an obvious problem, there is no third part!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has a staple food, counterclockwise The four-step squared part of the sacrifice also has the part of the mantra that points to the prayer, such as Fusheng Xuanhuang Xianzun, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But its follow-up is only closed Waiting, did not describe the purpose of the ritual is transshipment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, this so-called 'transportation ceremony' wants to pray for something, the corresponding existence is not at all Clearly, you can only play freely... Free to play..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The pit 爹! The "Qin Han secret essays" TM is too pitted?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My brain must have been in the water, I will think about it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Klein stopped the pen and took two breaths, trying to calm himself down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, he spit out the turbidity and continues to comb: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Consider the redesign of the ceremony, Let it be complete, and the goal of praying is to return to the earth and return to the world where parents and relatives are located."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the question is coming, what is the existence? Is it not free to play? Or does it imply a deeper purpose?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Further, descriptive mantras point on the earth, and in this world Is the person pointing to the same existence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If yes, the difference between the first and second ceremonies can be explained as free play, The second and third time can go to the fog, can connect 'justice' and 'downside man', there is almost no difference, then what is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the fourth ritual of tomorrow afternoon proves that it can be repeated stably, it means that the effect is solidified, which means that the goal of praying is implicit in me. Clearly, in this way, adding new descriptions and new prayers will not have a clear response, or even make the ceremony confusing and produce bad results."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The difference between the first and the following, in the case of insisting that the object does not change, does it mean that the world will cause a difference in response? Just like using different interfaces..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you design to achieve the effect I want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you think it's the first time Unlike the existence of the following two points, some of the previous problems can be fully explained, but the same, the second and third stability and invariance mean the implied goal, and the change is temporarily impossible." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The most critical point, who is the existence of the point, where is He, how can I not hint and guide me?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is deep in the foggy world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, is not it can be used as a sleeping His presence, given a certain stimulus, there is a fixed obtain feedback, in addition to, and not interfere and affect me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That can be designed with different rituals to stimulate, to summarize the rules of feedback, and finally find the right return method." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the problem is that if He does not sleep, then all temptations can lead to terrible things, very dangerous. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first temptation must be careful enough to avoid irritating design..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It's really a headache, and it needs further study. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sighed and gave a conclusion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, he was scattered again Scattered something else:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is always an invisible voice echoing in the ear, shouting Hornachs and, um, the pronunciation is Freigra Or Ferrega? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honakis is a mountain range across the Kingdom of Lun and the Republic of Intis, with its main peak of more than six kilometers. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
