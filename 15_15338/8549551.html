What should be the ability to take the 'Divination' potion?" Dunn Smith shook his head and smiled. The ashes and faces were all facing the red moon, hidden in the shadows. "Astrology, card divination, spiritual pendulum, spiritual vision and similar many things, of course, not that you serve Under the potion, you immediately understand and master them. The potion only gives you the qualifications and ability to learn these."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the lack of direct means of confrontation Oh, you should be able to imagine that ritual magic requires too much preparation and is not suitable for encounters. Therefore, in terms of occult knowledge, 'Divination' will be more knowledgeable and professional than 'Peaceful'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds quite right for me...is lacking straight It’s a bit hesitant to pick up the enemy’s means... and the night goddess church has a high probability of not having a “sequence”... “the church” should refer to the quiet church of the church headquarters... the low sequence of direct enemy means may not be comparable Firearms... Klein fell silent, and the balance in his mind swayed from side to side, sometimes "sneak peek at the secret person" and sometimes "the diviner". As for the "collector", he has not considered it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn Smith saw it and smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t rush to choose, Tell me the answer on Monday morning, no matter which one you choose, or you plan to give up directly, there will be no extra opinions inside our nights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calm Let's ask your own heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he took off his hat and squatted, slowly crossing Klein and heading for the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not speak, did not immediately give an answer, silently salute, silently watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has been hoping to be an extraordinary person all the time, but when the opportunity really comes to the front, he is still full of hesitation: the lack of "sequence" The out-of-control of the "extraordinary", the credibility of the Russell's diary, the fascinating and fascinating whisper of madness, together become a swamp that hinders the advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and spit out slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A student who is better than bad is not bad, fills the college entrance exam..." Klein laughed at himself, converges on divergent thinking, whispered open, and returned home. Lying on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lay there, squinting, and quietly watching the bottom of the bunk bed stained with faint blush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window is drunk and passing by, there is a carriage in the distance flying fast on the empty street, this kind of noise does not destroy the tranquility of the night, but it makes it more distant Deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s emotions have settled down, reminding me of all kinds of past events on earth, remembering the father who likes to exercise, speaks always, and thinks of chronic The disease, but I like the mother who is busy with myself, thinks of the buddies who grew up from a young age, from playing football to basketball and to the game of the game, remembering the confession object that has blurred the appearance... These It is like a quiet river flowing, not much shackles, not too deeply sentimental, but silently drowning the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps only lost will know how to cherish, when the blush fades, the horizon burns, the golden float, Klein has made a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got up and went to the public bathroom to wash his face and let himself change Get the spirit, then take 1 Sule's banknotes and go to Mrs. Wendy to buy 8 pounds of rye bread with 9 pence, supplementing the staple food that was eaten last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The price of bread began to stabilize..." After breakfast, Benson made a comment while changing clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is Sunday, he and Melissa finally got a chance to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been sitting in a chair and looking at the expired newspaper brought back yesterday, quite surprised:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are advertisements for rental of houses: No. 3, Wendell Street, North District, single-family house, two floors, six rooms upstairs, three bathrooms, two large balconies, Downstairs a dining room, a living room, a kitchen, two washrooms, two rooms, and an underground storage room... Outside the house, there are 2 acres of private lawn in front and a small garden behind, one for rent For a year, two years or three years, rent 1 pound per week for 6 sules. If you are interested, please go to the 16th Champagne Street and find Mr. Kuuchev."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is our future goal." Benson wore a black half-high hat and smiled. "The rents in the newspapers are all high. The 'Tingen City Improvement Housing Company' has cheaper options and is no worse than them. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you go to the 'Tingen Labor Class Housing Improvement Association'?" Melissa took the worn-out hat and took a few stitches. It was still the most gray-white light dress that came out of the room, coming out of the compartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is calm and introverted, but it is difficult to hide the breath of youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bansonhaha laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who did you hear from?" Mrs. Jenny Rochelle of the Class Housing Improvement Association? Or is your good friend Selena?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa looked down, Whispered replied: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Rochelle... When she was washing up last night, she just happened to meet her. She asked Klein about the interview. I probably said it. Some, then she suggested to find the 'Tingen labor class housing improvement association'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson sees Klein is also a confused, smiling and shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is aimed at the poor, oh, accurately describing the housing associations of the lower classes. The houses they built and remodeled are basically common toilet types, offering only three options. , one bedroom, two bedroom and three bedroom, do you want to continue to live in a similar place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Tingen City Improvement Housing Company' and their The same business, but also provides the middle and lower classes with the opportunity to choose. Frankly speaking, we are now a little better than the middle and lower class, but worse than the real middle class, not the salary problem, mainly because of the lack of accumulation time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein understood, took the newspaper, put on the hat, and stood up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Then let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember 'Tingen City Improvement Housing Company' is on Daffodil Street." Banson said as he opened the door, "They Like the 'Tingen Labor Class Housing Improvement Association', called '5 percent charity', know what is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't know." Klein lifted his cane and walked on the side of Melissa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the black-haired supple girl in the vest also followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson is on the road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This association and company that improves housing is subject to The impact of Beckland’s influence was established. There are three channels for their funds. One is to raise funds from charitable funds, and the other is to obtain a high-quality loan of only 4% per annum from the government public affairs loan commissioner through declaration. The third is to accept commercial investment. By charging a certain rent, the company will give the other party a return of 5% per year, so it is called '5 percent charity'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, hey, hey, the brothers and sisters went down the stairs and walked slowly to the Narcissus Street. They planned to find the house before they went to the incumbent landlord, Mr. Frank, so that there would be no way to stay there, and they had to move away. Happening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I listen to Selena, is there a purely charitable improvement housing company?" Melissa said as if thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson laughed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Sir Deville’s donation was established The Virgin Trust Company's that he built apartments for the working class and provided specialized property management, but only charged a fairly low rent. However, the requirements were very strict."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Sounds, you don't like it too much?" Klein was keenly aware, and asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I respect Sir Deville, but I don’t think he knows what the real poor people are like. The apartment’s occupancy requirements are like the pastor’s The hope is too unrealistic. For example, the main vaccine must be vaccinated. The washing room must be cleaned in turn. The house cannot be subletted or used for business. It is not allowed to litter. Children should not be allowed to play in the corridor. Goddess, Does he want to turn everyone into a gentleman and a lady?" Benson replied in his usual tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein doubts frowning:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
