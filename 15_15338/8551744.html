			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint light shines through the narrow window of the heights, making the darkness in the Morse church a bit more visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's knee-high hat, legs leaning on the cane, quietly sitting on the chair in the first row on the left side of the aisle, looking at the altar in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no statue dedicated to it, there is only a huge dark sacred emblem, its dark black is the bottom, the enamel is dotted, surrounded by just half of the blushing moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wall behind the emblem, one hole after another, the outside sun shines in, condenses into pure, miniature highlights, they are close to the surrounding The environment of the night is connected, and the avatar is for the noble starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the goddess of the night, or the eternal sun, the lord of the storm, all orthodox gods have not left a specific image, and the worship and worship can only be His Our symbol... This seems to be another manifestation of “not looking directly at God”... Klein let his thoughts diverge, and did not eagerly guard the opportunity of the seal “3—0782” to create the “Yangyan spell” ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that this kind of thing must be cautious, must be patient, and must wait. In the first ten minutes, Leonard and Cohenri may come in to remind some attention. matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an extremely quiet atmosphere, time flies, Klein suddenly comes back, takes out a silver pocket watch with a vine pattern, slams open and looks A glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past twenty minutes... He whispered silently, placing a half-height silk hat and black silver cane next to him, and got up and walked near the altar. Concealed corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is facing the side of the altar first, but when he sees the huge dark sacred emblem and the sacred sight like the projection of the night sky, he feels guilty inexplicably And uncomfortable, so turned and went to the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Klein took off the seal "3—0782" worn on the inside of the black tuxedo and bent over to put the dark golden jewel of the simple badge. On the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the abstract "sun" symbol, Klein took out a small candle mixed with sandalwood and placed it on the seal. Just below "3 - 0782". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the dual ritual method he learned from the "eternal glory": directly symbolizes Him with objects closely related to the gods, with candles Represent yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sucking a breath, alleviating the slightest tension, Klein took out the items needed for the ceremony one by one, including a knife Two thin gold pieces, black sun flower, golden rim sun flower, white sun flower mixed extract of "sun" essential oil, broccoli powder, and rosemary powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, Klein skillfully used the ritual silver plaque to guide spiritual hooligans, and circled around the simple "altar" to create an invisible Sealed walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squats, puts the silver plaque, extends his right hand, and ignites the candle that symbolizes himself in a spiritual friction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the swaying and dim light, Klein picked up the "sun" essential oil and dropped a drop of candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a little, the illusory fog spreads with a hint of sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After burning the powder of the kumquat and rosemary, Klein took the knife and the gold piece and stood up, taking a step back, using the ancient Hermes Words of mourning: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blood of eternal yang."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not extinguished The light is the embodiment of order, the god of contract, and the guardian of business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The light of indestruction, the incarnation of order, the god of contract, the guardian of business, are all part of the name of "eternal glory". If there is no prefix of "the blood of eternal sun," the ritual must acquire the gods. The response can continue, and as such, Klein suspects that "Eternal Vigor" will recognize himself as the disrespectful who looks directly at Him. At that time, Leonard and Cohenli will only see a pile of black ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, because it is stealing the power of the gods, Klein can't advance the divination in advance. He thinks that it will make him face the god again, so he can only hang a heart and carefully read the follow-up mantra. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray to you;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for your strength;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me the power to complete the Yangyan spell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blood of the eternal sun, please Pass your power to my spell..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vanilla, a herb belonging to the sun, please pass your power to my spell ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the spell coming to an end, Klein suddenly felt that there was What is lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark golden quaint coat of arms bursts with blazing light, like the sun that descends on the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was caught in extreme heat, his hair was hot and hot and seemed to be burning soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His feet seem to be naked on the yellow sand after the midday sun, and the face and body are blown by the gale in all directions again and again. Scour and polish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, he felt that he had to do something to guide and spur the burning power, otherwise he would become a human candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost no need to think, Klein raised his hands, and in the case of hot porridge, relying on the cooperation of spirituality and gale, following the instinctive memory and Guided by the ritual, began to use the knives to draw symbolic symbols, corresponding spiritual numbers, magical signs and ancient mantras on both sides of the gold piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the church, Leonard is standing in the shadows, avoiding direct shooting in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he found the sun violent, just like the hottest days of early July. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He narrowed his eyes and looked at the sky, only to see that the blue "curtain" had no trace of clouds, no dust, and it was amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strange weather." On the other side, Cohenli also noticed the change of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard was waiting for a low smile and suddenly turned his side to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brow furrowed and looked at the church as he looked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, Rosanne is not here, otherwise she will complain that the sun has sunburned her skin." Leonard regained his gaze and said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blazing sun only dimmed for a few minutes, and everything returned to its original state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the church, Klein’s knife is falling to the final. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the completion of the magical symbol symbolizing "light", the spirituality of the front and back of the gold piece has become a whole and introverted to the innermost part of the metal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this is closer to the divinity... Klein finally got rid of the hot and hot, and soberly examined the two "yangyan spells" in the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold color of their surface has become dim, the pattern is simple and complex, the feeling of warmth and moistness is oozing out a little and infiltrating Klein's skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I have a better card," Klein exclaimed silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opening spell he set for the "Yangyan Charm" is the "light" in the ancient Hermes language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want light, there is light... He ridiculed himself, and put the "Yangyan Charm" into another pocket, not with "Sleep" The Soul and the "Dream" spells are placed together because it affects the latter and reduces the time limit for their effects to be maintained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that there is no change in its surface, the feeling of warmth and purity is still assimilated around, and Klein is completely relieved, and the finish of the ceremony is completed quickly, and the spiritual wall is lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, he had the heart to check himself and found that his shirt was almost soaked, his face was sweaty and his hair was slightly curled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, okay... Klein gratified, collected the items, returned to the original seat, tired and sat down to sleep until he was stepped Sound awakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed his eyes and subconsciously touched the "Yangyan Charm" to see if it still exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your state is not too good?" asked Leonard, who entered the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein licked the next two foreheads and got up and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it is approaching the limit "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the silver pocket watch and glanced at it and said: "Exactly, it is your turn to guard the seal '3—0782'." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, Klein took off the "variation of the sun's emblem", and handed it to Leonard. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After watching him walk out of the church, Leonard converges on the gesture of hanging Lang Lang, focusing on and carefully examining the seal "3 - 0782", his expression gradually becomes confused , revealing obvious confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turn of the guards is completed, and the three nights are on the way back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, they let the Smyr priest pay attention to the situation of the town, and once there is any suspected haunted thing, immediately take a photo to the St. Serena Church. telegram. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 7:20 pm, they finally arrived at Zouteland Street and handed in the seal "3 - 0782". <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that the captain did not find an abnormality, Klein happily left the Black Thorns Security Company and rushed home before 8:00. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the key, opened the door, and suddenly saw a strange figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a girl who is obviously less than twenty, wearing a gray-white outfit and is working hard to wipe the restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is black and brown, her eyes are small, her nose is not quite strong, and her facial features are very common. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who? Klein was a glimpse, and immediately understood that this might be a miscellaneous maid who tried to do housework. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Banson lowered the newspaper and looked at his brother and smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Companies that don't let employees get off work on time are always disgusting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the salary it gives can heal this trauma." Klein responded with a smile. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the "Justice" missed 300 pounds, he told Benson and Melissa about raising his salary to 6 pounds a week, so they don't have to Worried about family finances... Klein wanted to rely on his cane, take off his hat, and walked to the living room, pressing down the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have chosen?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used the information of the three miscellaneous maids to divination yesterday and got the conclusion that it was suitable, so he gave the decision to the brother and sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Bella, weekly salary 5 Sule, very willing and able to learn cooking, she hopes to become a female chef in the future, so her week The salary will be doubled, her father is a worker at the Tingen Iron and Steel Joint Factory, and the mother is a laundry lady.” Benson smirked and replied, “Of course, another reason for me and Melissa to make a decision is that other Both maids believe in the Lord of the Storm. Only she is a believer in the goddess. I personally do not exclude the Lord of the Storm, but Melissa does not like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Melissa's attitude is not dislike, the more accurate description is to mourn its misfortune, anger, not to argue, right, Lu Xun said! Klein recalled her sister's performance all the time, with a smile on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
