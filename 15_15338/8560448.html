			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaching rain, the faint mist, the effort to illuminate the rows of gas lamps and the carriages that drive through the streets from time to time. The most common night view of Rand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to these, Klein standing behind the window noticed some welcome changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮铃铃! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisp sound echoed, a strange machine with only two wheels flew along the edge of the road and headed for the other side of the street. Its overall frame was Black, but some places show the grayness of steel. Under the ray of gas lamps that penetrate the rain, the metal is shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man sitting on the top of the machine wearing a postal staff costume, his legs constantly stepping on, it seems very hard, the position behind him is tied A wooden box painted with green paint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Promotion is very good..." White shirt black vest temperament mature Klein looked at this scene, silently sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to Beckland in just a few hours, and encountered a number of similar strange machines on the way, which is exactly what he invested and promoted. bicycle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the newspaper, Klein learned that the Beckland Bike Company had done a lot of advertising and held a bicycle race in the Jowood area and the Beckland Bridge area. In order to attract the attention of people there, in addition to these methods, they also actively promoted to the government postal, police and other departments, the effect is said to be good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their pricing strategy has listened to Klein’s original advice, avoiding the middle and upper layers of the horse-drawn carriage, and targeting the target group to a weekly salary of 10 pounds. The above-mentioned skilled workers, students with good family conditions, and public officials who need to travel outside often, so a bicycle is 3 to 5 pounds, so that people in this class can afford to bite their teeth while at the same time making lower income. The crowd shows off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem now is that Beckland often rains, and the cyclist can't play the umbrella... The next step is the raincoat." Klein regained his gaze. Shake his head and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He currently lives in a high-end hotel in the Hillston area, 10 Sule in one night, and expensive Klein is somewhat distressed, but in order to meet People set, can only bite their teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his thoughts, the identity of Dawn Dontes should be a mysterious rich man from the goddess of the night in Desi Bay. He sold it. The original land and mines are ready to come to Beckland to seek new opportunities and have a certain degree of interest in donating the title, but they are not so rich in financial resources. They can only consider broadening their contacts and making financial investments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefit of such an identity is that it is different from all the roles that Klein played before, has a clear distinction, and can naturally reach the upper middle Some characters, especially the officers of the officer's club and the bishops of the Goddess of the Night Goddess Beckland, facilitated Klein to continue investigating the truth of the Bakerland smog incident while collecting intelligence and making notes on the theft of the Antigonus family. Detailed plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are benefits, of course, there are also disadvantages, such a mysterious rich man will certainly be noticed by the "nights" and "the punishers", encountering a certain degree background check. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Klein’s experience, a similar investigation may be done by an official extraordinary organization, or it may be transferred to the police department, without involving important events. Not too serious, it is a routine matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Klein, who is an expert in the field of camouflage, designed and prepared a second-level identity for Daun Dontes to cope with background checks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second-level identity, Dawn Dontes is a guy who went to the Southland for a certain reason and ventured, and he used a pseudonym. The place that was quite dangerous and full of opportunities accumulated more than a decade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the origin of this wealth is not so bright, he secretly returned to Desi Bay, forged a new identity, ready to start a new life in Beckland, And let the wealth gradually legalize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These clues include, but are not limited to, black-boat ticket stubs from East Bylang to Connart, long-term habits of survival in the South, and unidentified wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein believes that as long as "Don. Dontes" does not directly involve more serious extraordinary events, such preparation is sufficient to survive routine background checks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you encounter a very serious official extraordinary, you want to go all the way down, and even want to ask colleagues from the South China to help, then Donne Dontes also There is a third-level identity, that is, a fraudster who has mastered certain anti-Divination skills. He pretends to be a mysterious rich man and spends a large sum of money to invest, for the final scam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This identity is enough to cause Dawn Dontes to be arrested, but the degree of attention is not too high, which gives Klein a graceful exit and disappears Opportunity in the center of the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have grown a lot compared to the first time I went to Bakerland, and I have grown a lot..." Ryan walked slowly back to the center of the room and turned his eyes to the full-length mirror in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair in his mirror is a bit white, his eyes are deep but his vicissitudes of life have gone through too many things. Middle-aged man with a taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The identity design of "Don. Dontes" is not difficult for the current Klein, available from the Chanis Gate of the Church of St. Saul After stealing the Antignus family notes, it is enough for any external extraordinary person to be an impossible task. Even the king of angels cannot guarantee that it will be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, unlike other extraordinary people, Klein has two advantages in this matter. One is that he once worked as a "nighter". Have a good understanding of the internal process, know where to use where there is no opportunity, so the earliest way to eliminate it is to become a "nighter", mixed into the interior, looking for opportunities to pass the Chanis Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with this approach is that the "nights" cannot enter the Chanis Gate at will, even if the captain and the deacon are the same, there must be an incident to get The corresponding authority, and there are internal guards behind the door of Chanis, chaos and chaos will lead to attacks, outbreaks of battle - Klein does not want his theft caused the death of the goddess church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After careful thought, he targeted the internal caretaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These old people are retired "nights", volunteered to enter the door of Chanis, responsible for guarding the seals, they and the night are part of the two departments, in and out Passing through the passage of the church floor, it does not interfere with the work of the night-timers, nor will it be disturbed by the night-timers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps because of the long-awaited relationship behind the Chanis Gate, these internal caretakers have a certain specificity, a cold atmosphere, lack of expression, pale skin, like Deep in the dark between the state of life and death, Klein believes that as long as he meets, it is not difficult to determine the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His initial plan was to rent a housekeeper, maid, maid, gardener, cook and carriage in the North District near St. Seychelles Church. The husband, propped up the shelf of the rich man, and often went to the church to pray earnestly, participate in the mass, donate money, and get familiar with the bishops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, he will try to find people who are suspected of internal caretakers, choose two or three goals, observe their living conditions, at the right time One of them is imprisoned, changed to his appearance, or directly attached to him, through the Chanis Gate, waiting to see or take the Antignus family notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very rough plan, closer to the idea, and it depends on Klein's continuous improvement based on the various information collected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this matter, Klein’s second advantage is that he has the Tarot Club, the Goddess Church and the helper that the "Night" can’t think of, and He could also consider developing a "nighter" or caretaker in the Beckland parish to enter the party and complete the theft through traitors, just like the Charatna that used Russell's family to take the Antignus family notes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's still necessary to go to church often. Only then can you find the target..." Klein faced the mirror and nodded his head silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that his heart is very contradictory at this time, if there is a "nighter" or caretaker willing to sell the church, to serve the "fool" His first thought would be to drop the punishment and get rid of this disgusting traitor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
