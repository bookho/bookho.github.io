			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, a basement like a temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. wearing a black robes with a hood, quietly squatting in front of the giant statue of the hanging man, for a long time no action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he leaned his side and seemed to be listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief pause, Mr. A jerked his hands and smashed his right index finger with his left palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stuffed the bloody finger into the mouth and chewed it like a snack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mr. A’s throat squirmed and swallowed the bitten fingers into the abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body trembled as if it was being shaken by invisible people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this state, Mr. A stretched his right hand and wrote a word on the ground with the blood flowing down the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words are not the giant language that speaks the power of nature, the dragon language, nor the Hermes language used for sacrifices, but the most common and ordinary Enwen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright red color quickly condenses, and the words are pieced together into several paragraphs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Found:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fool who does not belong to this era;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mysterious ruler above the fog ;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king of yellow and black who is in good luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Deaf and the Believers, in Beckland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With "God" At the end of the content, Mr. A stopped shaking and a new finger appeared on the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He buried his head and carefully looked at the words he had just written down, his mouth curling up a little in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only obey your god!" Mr. A humbled to the ground and seemed to find the meaning of existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of Silver, the upper part of the round tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Weiya walked to the window and looked down at the little candlelight in the darkness, and the look gradually softened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, she heard a loud knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Chief’?” Loyya turned lightly and asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is windless and automatically open backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a "hunter" Colin Iliat standing outside, he is wearing a brown coat with a leather-covered belt around his waist. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luo Weiya, the anomaly of the exploration team has been confirmed." Colin said in a straightforward manner, "As captain, whether you have problems or not, All must go to the dungeon for seven days, accept the baptism of the 'Glory Crown', you should be very clear, this is the rule."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luoweiya did not have the slightest anger, calm laughter道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, I am ready to stay in the dungeon for a long time, and until the end, if you are not at ease, I can accept any arrangement." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, she has walked to the door and crossed the "hunter" Colin face to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin turned silently, followed her obliquely, stepping down the spiraling step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halfway through, the two heard the crying and shouting of heartbreaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you starting again?" Luo Weiya asked a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin nodded and said dumbly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, this is the fate we can't escape..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the middle of the round tower, in a hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploring the squad members and their extra-pollution residents of the Silver City are being pressed in place by the sacred brilliance of the essence, unable to move, as if carrying a giant mountain . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of forties, the black-skinned couple each took a straight sword with a complicated pattern and walked to a young man in his early twenties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s body has collapsed, like a muddy mud, but his head is intact, but he has grown a bloody thin whisker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the couple coming over, he shouted in horror:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, Mom, you guys What to do?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you say that you want to eat grilled shovel tonight? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, Mom, I have caught a lot of irons for you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That The couple couldn’t bear to look sideways, but the straight sword in their hands was raised.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two sounds, the young man stopped crying Shouting, first convulsions, and then completely lost signs of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, a girl in her teens raised a straight sword with a complicated pattern and screamed at her sister with tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman lying on the floor suddenly smiled and said softly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today In the future, you have to live your own life, don't be naive again...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl suddenly cried and the line of sight was blurred, and the straight sword in his hand stopped in the air.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a strong palm pressed against the back of her hand and jerked forward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;噗!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is lying there, it seems that nothing can be heard, nothing can be seen.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the ancient curse that hangs over everyone in Silver City. You must kill your blood relatives yourself to prevent him from becoming a terrible and weird evil after death.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even if Dak has completely changed into a monster, and is polluted by unknowns, and does not have the value of interrogation, the "shadow" monitor did not dare to kill him on the spot, but instead worked hard Control, bring Round tower, waiting for his parents, otherwise things will be more troublesome.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same polluted expedition team members are accepting for two thousand years The treatment, although no one knows whether they will change after death in this state, but no one dares to gamble.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, The population of Baiyincheng is not too much, and it is trapped in one place. Under the arrangement of the higher generations, there are not a few blood relationships between them. Even if it must be limited to three generations, it can be better.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, when arranging the patrol squad list, the responsible person must first consider the blood factor to prevent accidents.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp For the exploration team, the requirements are not so strict, because their tasks are often deep and dark, far from the Silver City, even if they die, even if they change, it will not affect everyone's safety.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a resident no longer has a blood relative within three generations, he will be strictly Monitoring, as long as he appeared seriously ill or aging obviously, will immediately be sent to the depths of darkness, away from the silver city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former exploration team leader who was previously isolated in the dungeon was in the delta, there were actually three elders in the round tower, but the final shot was only "Chief "Colin Iliad, otherwise you can only try to seal." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that Yud is his brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shepherd" Lovja and "Hunter" Colin silently entered the bottom of the round tower, accompanied by several Dawn Knights Going to the depths of the dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the two stopped outside a cell, and the knights of the dawn were scattered in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovija did not have an abnormality, and quickly entered the room with only one bed, one table, and one candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the metal door closed, she turned her body and looked at the "hunter" Colin with a light gray eye, calmly saying:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Chief', you once told me that the residents of Silver City are far from here, and when they die in the depths of the dark, they will not immediately become evil spirits, have to wait for several Days, so the rest of the team explored the team and had plenty of time to open the distance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin nodded, indicating that it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Weiya closed her eyes and showed a little sad smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two In a search a month ago, a member of the team died in front of me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pretended to be separated from other players, and waited for five days there, but he Nothing turns into evil spirits. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Demon Hunter" Colin looked at her silently and said nothing until the metal door slammed and the seal formed.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, in the ancient palace.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein waited for a while, seeing the deep red star that symbolizes the little "sun" has nothing to change, and finally relieved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be Successful... He licked his forehead, wrapped himself in spirit and fell back to the real world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just feeling the presence of the body, Klein tasted it. The cold taste.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sneezed and quickly lifted the spiritual wall and re-drilled into the bed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly, his bed is already cold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, after entering the fog, my body is protected to a certain extent, otherwise tomorrow I’m afraid I have a cold... Klein is wrapped up I sighed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This state now reminds him of a whisper that I have heard in my life:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Basic heating is basically shaking...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the bed is warmed up again, he can only divulge his thoughts and think about various problems.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, I don’t seem to have any urgent matters recently. The "Magician Code" is completed, even if it is no longer impossible to challenge, just do the normal "performance", the New Year I can also digest the potions step by step before and after. My next major arrangement is to collect the extraordinary materials of the "no face" potion, and accumulate the corresponding money, but this rush is also anxious... Klein’s mind is tight The strings gradually softened, and suddenly there was the idea of ​​resting for two or three days.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the warmth of the bed, he fell asleep unconsciously, and when he woke up, he just heard the church. The bell banged eight times.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stretched out his arm and felt it Face cold, and quietly shrink back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have cooled down again...nothing to do, there seems to be a night of sleep... His mind reopened his eyes relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bed for a while, he heard the snoring of his stomach and felt the swelling of his lower abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is really a tough choice everywhere... Klein muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying to fight against those two feelings after ten minutes, he finally gave up, slammed into the bed and rushed to the bathroom next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change the clothes, wash it, he went down to the first floor, turned out the ingredients, ready to do the Fenett surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he didn’t plan to use the bolognese that he bought, he wanted to try the meatballs that he had done two days ago, which is based on his taste. Carefully select the ingredients to make the meat chop, although some of the ingredients in the two worlds are always a little different, the taste is difficult to really restore, but after Klein tasted, it feels good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
