			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diary that has been carefully selected by the "Mysterious Queen" must have a very important content. "Footer" Klein brings the spirit together and looks like a careless look. The yellow-brown parchment that was thrown into the hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On September 11th, since becoming an angel, I have a feeling of splitting my personality. In my heart, in my spirit, deep in my spirit, there is always a voice that urges me, affects me, creates uncontrollable indifference, bloodthirsty, cruelty and madness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This does not come from the outside world, nor is it the influence of the gods on its own path. I can clearly feel that it is derived from genes. The collective subconsciousness derived from human generations has originated from the extraordinary characteristics itself. Not the spiritual influence left above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It gives me a strong desire to hunt and kill, wanting to devour all the creatures with extraordinary characteristics around me, which makes me have to spend most of my energy to fight It, even if I am already playing, I have not seen any improvement in the digestive potion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder 'Men' said that reason is temporary, madness is eternal of. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On September 28th, I haven’t written a diary for a long time. For the past half month, I seem to be watching myself being replaced by strangers a little bit. A little bit cold and terrible, even my daughter Bernard can only make me have a small amount of fatherly love, rarely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when I was going crazy, I seemed to hear countless praises, that is my subjects, that is all that benefits in my reforms. People, that are the believers who regard me as the 'son of steam', praise me, praise me, erect statues for me, write stories for me, and create poetry for me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their sounds like the anchor of the ship, helping me 'position' myself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I began to have the ability to fight against that kind of screaming against the heartfelt cry. I walked out a little and could have the normal emotions of being a father, a husband, and a man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just a sequence 2, there is such a change, to the sequence 0, to the level of true God, how terrible is the madness to fight?<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe they also need to 'position' to counter the strong out-of-control tendency hidden in the depths of extraordinary traits and collective subconsciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I probably understand why they want to establish a church, why spread faith, why write a chapter for the saints of their own power, and leave the corresponding angels Legends...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But why do they have no human image, just a symbolic symbol? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next time I ask 'Mr.', he is There is a lot of knowledge in the realm of the gods. If he was not exiled at the beginning, there might be one more god. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"September 29, reviewing the diary of yesterday, I remembered the rituals of my sequence 4, sequence 3, and sequence 2, respectively. They are obviously crazy and cruel, just like the villains in the novel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sequence approach is probably the path that is destined to be desperately desperate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this again It is the only way for mankind to gain extraordinary power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s funny, ironic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We work hard to save ourselves, just to be more How to destroy yourself more thoroughly? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the diary on the first page shows that Klein is heavy and depressed. Russell who wrote those sentences is no longer an ordinary person, has become an angel, Joined the "Twilight Hermitage" and read the "Slate". He knows the extraordinary characteristics of the mysterious world far better than the present, but he is more pessimistic than him. He seems to think that the world is essentially distorted from the source. Crazy, destined to self-destructive.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Seven Gods seem to find a way to stay sensible, ordinary humans are not without a role, they recognize their When spirituality comes together, it is possible to help the gods “position” the original image and retain the memories and rationality accumulated in the past years... This can be inferred from Russell’s personal experience... But why did the Seven Gods abandon the original human beings? Image, use the symbolic abstraction of the emblem? This is not in line with my judgment... I can't understand... Klein didn't waste time, turned to the next page diary:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is still the same as before, always asking for me to help him return to the real world, but not too persistent, and will answer some questions randomly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, He is like playing games, trying to improve the sensitivity, but, sorry, I have locked this option ahead of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I already know the legends of the kings of angels, I asked Mr. 'Men' with a mentality of asking what to ask and not losing anything, the point is At what level is the strength of the kings of angels.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. 'Men' said that some of the kings of angels accommodated uniqueness, and some took two copies. Sequence 1 potion, some of which are available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word 'accommodation' is used very strangely. I have questions about this. Mr. Gate did not answer directly, just told me if there is no way. Accommodating 'uniqueness, that is in the ceremony, before the promotion sequence 0, the uniqueness is dragged down rather than assisted by the angel of sequence 1.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Understandably, as with the '0' seal, the negative effects are always terrible, and the uniqueness is definitely more exaggerated than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked which of the kings of angels to accommodate the uniqueness, and Mr. Gate did not answer directly, just that Amon and Adam let all angels From the heart of the heart, because they are born with uniqueness, do not have to consider the problem of 'accommodation'. From another perspective, Amon and Adam itself is equivalent to taking the uniqueness of the sequence 1 potion? It is the son of the Creator!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The creator, also known as the ancient sun god, is so powerful that it can be passed on to each of his two children. Uniqueness, and the extraordinary characteristics of Sequence 1... Is He purifying himself and eliminating unnecessary interference? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, does the 'Men' also have 'accommodated' uniqueness, and even took two copies of the sequence 1 potion? I did not ask because I I know that He will definitely not answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the process of communication, Mr. Gate" reminded me not to directly mention the full name of Adam, otherwise I will be aware that Was found in the conversation just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I probably understand what it is, smile and ask him, have you already said the full name of Adam?<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The answer to Mr. 'Men' is okay, because the sequence 4 of the 'apprentice' route is called 'Secret Master', which has a certain conservative secret meaning, although not as good as the 'secret servant' of the 'night' approach. But it is also enough for the existence of his level to shield the induction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked a lot of questions about the gods, 'Mr.' did not answer, just said, after I have the ability to have the opportunity, go to the moon If you look at it, you can understand a lot of things.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is consistent with some of my previous ideas, but I suspect that he is tempting me to Return to the real world, after all, every time he appears, it is related to the moon! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as Mr. "Gate" appears, the amount of information is very large, and will always fill a page... Well, his strength to "King of Angels" The level of interpretation is in line with my speculation...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad meaning of "king of angels" means relying on various methods, beyond the sequence 1, but not reaching the sequence 0 of the quasi-god, this includes the "uniqueness" and taking the extra sequence 1 potion, the narrow "king of angels" refers specifically to the creator of the silver city believes - the ancient sun gods lead all the angels eight The kings, of course, they are certainly in line with the broad standard... Klein has quickly flashed many thoughts in his mind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Russell to the ancient sun god Guess, he strongly agrees that the creator of Baiyincheng’s “recycling” of the ancient gods is too many and too complicated, and there are signs of chaos and madness, so he has decisively gave birth to two children, thereby excluding some of them. "Miscellaneous".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, both Amon and Adam are drinking Sent... It seems that the "Utopian Angel" Adam clearly possesses the uniqueness of the "audience" approach. He should be the mysterious leader of the "Twilight Hermit Society". From ancient times to the present, he intervened to resurrect his father. The change of the times... I don't know if he has promoted the sequence 0... Even if there isn't, the number of angels that can be dispatched by the "Twilight Hermit" will be beyond my imagination... Well, "Secret Master" has the meaning of keeping secrets. There is a hidden meaning... Klein thought of the symbol behind the chair of "The Fool":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
