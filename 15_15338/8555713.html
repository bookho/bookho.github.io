			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "desire apostle" who once wore Patrick Jason's skin immediately stopped and looked around in horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, he has vaguely noticed the advent of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is located on the edge of a garden, where the grass is dying due to the cold winter, revealing dark brown soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the street on the right side, there were not many pedestrians on the working day afternoon. At this time, there were no passing signs and no abnormalities were found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The desire apostle" suddenly reflected a silver, a full body armor came from the other side of the garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It slanted down on the left shoulder, dyed a piece of coagulated blood, revealing the beauty of the demon, itself seems very heavy, each step makes the ground appear slightly Shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just seeing this bloody silver armor, "Desire Apostle" has a feeling of poor breathing, as if encountering the most terrible natural enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How come it is so fast? They saw my trick so soon? "Desire Apostle" restores calm, restores cold blood, and infuse the emotions and desires of the extraordinary person in the blood-stained armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what made him desperate was that the silver armor completely blocked his extraordinary ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just touched a stone and touched the cold armor without the wearer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Desire Apostle had to raise his right hand and open a huge bat wing, with a few blue flames condensing quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, his right hand tiger’s mouth flashed silver, his thumb fell to the ground, and the incisions were neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brush, brush, brush, silver flashing, "Desire Apostle" The remaining nine fingers are broken at the same time, and the suitcase he carries is also screaming. On the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desire of the "Apostles" is shrinking like a needle tip, immediately agitating the pair of huge bat wings behind them and fleeing in the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of his soles has shrunk unconsciously and is hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Desire Apostle just ran two steps, and countless silver mans burst out of his body like a fireworks in full bloom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Covering the viscous black liquid raindrops on his body surface, his fractures of the arms, arms, shoulders, ribs, neck and other parts are smoothly spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, "Desire Apostle" pale blood-stained large intestine, as well as a wriggling stomach bag and a contraction of the heart that has not stopped, all spilled Ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where he is based, the bright red blood is the thickest, and the more it goes around, the more sputter-like, which together constitute a beautiful flower of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong one of the sequence 5, a "desire apostle" who just completed the impossible assassination, was thus split without any resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "1" seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the seal "1-42" that once killed more than 100,000 people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Mitchell, wearing the terrible armor, struggled forward in the first two steps, looking at the corpses of the ground and raising the volume:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has not died completely!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and added: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Different demons have different characteristics. This 'desire apostle' is a shadow. He just abandoned his body and left only the shadow."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Soulist" Soest told some of the night and "Mechanical Heart" members "to prevent ordinary people from approaching" while looking at the scene and listening to Leonard's Discourse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out his pocket watch, glanced at it, and asked with a dignified expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s only ten minutes, is it enough? Don’t force it!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem! '1-42' has locked him, I feel its excitement. Leonard said without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soest opened the five fingers of Zhang Daihong gloves, and said to the other nights:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You bring hot water, follow Leonard, and if there is a problem, immediately replace it and dig the 'bathtub' on the spot!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, leave a mark, I and other players will catch up very quickly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬,蹬,蹬, blood-stained silver armor began to run and catch up, seemingly heavy, but incredibly fast.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorce watched these red gloves leave and turned to Icons:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Berard Deacon, you led The remaining members of 'Mechanical Heart' went to the house, guarding the Duke's Guard and other people living on the scene. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guard? "Icons subconsciously asked a question.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soest's focus:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' The Desire Apostle's how can it be determined that the Duke would go to the house today, even to a time node, so that the "Singer of God" was introduced very well in advance? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icone instantly stunned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean a member of the Duke Guard or the Duke A person you trust is an associate of the Desire Apostle? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, the time difference cannot be grasped so well!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called action does not exist successfully The possibility!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It can only be said that this reason has the greatest probability, and it is not excluded that there is a master of prophecy behind the 'desire apostle'. Soest no longer said more, led the second batch of nights, followed the imprint, reinforcements of the teammates in front.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons calmed his face and led the rest The "Mechanical Heart" returned to the residence of the Duke of Nigan's mistress.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at the pale sun behind the mist, knowing the whole Beckland, and even Throughout the Kingdom of Lun, the situation in the whole world will change with today's events.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;In the dark sewer, a shadow is sticking to the bottom of the stone wall and flies in a certain direction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to use the blood-stained armor to be tall and heavy Inconvenient to move in some narrow areas of the sewer, open the other side!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this shadow will stop and go through every distance .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dark surface continues to bulge and consolidate, seemingly to grow new flesh and blood, but because of the lack of materials, there is no Can succeed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Desire Apostle" gives a painful respite, feeling that in this state, he may break into the uncontrolled hell at any time.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He eased for a while, refused to reduce the hazards of the problem, and continued to run away, fearing that the terrible blood-stained silver armor had quietly chased behind him.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Craig Club, Klein enters the lounge and walks to the toilet with a newspaper.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fears that the "desire apostle" flees in advance, leaving a hidden danger for himself, for innocent private detectives such as Essinger Stanton and Caslana, so he is ready to go to the fog Make a second divination, confirm the current situation of the other party, and adopt a targeted strategy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat the previous process, use paper people instead of their own Klein sitting To the position of the Fool, there is a handkerchief of Jason Beria, the current position of the divination.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the gray dream world, Klein saw a light sewer, saw a living shadow, and saw that the other side seemed to fill the body of flesh and blood but always failed, and saw that he had faded some tiny black dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture went up and came to the ground area, revealing a towering church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Spirit Cathedral... Klein opened his eyes and held the "desire of apostles":<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is really not caught, but it seems to have been seriously injured, the state is very wrong, and it is a bit strange! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His suitcase is gone... It should have been discarded when it was injured... Klein thought a little, thinking about the use of divination, recalling Baekeland De map and let it come to the present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, he also produced a rough layout of the Beckland sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——He has used the sewers to collect similar information, focusing on the Eastern District, the Beckland Bridge area and the Jowood area where he is located. He has already completed the first stage of the goal, figured out the main layout of the sewer network, and then wants to refine it, it needs a very long insistence. Sometimes, Klein even wants to sneak into the Beckland City Hall, directly Peek over the corresponding design. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the two maps and the pictures seen in the previous "Dream Divination", Klein found that "Desire Apostles" Beria did not flee in the direction of the Tsock River. Going straight to the Hillston area, I seem to want to go through it and enter the artificial lake in Queens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, he is getting closer and closer to me..." Klein felt a move and suddenly had an idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I am not sure which way he will pass, but I can judge it by means of divination... He was seriously injured and the state is very strange. The interference has become extremely weak. In the case of not far away, it is not impossible to find it. After all, I have seen him in a real way, and I have a certain sense of breath... Looking for people, I am professional... I must do something. What, can't let him run like this! Time is up! After confirming the level of danger, Klein made up his mind and returned to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the candles, quickly arranged the ceremony, summoned himself, and responded to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, there was a black full-length armor, a black crown, and a cloak of the same color in the washroom. It was spiritual and carried "black." The emperor's brand of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also "inclusive" the "sun brooch" and "biotoxin bottle" and other magical items, in order to be foolproof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he hid in the air and left the Cragg club from the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein can fly at this time, so the speed is very fast, but it will not sway, because he is a spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He "scraped" a tree and took away a dead branch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the true look of Jason Beria, who had seen it, the little breath he remembered and the handkerchief as a medium, Klein used the ", combined with the layout map, quickly determined the sewer that the other side passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drilling into the dark and stinking place, Klein passes through a large number of narrow areas at the fastest speed and enters a more spacious area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark river linger, the mixed taste permeates the surroundings, he adjusts the direction from time to time, chasing Jason Beria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Desire Apostle" almost lost control, busy pause, close Wet walls and cold pipes try to close the bloodthirsty and killing desires in our hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, call, that thin shadow has ups and downs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he suddenly turned his head and looked at the place he had just passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark body armor and the black crown first reflected his "eyes", sketching a majestic figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the figure, there is no heavy cloak that gently sways with his advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s nearby!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
