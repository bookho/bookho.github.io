			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein unscrewed the lid of the metal vial and scraped it to the nose, smelling a slightly irritating but refreshing taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a "sunny powder" made from herbs such as deep sleep flowers, dragon's blood grass, crimson sandalwood and mint, because it is simple to make, Klein After replenishing the materials in the underground trading market, I was looking for a chance to get a bottle, which is now in use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He poured out some "Sunday Powder" into his palm, and then precipitated the spirit and made his eyes deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Klein took the metal vial, picked up the powder, poured the spirit into it, and sprinkled it on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sprinkled and walked around the body of Sirius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible walls are erected and isolated from the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shakes off the remaining "Sunny Powder" and takes out other metal vials, and drops the liquid such as "Amanda" pure dew inside. To the surrounding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order in which he arranged the ritual was different from that of the old Neil at the Riel Bieber family, because the things that he wanted to pray for were different, and the desired purpose It is also different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the old Neil sprinkles the liquid first, then uses the "Sunny Powder", which creates a serenity and holiness next to the official altar, and Ryan first used "Sunny Powder" and then sprinkled liquid, because his purpose was to avoid the spirituality of Sirius's remnants being disturbed by the surrounding things and to have an environment that barely met the ritual needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If he switched to the way of Neil, the spirituality of Sirius’s remnants would be expelled and could not be communicated at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, Klein collected the materials, kept the state of meditation, and whispered the lyrics written in Hermes:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for the power of the night;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for hidden power;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for the goddess' care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray that you will let me communicate spiritually with the cultists in the altar. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the resurgence of the mantra in a sealed environment, Klein suddenly felt To the majestic, horrible, secret power of the coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His nephew is completely black, it seems to have lost his pupil and lost his white eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catch this opportunity, Klein silently recites the "Divination Statement":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Clown The formula of the potion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The formula of the clown potion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In meditation, he used meditation to make himself enter the dream for a short time and stood in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the sky and the earth's gray world, Klein was clearly watching this transparent, illusory figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out his right hand and touched the spirit that remained to Sirius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang, the scene in front of him changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a dark red painted desk with a silver candlestick carrying three candles, with a blank piece of stationery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siris is holding a pen and writing a generic Lun language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is The second recipe, the name of the note is 'Clown'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main and extraordinary material is: an adult Hornachs grey goat with a single crystal, a complete face rose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siris It seems that I don't need to think about it. I brushed the formula of the clown potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he paused a little, took a sip of coffee, and then untied the silver pendant wrapped around his wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds the pendant, half closes his eyes, muttering to himself "Destruction Day", "The Peace of Mind", "May the Lord Bless", "Repent for You" Wait for words and sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Siris had finished praying, Klein finally saw the look of the pendant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the silver bracelet clasped by a ring, a thumb-sized human figure is placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statue has a unique vertical single eye of the giant, with the head facing down, the feet tied by chains and connected to the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the giant’s vertical single eye suddenly flashed a blood red shimmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene that Klein saw was instantly fragmented, his legs were soft and almost fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a pain in his head, and Klein was blood red in his eyes, and his hands were involuntarily supported on his knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few seconds, he slowed down and stood up again, only to feel that his spirituality was extremely weak, and he seemed to hear a whisper of piercing spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, thanks to his progress in "digesting" the potion, the abnormal response quickly returned to calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hanging giant, the real creator... Sirius and Henas are members of the Aurora? But the captain in Henas. What I saw was a huge cross, a horrible existence that was hung on the cross, not the 'hanging giant' of the Aurora..." Klein took two deep breaths, waiting for the slow recovery of spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora will be a hidden organization that has only appeared in the last two or three hundred years. They worship the "real creator" and use the hanging giant as the symbol of existence. I believe that everyone has divinity. As long as the spirit is strong enough to withstand the test again and again, it can accumulate rich deity and become an angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the internal data of the night people, the sequence 9 that Aurora will master is called the “secret person”. These extraordinary people can detect the existence of some mysterious horror. With a certain amount of ritual knowledge and a small amount of ritual magic, there is enough evidence to show that the senior "secret person" will be more or less distorted in cognitive views and easily out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequence that Aurora will master is unknown. Sequence 8 is the "listener", which is quite a terrible extraordinary "professional":<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every "listener" can directly hear the corresponding secret whispers, so they often get a lot of powerful, distorted, unique abilities, but correspondingly," If the listeners are unable to get promoted, they will not survive for more than five years. In addition, the internal information given by the night is given that all the "listeners" are mad, even if they usually perform normally, they must be hidden. madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein flew through the information of the Aurora in his mind, initially judging that Sirius was a "secret person." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the description, the secret person and the diviner are as bad as the encounter, which is in line with the performance of Sirius, and later the serious injury caused the loss of control? Forehead, Frye said that after the death of each extraordinary person, there will be some strange changes in more or less..." Klein thought as he circled his chest and praised the goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the spirituality recovered a little, and he ended the ceremony in order, unlocking the sealed spiritual wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blew, and Klein forced himself to look at the body of Sirius again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed that there was a clear sarcoma on the bloody face of Sirius, a dark purple near-black sarcoma, which seemed to have liquid and light shaking. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bent over and picked up his cane, letting the other part bear the weight of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the anti-phagic changes, he knew that the spirituality of Sirius remained completely destroyed. Even the "Psychic" Dai Li could not communicate with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a while, Klein waited for Captain Dunn and teammates Leonard and Cohen Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that you and the extraordinary, and the evil forces have a fateful embarrassment, the extraordinary events you encountered during this time, than we have seen in the previous quarter More." Leonard looked at the corpse on the ground and made a joke like a mouthful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may not be a coincidence." Klein Horan thought of the red chimney seen in "Dream Divination" and the last peak of the Hornaces Mountains. The palace and the invisible gaze, then took the opportunity and ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun looked around in a circle and looked at Klein Road with a faint ashes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Have you tried psychic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene of "Sunny Powder" and pure dew essential oil has a residue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Klein calmly replied, "I am worried that you will come too late, and the residual spirituality will show signs of dissipating."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at your situation, isn't it too good?" The short Cohenri cares about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, while handing the letter that Sirius has not sent to the captain, said from the beginning:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "When I went to the underground trading market to buy ritual materials, I suddenly thought that Selena had been to the Dragon Bar, and that Henas Vansente introduced her, which indicates that Henas is a frequent visitor there. Therefore, I suspect that the gentleman on the portrait, the gentleman who has a certain relationship with Hainas, may have been to the underground trading market."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hold The portrait asked the owner, Swein, who gave a positive answer and told me that the gentleman tried to buy the cultural relics and ancient books related to the main peak of Honachs. This reminds me of this, and I think that when I borrowed the corresponding journals, someone Just returned..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard smiled and suddenly interrupted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you With the certificate of the inspector and the badge of the Special Operations Department, come here to investigate the borrowing records of those journals? In fact, I am very curious, why do you have a conflict with this gentleman? Even if you encounter it directly, you should pretend not to know what you are doing, leave the library as soon as possible, and go to Zouteland Street to find us for help."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you don't have to take risks, as long as you have set goals, as long as he hasn't left Tingen, there will always be methods to find them." Dunn, who is following the letter, follows Added one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was a little embarrassed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The administrator of the library recognized him, loudly Call the police officer to help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't pretend I didn't hear..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenner De and Cohen Li immediately looked at each other, one did not hide the smile, one turned his head to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den gently decapitated and let his eyes move away from the letter:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Psychic What's the harvest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw a pendant carved with a hanging giant, saw the giant's one-eyed flash of blood red, and then quit the ceremony." Ryan said truthfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say "clown" potion for the time being, which is based on two considerations:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the one hand, if Dunn and others can find the corresponding records from the hiding place of Sirius in the follow-up investigation, then he said that there is no difference between saying and saying that there is no additional credit. On the other hand, if Dunn and others did not find it, he could find an opportunity to report in the future, and more credit for the application of materials and the distribution of potions. This is a way of dividing the credit into two collars, which comes from the words and deeds of the old Neil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
