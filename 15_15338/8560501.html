			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then wait a moment, do you want coffee, or black tea?" Bellin asked enthusiastically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I was young, I like coffee, I like that kind of Aroma, but now, I am more able to accept black tea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also like black tea, then...a cup of marquis black tea?" Bellin smiled and proposed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Metropolitan Helping Family Servant Association's coffee and black tea are of average quality and belong to the lower-middle grade. Marquis black tea is brought from home. For your own enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not a person who has no knowledge, and is very good at observing. Just after getting started, I will take all the details of the surrounding environment into my eyes without revealing the traces. The coffee and black tea pots placed in the cabinet are very common. I believe that the quality of the things inside will not be too high. Therefore, he believes that the Marquis black tea is either a collection of associations, used to entertain guests, or is privately owned by a woman in front, but no matter how It is enough to explain each other's wishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not debunk, smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, my proposal I can't refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what to call you, madam? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Belin, call me Bellin." "Belin smiles like a flower.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately walks into the room and lets the colleague who is really responsible for the data pick the right person, then back At the reception desk, pick up the tin-plated tin can and skillfully soak up the black tea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哎, have a good-looking face, have a good temperament, have an identity Wearing, even if you are middle-aged, you can feel the goodwill of a beautiful girl... Klein experienced similar things for the first time and couldn’t help it for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes He is more and more aware of the importance of “only himself” in the no-face-to-face code.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t keep this in mind, addicted to appearance The advantage will always be the same, forgetting or even rejecting the past, gradually getting lost!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Bellin carries a white glazed porcelain with gold The cup of tea came over and was placed in front of Mr. Dawn. Mr. Dontes, smiling: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It still needs cold For a while. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked down at the cup and said half-jokingly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This just makes I adjusted my mood to treat this black tea more formally. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His implied compliments and gratitudes make Belin's mood better, only that Mr. Dontes is a true gentleman, and he can speak very much." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is certainly not the believer of the Lord of the Storm... Belin has gathered the long hair of the brown micro-volume, actively returns to the inside, urging colleagues.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, she took a stack of information and sat down on the single sofa next to her:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "After screening, there are three suitable butlers. Let me give you an overview. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, Mr. Asnia, 55 years old, he served the Viscount of Yorkville, and later the family finance crisis due to the failure of the Viscount investment deposit exploration He had to sell the land manor and deport a large number of servants and left. In the past ten years, he has been hired by two rich people to make an outstanding contribution to the management of their family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, Bellin Brown is light, just like hiding two stars, with the unique vitality of young girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gently slammed the first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did he leave the two rich people?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The first rich man made a lot of investment in Dongbailang. The whole family moved over. Mr. Asnia did not want to leave Beckland, so he offered to resign. The second rich man is not very good because of his good health. The family affairs were handed over to his children, and the gentleman had a more trusting steward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Asnia is a believer in the night god, politics The tendency is more conservative, and the annual salary required is 130 pounds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the goddess protect him." Klein clicked clockwise four times on the chest and drew a red moon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellin 眸光一亮:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Tang Taisi, you are also a believer in the goddess? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course. Klein smiled and nodded. There was no explanation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder so gentle! Belin sighs and continues to introduce:<br /><br />&nbsp Mr. Ribak, 48, once served in the Nigan family, served as a deputy butler for a long time, a housekeeper assistant, and later became a steward of Baron Sindras in a deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Duke of Nigan was not assassinated for a long time. Mr. Ribak, whose service life had expired, failed to get a new contract from Mr. Baron and had to go to our association for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is a shallow believer in the Lord of the Storm, his character has no problems, and his political inclination is also the Conservative Party. The salary required is 120 pounds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened quietly, nodding his head from time to time, without interrupting Belin’s remarks.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Beining flipped the paper and looked at it again, saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third place, Mr. Walter, 42 years old, at the home of the Conrad Through the manor deacon and the housekeeper assistant, because of some things, and the steward has a contradiction, and actively chose to leave, he requested an annual salary of 115 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is a believer in the goddess of the night, and the political tendency is the new party."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olawi The new governor is a member of the Conrad family. Their family is a loyal supporter of the royal family... Klein’s mind flashed through the corresponding information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the introduction, Belin will pass the stack of information:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Tang Taisi, Which one do you want to choose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pondered for a few seconds, with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" So let them three at 9 am tomorrow morning to where I live, I will meet with them, talk about it, and finally make a decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knows that similar associations don't provide accommodation, just a pure intermediary. Even if you decide who you want now, you have to wait until the afternoon or tomorrow to see your stewards. So it's better to get a small interview and choose a one that suits your intentions. Bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Bellin smiled. "Your address is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein drank the lipstick tea, picked up the paper and pen on the table, and wrote down the location and name of the current hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, just come to Beckland?" Bellin glanced and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, she discovered that Mr. Dawn. Mr. Downes had a darker skin than normal, slightly bronzed, like a long-lasting exposure, A little rough taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, his accent is not Beckland... Belin slowly recalls more details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I came from Desi Bay and waited for an excellent The butler helped me find the right house and servant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
