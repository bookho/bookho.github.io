			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, more than a month ago." Allen pushed the gold-rimmed glasses on the bridge of the nose and gave a positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a month ago? Isn't it time that you are troubled by the nightmare of Will Anthony? Klein was surprised and confused, but did not let emotions appear on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, he associates himself with two divinations:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will. Saitin is in a dark room with a flowing sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that a sign of amniotic fluid or blood? Klein’s heart glimpsed, and suddenly he was ashamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at Dr. Allen, his eyes are quite complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suspects that the other wife is pregnant with Will Anthony, a Mercury Snake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the symbol of occultism, the Mercury Snakes end to end, devour their own tails, with the meaning of a fateful cycle... Will. In order to avoid the enemy, Ting took the initiative to open a new cycle in advance? Klein made guesses based on the knowledge he currently has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Allen was completely unaware of the anomaly he had tried to cover up, and smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He It must be a lovely guy. When he is born, I will hold a banquet to celebrate his arrival, Sherlock, and don't refuse my invitation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Maybe she." Klein responded with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, he was a bit curious and wanted to see what the new Mercury Snake was in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is also somewhat fearful and worried. After all, the Mercury Snake is a sequence of the fate of the "monster" and involves the battle for the position of the gods. No one can be sure that the follow-up will be smooth and stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Dr. Allen, I don’t know if it’s lucky or unfortunate...Will Will Ansein be kind, on the other hand, will another Mercury snake? The discovery is on the other hand... and Will Ansett has nothing to do at the moment, telling the night that the night seems to be a bit cruel, I have always been able to understand the wild extraordinary... first quietly watching the development, not blending, not using, Is the best choice... Maybe I am reading the mistakes and thinking too much? Maybe Will Anthony is not a mercury snake at all! Maybe the child of Mrs. Allen’s wife is normal! Klein flashed a lot of thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She? That would be better." Allen said with great expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought and asked again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you had a nightmare recently? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Occasionally, but all are normal nightmares, no longer Will. Anthony, Sherlock, thank you for your guidance." Allen sincerely Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, no, this is not normal. As a keyboard powerhouse, my limited psychology common sense tells me that I occasionally dream of Will. It is normal for Anthony, which comes from the standard reaction after being stimulated. Since the other person has caused such a big trouble to you and left such a deep impression, it will definitely be mapped into a dream, so the correct Change is occasionally dreaming of Will Anthony, but the dream is not very clear, even just got up and forget the specific content, only know that there is one thing... Klein has decided some. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he heard a screaming voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously looked out of the hall, only to see the darkness of the air was blown away by the wind, and the pale yellow mist was swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The branches without leaves swayed, and the wind dragged a clear trace and went straight to the southeast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, everything returned to normal, calm as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beckland's winter is hard to see this kind of wind, at least I don't have any impression." Allen also looked out the window and said with a feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He temporarily forgot the matter and prepared to go to the underground shooting range to practice the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the waiter wearing the red vest passed through the warm, spring hall and came to his side, respectfully said:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moriarty, your friend is looking for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Klein asked with a slight sigh . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Icons Bernard." The red vest waiter replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deacon who often passively "haircuts"... What did he suddenly ask me for? Have new discoveries? Klein immediately went to the reception hall of the club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons pressed the hat that was raised by the fluffy hair and greeted him, pressing down the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The punitive found Patrick Jason Beria."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you find it?" Klein was half surprised and half curious Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the revelation of his divination, Jason Beria has always been dressed in a human skin, the true looks and breath are not determined, almost impossible It's so easy to find! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons circled around: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I just received this The message."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to a white bird that was parked on the tree outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird is leisurely cleaning his feathers with his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for Klein to ask again, Icons roughly described the passage of things:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The punishers found clues and determined the whereabouts of Jason, but the demon noticed the danger ahead of time. Before the encirclement and closing, they forced the two punishers to escape, which made the top of the storm church very angry. The singer 'Ais Sneek personally pursued it. You should have seen a gust of wind just now. That is what he caused. He is the Archbishop of the Baptist Parish of the Storm Church and one of the cardinals of the entire Storm Church." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds normal, but it feels weird... According to Mr. Essinger and my guess, this can also be understood as Jason’s “desire apostle” Leading the high sequence strong... Klein asked at his discretion: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure you found Jason Beria?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iconser’s expression became dignified, and the tone was rather oddly answered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;"I give it a try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He signals Klein to go out with him and board a spacious carriage parked on the street. Two "Mechanical Hearts" members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons took a breath and took out the ancient silver mirror with the demon pattern from the special pocket on the inside of the garment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the pre-order work, he said with a dark face:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Arrow Dess, my question is, the current position of Patrick Jason Beria."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a twist around the light, like the light after the rain, silver Inside the mirror, a scene emerges quickly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a riverboat with a sail that is towering, with a blue scorpion and gray hair, and the hair is neat The combed Jason Beria pressed the cap and erected the coat neckline, hurriedly entering the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He really wants to escape from Beckland! 'The singer of God' seems to be rushing to the dock area..." A "Mechanical Heart" female member Said awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too easy to expose? Klein is full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, only the answer to the question option, mistakes or lying will encounter terrible punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the mirror outlines the words that are red and bloody:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you The man you like is full of cockroaches, or fades off the skin, only flesh and blood, or becomes a monster, but can communicate, will you like him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A shameful question...wait, man? Klein leaned over his head and looked at ICON. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons slowly spit out his breath:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but I will kill myself Drop him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"very honest." A new combination of words emerged on the surface of the silver mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... This quiz game is a public execution... Klein wants to reach out and cover his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the other two "Mechanical Hearts" members without any abnormalities, or pretending that there was no abnormal expression, hesitating and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I always feel too easy, maybe that is not true Jason Beria?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sen Beria pointed to him." Icons intends to lose the silver mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought for a few seconds and organized the language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, my real It means that we have to abandon some of the inherent judgments. We are looking for the 'desire apostle', not Jason Beria, and the two are not necessarily identical.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what I have to offer as a detective. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the King's Road, a luxury carriage left the Kingdom House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage is covered with carpets, furniture such as beds, sofas and tables, like a moving room.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Nicholas, who is wearing a dark blue admiral suit, is carrying a crystal-polished cup and drinking bloody Ormill wine.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tastes the wine and thinks and says:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Invite Earl of Hall to be a guest tomorrow, I want to talk to him about improving the factory. The remuneration of workers, the improvement of their working hours, and the revision of the "Poverty Alleviation Law" are all the motions he has recently pushed forward. He should be very interested. Oh, how does the night church suddenly care about this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When inviting, you can first disclose to the Earl of Hall what I want to discuss. The property restrictions of the election are necessary and cannot be lowered. Otherwise, those who drive The guys of a large number of workers will certainly occupy more seats, and the recent attacks on invalid constituencies will be suppressed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brushing, next to the secretary The record of the Duke of Nigan was recorded quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, the Duke of Nigan sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did this, too For the status of the nobility, but there are more and more people who are useless among us, and even many people owe money to those rich."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The carriage did not turn in the direction of Queens and went straight ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the largest land aristocrat outside the king, the Duke of Nigan has many mistresses, but in the relatively conservative Lun Kingdom, this is easily attacked by political opponents. The place, so even if you are the Duke, when he goes to the mistress, he has to sneak, but it seems to give him more fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today he is going to the most beloved mistress in the last two or three years, a girl who just turned 20. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking out a bottle of medicinal powder made from mummified corpse powder, Duke of Nigan couldn’t help but touch the ornament hanging on his neck, it was a dark blue Colored thumb-sized conch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
