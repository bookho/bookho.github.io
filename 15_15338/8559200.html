			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knight who knows the dragon language and even uses the dragon language at the critical stage of growth... No wonder the "psychological alchemy club" wants to get him left The notes... Audrey has abruptly converging his thoughts, happily and earnestly communicating with Michel Deuter the problems of grammar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, they ended their discussion of this note, and Michelle began to introduce the subsequent collections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, the visit gradually comes to an end, Audrey originally planned to make a purchase request next time, so that things are not so purposeful, but friendly The kind atmosphere and the natural nature of the words made her keenly think that this is an opportunity, so the ability to "lie" the necklace made the cheeks embarrassed with shame:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Deyte, the Sauron royal helmet from the White Rose War is a good item to commemorate my ancestors. I take the liberty to ask, can I buy it from you? The notes during the Twenty Years War, because I admire the knights who insist on the island of Sunia, I also want to have it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know this is A polite request, but I hope you can understand my mood, of course, you have the right to refuse. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes are turning, she is dodging, and half is deliberately half-realistic to make herself look guilty, shy and pitiful.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle suddenly moved his mind out of his mind, and his voice said quietly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a collector, I don't Will sell my collection. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tone and vocabulary are not strong enough... The information collected previously shows that he is a gentleman who pays attention to his reputation and buys him directly with money. The collection is probably a way he can't accept... "Psychological Alchemy" does not find someone else to complete this task. On the one hand, it just gives me a contribution. On the other hand, it should be the attitude of Mr. Associate Professor in this respect... A way... Before Audrey came to visit here, she had carefully prepared different plans based on the information she had learned. After thinking a little, she opened the topic and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Deuter, I heard that you are seeking to establish an antiquities research institute within the University of Stowe? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, this is my goal in recent years. Michelle revisited Audrey and replied calmly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey sketched a light smile:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very interested in this research, and I am very respectful to you, I hope to see you reach your wish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I want to donate 1,000 pounds of cash to your college at Stoen University, just in the vicinity of 2000 acres of land and a good estate. In order to initially establish a public welfare fund for the collection and protection of antiquities, I know that this is not enough, but I will lobby the ladies and gentlemen I know and let them make certain contributions. (Note 1)<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Deit, you are the most professional antiquities collection and researcher I know. Are you willing to be the person in charge of this charity fund? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2000 acres of land near the university, which is worth almost 6,000 pounds, plus the manor and cash, Miss Audrey donated nearly 10,000 pounds... With such a charity fund for collecting and protecting antiquities, the difficulty of applying for our institute will be minimized... Michelle is silent for a few seconds, revealing a sincere smile and solemnly saluting:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Premier Miss, your attention to academics touched me, its light is enough to compare with your beauty and your cultivation, I think I have no reason to refuse your invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have transcribed the contents of that note, I will send it and your helmet to your house tonight, this is a sincere friend. Gifts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Success! Audrey was happy in her heart and only wanted to praise herself, but her face was bleak and there was no rude behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my pleasure," she said earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the two collections are certainly not worth 10,000 pounds, she will not lose anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her plan, this proposal contains three purposes, three gains! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first objective is to get the items, complete the commission, and smoothly obtain the "hypnotist" potion formula from the "mental alchemy club". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second priority is to protect and promote their reputation, status and image by donating academic research to protect ancient objects. This is the majority of the wealthy of most nobles. What she is doing, even without today's donation, Audrey will contribute 3,000 pounds or more to various charitable organizations every year. Therefore, she believes that Father Hall will not block a small amount of real estate under his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third priority is a foundation dedicated to the collection and protection of antiquities. It is easy to access some valuable historical materials and mysterious objects. Audrey does not need Personally, just sitting at home, you may be able to harvest things that are helpful to you. It is equivalent to using 10,000 pounds to incite more funds and establish your own "power." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if Michelle Deit does not accept this exchange, she has other plans: the Hall family in the Kingdom Higher Education Commission There are also aristocratic friends she knows. As long as the associate professor has the corresponding needs, she will find ways to satisfy him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Audrey did not like this way too much, and always felt that it was not glamorous and seemed to harm the public interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking about the good things, Audrey stayed for a while and chatted for about a quarter of an hour, so that the ending of the matter was not at all awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she left the Michelle home and took the carriage back to the Hall family in the town of Stowe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 8 o'clock in the evening, she received the helmet of the royal family of Solon and the notes during the twenty-year war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey wears white gauze gloves, sit at the desk with great interest, put the helmet aside, and carefully read the contents of the notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found that the things recorded above are very fragmentary. The early stage was mainly how the knight who was stationed on the ancient Elf Island learned how to brew Sunia blood wine, how to chase the surrounding Ms., how to pass the boring time, in the middle and late period, enter the 20-year war stage, to curse the Fossac, blame the companions, consider adhering to the plan and so on, and end after the first loss of the island of Sunia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Besides the grammar has the habit of approximating the dragon language, there aren't too many other problems. I can't see where the clues are hidden..." Audrey Frowning brows and closing the notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, she used the occult method to check and still did not gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made her not too willing to waste time, so she was handed over to the "Psychological Alchemy Club." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the electric turn, she suddenly had a new idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Mr. 'Inverted man' always thinks about the problem from different aspects of the matter, gives advice, should I study it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔...change From a point of view, first assume that the content of the note is no problem, then the 'psychological alchemy' is the pursuit itself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What special is it? It was not found... It belongs to a knight who is used to using the dragon language, what the knight must have experienced ... divination, right, divination! Maybe you can use the divination method, use this note to find the last whereabouts or initial trace of the knight, and this is likely to be related to a dragon!<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since it is a dragon, there is no small possibility that it is a spiritual dragon. It is a representative of the 'audience' approach. The clues related to it are indeed worthy of the 'psychological alchemy'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Audrey, this idea is very good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey's eyes Bright, it seems to hide the obvious flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but lean over and looked at the golden retriever dog next to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi took a look at the owner, Wang Wangsheng:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Audrey, Do you want me to praise you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, don't need..." Audrey turned back in shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, she found an important issue, that is, she will not divination, or the accuracy of the enlightenment obtained by divination is very low! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
