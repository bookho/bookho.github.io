Dunn repeated the question just now, leaning back against the back of the chair. The hands that are handed over are loose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein recalled the previous drafts:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am before summing up me The experience, I think the name of the potion itself contains a set of rules that help us master the potions and avoid the rules of negative influence, and when we follow this set of rules to deal with things, it seems to become the corresponding "Professional people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The same, these rules are implied, no one directly tells you, can only sum up from the corresponding profession, Then correct it according to different effect feedback."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, when I became a true divinationist in the Divination Club, I had my own 'divinationist' After the Code, the slang and illusion that bothered me disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what I want to understand."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After saying this, Klein secretly vomited, except that he did not directly point out "play", he should say  said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哎, I only hope that the captain will not say that I have such a clear idea when the church asks people to ask, which will make me pay more attention... ...plus the "divination" approach and the factors of the Antigonus family, there may be no small troubles at the time... However, the captain has also seen many storms, people with rich experience and low wisdom. Once he realizes "playing the law", he will surely notice the concealment of the church on the corresponding issues, know what he should say, and should not say anything... Klein has a lot of thoughts and confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he quickly made up his mind and had a plan:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the captain is like this I haven't been able to understand the "playing the law", or I have not noticed the concealment of the church, then I will wake him up directly before submitting a special application! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, let's make a temptation first, and make sure that the next step...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den is quiet After the description of Klein, the gray eyes became more secluded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He silent for ten seconds, reached for the forehead, then picked up the pipe and sniffed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the sniffing, he seemed to have forgotten the rules of the night squad and handed out the matchbox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue-and-white smoke slowly rises, and Dunn closes his eyes and seems to be tasting tobacco. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he opened his eyes and smiled at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sorry, forget that you are not smoking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Smoking is harmful to health." Klein replied in a serious manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng took the pipe and thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I seem to understand some Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Captain, you didn't understand anything! Don't wander in my dreams anyway! Klein didn't ask for a question, only outlined a gentle smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, you don't need to take too long to submit a special application..." Dunn took a deep breath of tobacco with a hint of mint, half-joking half-sighed and said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you be tomorrow? Klein replied in his heart, took out his pocket watch and looked at the time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, I have to go to the old Neil, today's occult The course is about to begin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closing the door of the captain's office, Klein was in a good mood to the ladder leading to the underground. When passing by the civilian staff office, he saw two men and one woman and two strangers inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newcomer... Klein nodded thoughtfully and added a sentence to his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After two days, within this week, submit a special application to the captain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then through a series of examinations, become the sequence 8 "The clown"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quiet and quiet underground passage, Klein turned to the arsenal , pushed open the door to the guard room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to you?" He scared when he saw the old Neil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil is languid, his face is white, and he is constantly yawning:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Some constipation recently, I tried a ritual magic to solve this problem last night. As a result, I didn't sleep well all night and went to the bathroom. Later, I almost fell asleep on the toilet."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the constipation problem has been solved... Seeing that it is not a big problem, Klein suddenly wants to laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he restrained himself and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you better now? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he was concerned to let the left tooth squint twice, using "Ling" to observe the health of the old Neil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow color of the digestive system, the orange color of the detoxification site, a bit bleak and mixed, but fortunately, within a reasonable range... Klein secretly sighed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's okay, I'm looking for Frye to have a diarrhea." Old Neil yawned like a smoker. "Mystery of today." The course is self-study, and the content of the last two or three days is anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein politely said, "Or I am here to guard." Weapons library, self-study mystery course, do you go to the lounge to sleep?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil instantly straightens his back and squints:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Moretti, you really are the conscience of the night who is second only to Frye!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The arsenal is handed over to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the blanket on his lap and rushed out of the guard room, leaving Klein a People are in a daze there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Blackthorn Security Company received a single additional business, Escort a wealthy businessman to go to the dock and trade, Leonard, Cohenli easily completed, earned a lot of extra money, so Klein quite envious. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he still went deep into the mystery, practicing the gunfare, and was madly "tortured" by the ignorant Gao Wen teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, call... Klein opened his mouth and gasped for a long time before he recovered his ability to take a bath and change clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Gao Wenjia, he continued to be busy, spending 2 Souls hired a rental carriage, passing through the remaining ten houses with red chimneys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the last dark red chimney was far away from his sight, Klein’s expression became very dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'red chimney' house I saw in my divination has not changed the ranks of tenants recently... this way, things are in trouble, one thousand six Seven hundred houses, I don't know when I can check them out... Oh, this thing, I can't find someone to help. After all, only when I face the goal, I have the spiritual familiarity..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well, go back and sort out the information, and check the route every day according to the planning of the far and near areas!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein inspires himself and keeps the frustration away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the decision, he was planning to tell the driver to turn to Narcissus Street and suddenly found it very close to the residence of the Azko instructor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Before Mr. Azick went to travel, he wrote to me and said that he would come back this week, but did not mention the specific number, just to follow the road and see one Look, leave a note to him, um, rent a carriage 2 soler for 1 hour, now it’s almost time to go, just take Mr. Azick’s home as the end point, then change the public carriage...” Klein quickly made Decide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After four minutes, he walked off the carriage and went outside the Azick house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grade here is significantly better than the Narcissus Street, but not as good as the Howth Street, with a lawn in front of the house and a small garden at the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮! Ding! Ding! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pulled the rope at the door and knocked the bell inside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaiting for a moment, he heard a footstep coming in, and then saw the door opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azuk, a soft-skinned bronze of the five senses, appeared in front of Klein, because at home, he only casually wore white shirts, brown vests and brown trousers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein? I am trying to write to you." Azke warmly greeted, "I just got home last night."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a deep look at the tiny black squat under his right ear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Az Mr. Ke, I found your clues in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Azick’s expression became excited, with a sullen look They have lost their indifference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, go in and say." Klein looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azk quickly nodded, letting the position open and letting the guests enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He locked the door and led Klein to the living room on the first floor and sat down on the soft sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What clues did you find?" he couldn't wait to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t expect to meet Mr. Azko today, organizing the language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I recently accepted the commission and went to the abandoned castle outside the town of Ramd to get rid of a resentment.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ramd...” Az Gram replied this name in a low voice, and the brow wrinkled a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at each other’s expression and slowed down the speed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the process, we found some things, so we went to the town to do an in-depth investigation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A town citizen claimed to have the portrait of the first Baron Ramd I tried to sell it to me. I watched the painting with curiosity and found the person in the portrait. Except for the hairstyle, the facial features are very similar to Mr. Azke. Even the black skull below the ear has the same position and The same size."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The townspeople, under my interrogation, confessed that the painting was a work more than 40 years ago, but the object of imitation is indeed from obsolescence. The old castle is indeed a portrait ancient painting dug out there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, our unique ability has a preliminary identification lie Skills, and this technique tells me that the townspeople did not lie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick leaned forward , Holding his hands to pay quite a while did not speak, he has maintained silence silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After five or six minutes, he vomited: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
