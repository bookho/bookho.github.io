			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as the gunshot, Anderson’s entire body suddenly slammed down and forcibly escaped the bullet in an awkward manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to understand the situation, Klein has jumped to the other side, while opening the vision, pulled out the revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, his first reaction was that Anderson’s guy was hunting too much last night, and he retaliated. He just wanted to scream, “I don’t know him. It has nothing to do with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, at the table next to Anderson Hood, a strong man wearing a shirt and cuffs discards the knife and fork. Suddenly, a double-barreled shotgun with a bullet already on the bottom of the chair was slammed into the ground, and the trigger was pulled in a condescending posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had almost no time difference between the action and the hotel owner’s shooting, just because the steps were more and slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bounced out, countless tiny particles shot the ground into a honeycomb, Anderson, although tumbling in time, circumvented most of it, but still was swept some, side Suddenly became bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is about to shoot the brawny man with a double-barreled shotgun, helping Anderson Hood to get rid of the danger, only to find that the other person is the same as the hotel owner, his expression is stunned. Full of surprises and fears, there is a feeling of finally waking up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, they are not real attackers... Kline’s mind stopped the finger trying to pull the trigger and his eyes quickly swept the restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the vision did not find out, his left thumb immediately smashed the first joint of the index finger twice, opening the observation of the "line of the spirit." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the ladies and gentlemen in the restaurant had stood up in panic and shot toward the exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing by the tumbling Anderson, a handsomely dressed lady suddenly stopped and opened the dark glass bottle that was tightly held in her hand. The liquid inside poured into the strongest hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the liquid was contaminated, the surface quickly turned black and suffered strong corrosion. Anderson squinted and slammed up to avoid the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the quiet and lovely lady, the gentleman holding the newspaper, the waiter wearing a red vest, and the five-year-old child with candy on their hands at the same time Anderson Hood launched an attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flour, lit matches, fruit knives, hot coffee, high-concentration alcoholic beverages come one after another, and everyone in the entire hotel restaurant seems to have only one The goal is to kill Anderson Hood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this situation where there is no extraordinary ability to participate but is extremely dangerous, Anderson has been caught in a difficult to get rid of, and sometimes jumps, sometimes kicks the table, sometimes By igniting the goods in advance, they barely avoided the key and did not suffer serious injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein also found an unusual place:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restaurant corner was decorated The seat in the shelter of the sex cabinet clearly spreads the fine and illusory black "line of the spirit", but there is no movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is quite unusual in the hall filled with chaos and panic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real attacker who planned this "passer murder" was sitting there? From the confusing, incomprehensible, horrified, and confusing look of the hotel owner and waiter customers after attacking Anderson, they did not become awkward. This is another level of manipulation... illusion, the emotional seed of the “desire apostle”, or Say, another impact on the spiritual level? Klein suddenly flashed a flash of light, and immediately stepped forward, hit a customer with a cream in his mouth, and opened the channel for Anderson Hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strongest hunter immediately rolled out of the encirclement from this direction, followed Klein and ran back to the second floor of the hotel, leaning back against the corner of the stairs The wall, the big mouth gasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, the real situation is that people who are riddled with dooms don’t want to do hunting pirates... Klein just gave up trying to control the plan with the “spiritual line” because he thought of it. One possibility: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road people seem to have been planted with hints, or suffered a manipulative manipulation, and will suddenly and suddenly attack Anderson, which is related to "desire The extraordinary power of the apostle is not too consistent, because the attacker's attack is directional, accurate, and has obvious traces of preparation, and Klein has previously heard the name of a sequence 4 potion recipe is "manipulator"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, according to the statement of the "psychologist" released in "squirming hunger", Klein has always suspected that Toskat Island has "mental alchemy society" "Related tasks or characters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus the spiritual suggestion, the manipulation of the mind level is quite consistent with the characteristics of the "audience" approach, and Klein also thought that the "manipulator" is likely to belong to the audience. "Belongs to the "Dragon", the outline of the matter is clearer: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Psychological Alchemy Association does have an important stronghold in Toskat Island and dispatched The demigod of the sequence 4, this demigod influenced some pirates, let them unconsciously help him to do something, and these pirates unfortunately became the funders of Anderson Hood last night, so the real investment this morning People are on the door! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controlling his own expression, Klein looked at Anderson, said indifferently: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It should be which of the pirates last night was involved in the secret half-god on the island.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think is the middle sequence? Can extraordinary people do it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It won't be so unlucky..." Anderson's voice is getting smaller and smaller, and he turned to be awkward. "Sure enough, those guys are controlled." It’s innocent, but fortunately, I didn’t fight back, or else I’m going to be the main criminal in a shocking case, and I’m on a reward! At that time, the trouble is big, and I can only do pirates. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s mouth twitched slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you have just been controlled, there is How will the pirates of extraordinary ability, or the punitives and pastors of the storm church, develop? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am already dead." Anderson spread his hand and immediately said, "You mean, he didn't want to kill me. Just a warning?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean seriously pointed to the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, you still have a chance." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, go apologize."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go and see what the demigod really wants to do . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apologize?" Anderson's face wrinkled and said, "In the foggy sea, my reputation is still very loud."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein said nothing, standing straight, patted the jacket, ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Anderson saved it, grabbed him in front of him, came to the stairs and shouted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry! I am wrong!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anything can be discussed! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop for a second, he repeated it again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry! I'm wrong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is something to discuss!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪! A slow applause sounded on the first floor, and a figure appeared at the entrance to the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the slight footsteps, the figure gradually went to the corner, but Klein instinctively, subconsciously removed his eyes, and did not seem to know the long What it looks like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is terrible... Well, now is not face-to-face hypnosis, so I can detect it, but if it is directly targeted, the result is hard to believe... I will be affected now, according to Miss Justice, it is the other party through the collective subconscious The sea came quietly to my consciousness island and made a certain degree of operation? Klein was a bit stunned and suddenly had the urge to leave and return to the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the silent “give” given by this demigod? Klein generally understood that the other party wanted to communicate with Anderson alone, so he did not resist, walked out of the stairs, and entered the room of his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After less than five minutes, Anderson rang his door and looked sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Talk about it?" Klein asked inadvertently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson focuses on: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call...Yes, he asked me to help him Something, specifically, can't tell others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember what he looks like?" Klein asked deliberately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson thought carefully and suddenly frowned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not remember..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough...you said that you just got 1600 pounds, and you got a half-god, it’s not worth it... Klein sighed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you leave tomorrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, that thing is not urgent, first solve the bad luck Question." Anderson replied without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein no longer said more, pointing to the floor:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you still going to breakfast? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson is a glimpse, and immediately smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What troubles can't affect eating and sleeping!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two went down to the first floor and found that the waiter was quietly packing up the broken items, and the boss and the customers had completely forgotten what had just happened.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After breakfast, Anderson continues to go out, busy collecting royalties and feature money, and To make some preparations, Klein stayed in the hotel room, concealing the spirituality that overflowed after the promotion, and experimented with the extraordinary ability of the "Master of Secrets" with small bugs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At half past two in the afternoon, he entered the fog ahead of time and personally rehearsed for the upcoming Tarot. After all, Mr. Fool’s cloud was very light and tapped the “hidden” Jia Delia.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit in the position of "fool", Klein made a drill based on the three sets of beats that he had figured out in the past few days, and two of them need to mobilize this piece. A little bit of space, two have to rely on props, so the whole process should go, he must be fixed in advance, skilled I can't reveal the signs of oysters at critical moments.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Klein took a breath and decided things.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he has a "world", no need for items, and directly sees the numerous fine black lines that have spread from the other side.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "With the power of the mysterious space above the fog, the items that are present have a certain spirituality... so they have the 'line of the spirit', and in the real world, there is no lifeless thing. "Klein skillfully manipulated those black lines and quickly and completely controlled the "world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, he can not only make the "world" The expression is more delicate, the reaction is more like a real person, and it can make the spiritual fluctuation of the cockroach close to nature, no longer dead!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these, he is also like a double player Directly obtained the visual, hearing, and other senses of the "world"!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
