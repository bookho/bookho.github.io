			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, Klein sat in the easy chair of the living room, and took the warmth of the fireplace and picked up the information that Essinger’s assistant had just sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his morning thoughts were praised by the big detective, Kaslana immediately said that he also needed a similar information, and Stuart was low. He sighed and said that he had calmed and calmed from the case of Klein in the face of Atruna. He believed that he was a good detective, but he did not expect that he would be so good. At the same time, he told Klein that if he needs manpower and needs help, he can go to him. He knows many friends in the detective circle of Beckland. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger Stanton also promised to contact the police immediately to try to provide the necessary information to the detectives before dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very reputable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the next Tarot meeting, I have to ask the "world" to ask the little "sun", ask the characteristics of the sequence 6 "demon", and ask the sequence What kind of ability does the extraordinary person have... I didn’t want to mix it before, I forgot to collect the corresponding information. Now that I have decided to help, I have to be prepared to avoid the danger and I don’t know how it happened... Klein sinks for a few seconds and lowers his head. Under the light of the gas lamp, look at the unbroken serial killings of the entire Lun Kingdom in the last two decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is much less than he expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland has four, and the other cities have a total of five, adding up to a total of nine! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, although the world has not yet seen the concept of DNA testing, and lacks many necessary criminal investigation techniques, it has been shaped by the imperial 'Fingerprint', and there are also extraordinary means of psychic, divination, dreaming, etc. In the case of a single murder, without involving aristocrats, rich people, officials, the police department often does not turn to the extraordinary squad of the three churches. The impact of serial killings is very bad, and it is easy to cause panic. They will certainly make the most sensible choices... In this way, only a few serial killings that have not been broken in 20 years are reasonable and logical.” Klein quickly I want to understand why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He converges on his thoughts and looks through the case together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of information to be able to divinate, he initially selected two serial killings that may be related to the current incident, intending to make a preliminary entry point . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A case occurred four years ago. There were five victims, all single and nieces with a child who were abused before they died, but Lack of traces of relationships with people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsible police at the time thought that the murderer must know the prostitutes, otherwise it would be impossible to accurately select the type of single with a child from the people living nearby. With the frequent visits of several prostitutes, some suspects were identified, but in the end they did not find the real murderer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the file was only slightly mentioned, Klein clearly saw that they invited the extraordinary people of the three churches to help, but unfortunately, still Did not solve the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the extraordinary ability of the "abyss" approach, it can be seen that women have had traces of degeneration, do not violate occultism, and see that the other is a prostitute, but it does not make sense. I can see that the other person is currently single, and there is only one child... The police's thinking is correct. Where is the problem? The real murderer, like me, can fight against dreams, divination, psychic, and evade the investigation of low- or mid-sequence nights or punitives? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that although several churches do not lack understanding of the "serial killer", the other party may have other adventures! From his own point of view, Klein picked out some problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am analyzing them in the same way...I have not lived up to the name of Moriarty...He laughed at himself and decided that the priority is still It was the four suspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, let Mr. Stanton determine the current address and status of the suspects through the police, please ask Stuart to find someone to assist, I will not directly Come out, so as not to encounter the official extraordinary, and so on to find out the situation, and then collect the suspect's personal belongings, to carry out metaphysical reasoning above the fog." Klein quickly drafted the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second case occurred 11 years ago, when four cases of corpses appeared one after another. Originally, these cases were not merged until the police handled The corpse's tactics were suspected and confirmed as serial killings. The victims were those who came home late at night, and there were men and women who were not robbed of money and had no relationship with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the most precious time, the case has not been able to find clues to the suspect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a problem caused by mistakes. If you ask the 'Psychic' to help soon, the resentment of the deceased will even gather around the murderer... Of course It is also possible that the murderer even kills the soul, just like now... The body of the deceased should have only ashes left, it is difficult to start..." Klein licked his forehead and saw that the sky was dark, not for the time being. Then think about the case, get up from the easy chair and leave Minsk Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has something to do tonight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to the southern part of the bridge, to the harvest church in Yuehuahua Street, to find Bishop Utravsky, and strive to get the "pharmacist" formula - this thing Whether he has been divined is dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Klein, it would be very helpful if there was a "pharmacist" to be a man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will be injured, will get sick, will encounter enemies who can cause harm to him, a "pharmacist" that can be found at any time will be his strong backing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning around in the Eastern District, he changed the dress of Klein to take the steam subway, cross the Tasok River, and arrived at the southern part of the bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, the dim light along the subway and the corresponding gas lamps constitute an impressive scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change to the public carriage, Klein came to the rose garden, and found the small harvest church without identification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This golden church has a striking spire and a life emblem engraved on the façade, surrounded by symbols such as wheat ears, flowers and springs. A simple baby, which is very different from the surrounding buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the lights in the church are dim and there seems to be no believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sneaked from the side, carefully smearing his face with oil paint, rather than simply relying on the ability to create hallucinations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church hall, rows of seats are neatly placed, at the top is a huge emblem of life, with a candle lit on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top row of seats has a 40-year-old tall man wearing a brown priest's suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is sitting there, just like a hill, giving a great sense of oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man wears a bishop's soft hat, his eyebrows are light and sparse, and his eyes, cheeks, and mouth have obvious wrinkles. At this time, he is tightly closed. Eyes, clasped hands, against the squat, seems to be doing the most devout repentance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he opened his eyes and revealed a light blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The church of the mother god will not reject anyone, why don't you go to the main entrance?" The 40-year-old old man did not look up, quietly and quietly . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the Uttrasky Bishop?" Klein walked out from the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall man wearing a brown bishop’s uniform replied in a warm and warm manner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like others to call my priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"French Uttraski."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good Mr. Bishop.” Klein deliberately laughed. “Your name and your height tell me that you are a Fossac, why do you believe in the Mother Earth?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Uttrasky bishop slowly raised his head and looked at the life emblem in front of him, saying with emotion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was born In the inter-sea coast, there is a man who is crazy about fighting and killing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was indeed a man of the Fossac Empire... Klein was invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inter-sea is the natural dividing line between Lun, Intis and Fossac, the east coast belongs to Lun, the west bank mostly belongs to Intis, north It is the famous port city of the Fossac Empire, for example, due to more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
