			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quiet church under the night is especially beautiful, and it is complemented by the red moon that hangs high in the air and cools the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard entered his own single room, took off two red gloves and threw them on the wooden table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat with a face, sitting in front of the patterned glass window, facing away from the outside, bathing in the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dozen or so seconds, he suddenly whispered, almost gnashing his teeth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You are a 'parasitic'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard’s voice faintly echoes in his own ear, suppressing obvious anger, tension, sorrow and Scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, a slightly old voice sounded directly in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You can say that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do? Parasitic in my body, take my life? Or wait for me to be strong, directly swallow my Extraordinary features, like cultivating a bottle of humanoid potion?" Leonard's voice is very low, but the speed is not slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly old voice in his mind laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am your adventure Ah, don’t you always think so? Think of yourself as one of the protagonists of this great era...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, you are not as usual Since you are so arrogant, you are always on the lookout for me. Hey, after I taught you to play the law, you didn’t bother to explore it. It was very simple and very easy to try. It took a long time to digest it, and Deliberately concealing, not pursuing the 'nightmare' potion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you meet the 'real creator' son, you are willing to promote the sequence 7 and regret it. Illusion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard, you think about it, I don’t know the Goddess Church? When I deal with them, the so-called Chanis is still Not born.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not know the Goddess of the Night to the parasite 'Having a certain understanding, I will not think that 'Red Gloves' will grasp some secrets, in case of the penetration of high sequence extraordinary people?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I have prevented you from joining 'red gloves' '??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression changed briefly for a few moments, and Leonard eventually returned to silence, saying nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice in his mind laughed again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you feel better than the real age? Aging? No, I can live for at least 100 years, and I am not in a hurry to take possession of the host.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for your extraordinary characteristics, hey, we can’t replace it at all. In a similar way, I swallow it, it is equal to drinking poison, it will become semi-mad, it will increase the probability of losing control, do you think I will do this?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' The night is in the same category as 'Giant' and 'Death', and the extraordinary path I am in is aimed at 'apprentices' and is 'divination'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Leonard looked at the figure that he was illuminated by the blushing moon, quietly thinking for a while, and asked again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want to do? What is your purpose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly old voice in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I have not told you Have you ever been?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have suffered severe trauma, I must have a host to recover slowly, and I have to avoid a terrible enemy...night, night The Goddess Church is a good choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard raised his head and looked at the ceiling for a few seconds, calmly saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you going to be discovered by the Archbishop, Senior Deacon, or some seals?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly old voice replied casually: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the 'parasitic' can be found so easily, today's senior deacon called Sesima does not Will only be a reminder, do not take you to the inspection.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the 'parasitics' also have traces, the Goddess Church has a way to confirm this, but that It's quite complicated, it's quite troublesome, it will cause certain losses, bring about no danger, and may even affect their goddess. Therefore, when you become a senior deacon, you are eligible to participate in the top-level meeting of the church and get in touch with some level 0. Don't worry about this before the seal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, I should have recovered and embarked on my own journey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard’s expression listened intently, after a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you have a terrible enemy? He is Who?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly old voice slammed: <br /><br />&nb Sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know his name, but I know his last name..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?" Leonard Asked one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly old voice suddenly becomes low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amon."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bridge South District, 46 Hewan Avenue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The host who is enjoying dinner hears the ringing of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only maid came to the door, through the cat's eye above the door lock, saw a policeman wearing a black and white uniform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened the door and asked with some fear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr., what can be done? Help you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This police officer is Kline after disguise, he is confirming the companion of vampire Emlin White, in order to try the active performance, Those who live at No. 48, Hewan Avenue, the consignor of the Stuart mission, are obeying monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, a law-abiding monster! Although this sounds a bit wrong, it is a bit funny, but it is the reaction of my real thoughts... Kline emphasized in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police uniform on his body is not a custom-made fake, which is a product of ordinary clothes with illusion effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" is going to do what the magician should do! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Klein did not monitor 48 River Bay Avenue because he believed that Emlin White's companions had already moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a monster, as a non-human race, in the case of a companion who has been missing for several days, transferring the residence is the most basic operation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They must be wary of Emlin White. It is captured by official extraordinary organizations such as night servants and punitives. It must be assumed that the other party may confess at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what Klein has to do is a "questionnaire." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He keeps the underlying police in the face of the arrogance of ordinary citizens, does not take off his hat, and slightly lifts his chin:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I have something to ask your master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid panicked in, and soon took a 30-year-old wearing a thick shirt The man came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police officer, what do you want to ask?" the male owner asked slightly tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stood at the door and looked inside: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know No. 48 "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know." The male owner snorted. "What happened to them?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are involved in a case, you have to tell me everything you know honestly." Klein squinted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face also made a certain camouflage, and attached a little illusion effect, in order to separate from the big detective Sherlock Moratti. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male owner suddenly lost:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder they rushed away more than a month ago. ... Most of the residents of River Bay Avenue and nearby neighborhoods know the Whites and their sons. It is a handsome young man with a somewhat eccentric personality.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Mr. is an excellent physician who specializes in the use of various pharmacy and bloodletting therapies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood therapy?" Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, although this is considered by many newspapers and magazines to be an ancient medical technique that has no effect, the people who have been treated by Mr. White have basically recovered, but Mr. White also said that except for him, the bloodletting treatments of other doctors are fraudulent." The male owner made a point of view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood therapy is accumulating food for yourself? The only thing that really works is the pharmacy... This vampire family relies on bloodletting therapy to help people cure the disease, while collecting "food" rewards. If the patient is not much, or the blood is very unhealthy, consider going to a far hospital for stealing blood. The blood in the drink? Relative to the identity of the monster, they are really obeying the law... Klein has a clear understanding of the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed that the observed color change of the emotion told him that the other party did not lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male host saw the police officer did not refute himself and continued: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. White and his wife They are very good and kind people. Although they can't cure those really serious people, they are already very good doctors for those of us who live nearby...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is their child Emlin involved in the case? This young man is too silent, seems to look down on us, always hiding at home, do not know what to do... Police officer, are you hot? It’s so cold outside.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it’s just a simple night out... Klein wiped the sweat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For this case, I have been around for a long time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, according to the designed "questionnaire", he learned from all aspects The White couple and their son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked on the door after another, asked, summed up all the answers, and concluded that the White family was really kind, harmonious, and obeying the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not like a description of a vampire... Klein looked up at the red moon that penetrated the clouds and planned to make a final confirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted off his illusion and started divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there was no danger, he went to the side and climbed into the house at 48 Hewan Avenue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because others don’t know who was taken by Emlin White, they will always be afraid to follow the official extraordinary to “visit”, but Klein understands that What is going on, so I don't worry about traps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the second floor, he used the moonlight to see the messy things in each room, and many things were not taken away. Through these, it is enough to imagine the main people leaving. In a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even found some precious books on herbal medicine in the study, including many popular folk recipes in the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While walking, Klein entered a bedroom, and a black shadow followed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked and thought that he had suffered an ambush, and he almost had to make a snap and ignite the match that was thrown outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, no attacks occurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blushing moonlight passed through the window and filled the room, and Klein finally saw what the shadows were. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have no spiritual brilliance, are big or small dolls! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
