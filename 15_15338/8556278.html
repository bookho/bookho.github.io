			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick’s axe wraps around the silver awns, slamming the river on the murals, smashing the walls and smashing the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his blow, the end-to-end river was completely disconnected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was expecting the loop to be broken, and exploring the scene of all the members of the squad jumping out of the temple, the "hunter" Colin figure flashed and came In front of him, he is sulking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This half God's sword tip is still hanging down, but the hand holding the handle is obviously stronger than just. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek recalls the rhetoric of the wisdom of the members of the Tarot Society, half of the "doubt" and half of the "fear": /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a black shadow from here, the lord, really! Like a child!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Colin Iliat's eyes did not move away and asked another player:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heinham, have you seen it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team members of Heinham’s expedition team subconsciously moved closer to the chief direction, steadfastly shaking their heads:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I didn't see anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin's light blue eyes suddenly shimmered, highlighting two dark green Complex symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just watched Deric quietly for four or five seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he took his eyes back and said nothing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is your first It’s normal to have an illusion because of tension.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, you follow me, I think you will be calmer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Chief Excellency. Dairik promised without hesitation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the previous attempt, he initially confirmed that the murals were not related to the key points.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Redemption Rose" suggested by Mr. "The Fool" should still have a deeper meaning, not so simple... Dairik holds the "Hurricane Axe" and walks silently in the Chief Section Lin's side.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the things are not much different from the several explorations in his memory, everyone repeats the past, the sixth arrival has been arranged In the final hall of the altar, I found the yellow-haired boy Jack, who was curled up in the shadows.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the phrase "Help me...help me..." After seeing the obvious child figure, "The Demon Hunter" Colin slightly nodded and nodded, and the attention of bet on Dairik Berger was recovered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he considered the language and prepared to speak, Dairik suddenly asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; save you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little boy Jack shows an excited expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save me, save me, send me Come back home! send me home! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is your home? Deric asked again in curiosity and fear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing this situation, Colin closed his mouth and tightened his palm.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little boy Jack weakly raises his hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My home, my home is in the port of Enmat! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His reaction did not cause the suspicion of the "hunter" Colin, because the powerful "six-member council" chief also did not see the sea, only from some of the preserved books, this is bigger than the lake. I do not know how many times the water body, and the term "port". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Emmette Port" spit out in the mouth of a strange boy seems to have launched a new world picture in front of Colin, which makes it hard to find the Silver City. In the future, he forgot something else in a moment, blurted out and debuted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, or you, how did you come here?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little boy Jack reveals the expression of memories:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My father and I first took the boat and then joined his companions. Continue to take the boat, after a big and big storm, the rest of the people landed on the land and followed the direction of the main eye, and they have been here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the direction of the Lord's gaze? "The Demon Hunter" Colin and Dairik and others looked at the statue on the altar at the same time, and distinguished him where he was watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Colin determined the general information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They follow the direction of the gaze of the gods and come here, that is, as long as the process is reversed, we can find the beach and find them. The location... The opposite direction of this line of sight is... The surrounding map that Baiyincheng gradually perfected in continuous exploration emerged in the mind of "Demon Hunter" Colin, which allowed him to initially depict the "journey" route of a strange boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no other temple in the middle, there is no corresponding statue, and it has been extended so far, that will pass the ruins of "Giant Wang Ting"! Colin's pupil hobo shrinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the god palace that once lived in the ancient god "Giant King" Olmer, not far from the Silver City! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The descendants of the silver country who have long been ruled by the giants clearly know where its ruins are located, but they are never able to complete the exploration because it is extremely dangerous Pure darkness without light is even more dangerous! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And according to Colin’s retrospective, the strange boy and the band arrived through the ruins of the “Giant Wang Ting”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did they do it? Perhaps they didn't go straight, bypassing the 'Giant Wang Ting'... Anyway, 'Giant Wang Ting' On the back there is a road to the sea, and the other end of the sea is likely to have a human kingdom... Is that the hope of Silver City?" Colin thought hard to contain it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Deric keenly found that the boy’s chest and abdomen clothing was stained dark red, and it seemed that liquid was slowly oozing out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you injured?" he asked cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack hangs his head and whispers in a whisper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some unsightly things... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, he opened his clothes and showed his bare chest and abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In there, inlaid with two eyes, a nose, a mouth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not painted, it’s not made of gems, it’s purely real eyes, real nose and real mouth, and not like a group It seems to belong to three people. Between Horan, Dairik imagined a picture: After the boy Jack ate his companion, he used his remaining eyes, nose and mouth in the chest and abdomen. Formed a weird face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face is gentle and indifferent, making Dairik inexplicably feel familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a couple of seconds, and Dairik figured out the reasons for familiarity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This face is very similar to the angel in the mural above, the silver-haired angel on the looping river! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the reason for our repeated explorations stems from Him! When Dairik’s heart moved, he blurted out a word, just like giving a spell to lift the dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack, the little boy, raised his head and looked at him, his mouth opened a little, and he reached the ear position:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am so hungry...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hungry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Derick was sluggish and saw a fierce battle.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was awake again, he sat back next to the campfire.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Redemption Rose" is not a mantra ... he thoroughly reviewed it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh exploration started very soon, and Dairik, who has tried it, no longer has an abnormal behavior, but only actively fights for it. I went to check the "redemption rose" mural.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way, the exploration team entered the underground hall with the altar and the idol, and found a strangely small Boy Jack.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a similar conversation, Dairik once again saw the face that was pieced together with other people's facial features.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has He did not do any irritating actions, and lowered his voice. "The Demon Hunter" Colin Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chief Lord, his face on his chest It is very similar to the angel in the mural above. It is an angel with silver hair and a river that meets the end of the river. Well, the corner is the mural of 'Redemption Rose'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Demon Hunter" Colin first stunned and immediately frowned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he watched, he calmed the little boy Jack and looked at Dairik with his eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a few seconds, he whispered: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you mentioned this thing, I made some associations. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't wait for Dairik to ask, he is self-satisfied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I studied the mural for a long time, but simply thought that it depicts a leading angel and a group of pilgrims, whose name may be called 'redemption'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The river that meets the end and the end represents the cycle, and our interpretation is that the pilgrimage trip occurs repeatedly.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And now it seems that it may identify the identity of that angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the idea you made me, because Amon was once hidden in your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Why?" Dairik was in awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Demon Hunter" Colin looks at the little boy Jack Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amon legacy The bug has the symbol of time, and the circulating river is often associated with fate. Together, I have recalled a small amount of content that was mentioned in the classics, and I don’t know the truth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Lord who created everything, the omnipotent God’s eyes watching the world, surrounded by many angels, among them, the heads of all angels, the king of angels closest to the throne, There are a total of eight, and some of their names have disappeared into the long history, and some have certain records, or simple, or detailed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rumored king of the eight angels even has the son of a god.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The titles of the two kings of angels are 'Time Angel' and 'Destiny Angel'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick said in a sigh of relief, asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think Amon is 'Time Angel', on the mural is the 'Destiny Angel'? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "I can't be sure for a while, 'When Angel' has only one title passed down, and the record of 'Destiny Angel' is relatively detailed..." "Hunter" Lin suddenly took a breath.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
