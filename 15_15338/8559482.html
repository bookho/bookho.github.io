			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Anderson’s question, Klein didn’t know how to answer it at the moment, and he couldn’t tell the other person that he fell out of the dream that was suspected to belong to the “mysterious queen”. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He indifferently looked at the unlucky "strongest hunter", raised his right hand and pointed to the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way..." Anderson Hood has a clear understanding of the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, what did you think of... I don’t know what I mean by myself... Klein moved his mouth invisibly and opened the subject. Memories said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just met a person..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not known Isn't it a member of the 'Future'? The one who had previously opened the door from the depths of this hall?” Anderson suddenly excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy, there is no shelf of "the strongest hunter" at all, just like the hot reporter of the newspaper... Klein’s belly is not answered, directly Said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She told me to tell you a prophecy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She...what prophecy "Anderson is a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am using the identity of Klein Moretti, then I will answer you "I’m sorry, I forgot, she only said it once..." Klein, while imagining a mischief that wouldn't happen, said with a low voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most deadly dangers are often hidden in the most common life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson listened carefully and snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sentence is simply too right! I almost drank into a fool when I was drinking. Who can think that most of the crew on the 'Future' drink is a problematic wine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is pondering For a few seconds, I was not too sure to ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, Have you forgotten any details or key words? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see you are provoking... Klein didn't pay attention to Anderson Hood, went to the door of the mural hall, and looked out at Frank and Nina outside. Etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before in the library, he first because the "mysterious queen" suddenly pointed out that he is the "black emperor" of the Grand Theft Auto, and it is inevitable to fall into the passive Then, trying to disrupt the rhythm of the other party, not following her baton, so the spirit has been highly tight, and the thoughts are all placed on how to cope with the verbal confrontation. There is no time and no chance to resume the whole process. The details that can be produced, now finally have this free.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, the most important thing that must be immediately understood is that the 'mysterious queen' is against me. The extent to which the identity of Russell’s Diary has been known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well...she thinks that I have mastered the way the words created by Russell the Great, not the text itself, although the difference between the two meanings Not too big, but it is enough to prove that the identity of me and the Great Passer is the layer she can't think of and there is no clue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Sharon is not just entering The mysterious circle, a newcomer who has just come into contact with complicated things, when she finds someone to help me falsify my identity, it is impossible to disclose the principal to the other party, and the photo I provided is the image of German Sparrow... Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, the 'mysterious queen' does not have Sherlock. Moriarty is equal to the conclusion of German Sparrow, yes, if she already Of course, as I thought before, the better way to call it is 'Black Emperor' Sherlock. Moriarty, which will triple the impact of my psychological defenses by directly calling the Grand Theft Auto 'Black Emperor '.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Standing from her perspective, how did she get scattered from those Find useful information in the clues? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She knows that the bookmark is the 'Black Emperor' card, so she steals the ghostly Grand Theft Auto 'Black Emperor' and the Kingdom Museum. The strange spirits are linked together, and then, because of the 'King of the Five Seas', the Nast Turk appeared in the waters of the Rothde Islands, and according to the extraordinary characteristics of the party law, the Grand Theft Auto 'Black Emperor' may also appear in Bayam, appearing in the archipelago .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is logical, but there are some coincidences in some places. 'Where the King of the Five Seas' Nast wants to appear where it appears, maybe he just misses a lady in the 'Red Theatre' and lets the ship cross The spirit world enters the waters of the Rothde Islands, and perhaps Byam has a high sequence of extraordinary materials that the 'Black Emperor' approach, which exudes a strong appeal to him... This simply cannot be directly associated with the Grand Theft Auto 'Black Emperor'.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the 'mysterious queen' is not incomprehensible to do such associations, maybe her clues to important things, I would rather make mistakes, not let go, huh, This is a good habit, that is, it will make you very tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And her big chance is not to lock up the German Sparrow in the beginning, but in the waters of the Rhodes Islands, in the 'generous city' Baie M, the adventure of the crazy adventurer, Greman Sparo, is quite loud. She can make a basic judgment by listening to the name and comparing the time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, it’s better to be a low-key person. Fortunately, the play is finally over. The follow-up can make the identity of German Sparrow disappear! Klein took care of the whole thing and felt that he was almost clear about the problem.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he had another idea and another guess:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the "star above the" Jia Delia when the German Spalro boarded the ship, too high-profile, lest others do not know the crazy adventurer and her There is cooperation!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, she is making some hints, then the 'mysterious queen' is coming, knowing that Greman Sparo, get I have clearly understood the trajectory of my activities at sea, so I have a judgment on comparison, saying that it is swindling me, in fact, quite sure! "Klein stepped out of the mural hall and walked out of the mural hall. The goal was to point to the "star above the black" outside the black abbey, and he was going to ask the other person for a half-awake opportunity and ask the answer directly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, he has actually relaxed a lot, because the "mysterious queen" obviously only knows that Gilman Sparo is equal to the Grand Theft Auto "Emperor" is equal to the extraordinary person who serves a big man, and Does not involve more secret matters.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if she sneaked the 'Black Emperor' card that night, the big detective Sherlock. Moriarty was also associated with Together, the problem is not too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From a long time ago, I was equating Sherlock Moriatti with the 'world', and the same as the "fool" Mann Sparo belongs to the extension of this layer of identity, huh, this is the preparation for a similar situation, I always feel that I can not be a fool, a person as long as there are activities, there are trajectories, interpersonal contacts, always exposed What is it, so I prepared this layer of identity for these smart people in advance, and the daily life is strictly following the corresponding settings.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the leader of the big man can Preliminary understanding of Russell's diary is a completely understandable and acceptable thing, a normal gift of a particular existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I don't think of it, the mask is still under the mask!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts are mixed, gram Ryan also felt that the help of the fog and his own prudence played a role. If it was not early to detect someone's attention, and instinctively obeyed the will of the heart, he might summon the messenger under the watchful eyes of the "mysterious queen." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger itself will not reveal anything, fearing that the "mysterious queen" has a way to track it, find Mr. Azke, and dig out the other side’s whereabouts in recent years. Ryan Moretti's identity... Klein walked through the square where many giant arrows were inserted, and walked out of the black monastery, and saw "the star above the car". Jade Liya still sat on his knees, staring at the stunning scenery at dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein jumped onto the boulder and came to the verdant yellow trees, squatting to the magnificent buildings on the opposite mountain, and asked as usual:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In Nassis, do you show the Star Bridge and take the road to the ship, including other purposes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Jia Delia's head is a little bit on the head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't tell you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "..." Klein didn't know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that the "stars above the world" in the dream world would be very honest. I did not expect this situation. Of course, this is also an honest, but honest. Is the character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
