			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Anderson’s question, Klein didn’t know how to answer it at the moment, and he couldn’t tell the other person that he fell out of the dream that was suspected to belong to the “mysterious queen”. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He indifferently looked at the unlucky "strongest hunter", raised his right hand and pointed to the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way..." Anderson Hood has a clear understanding of the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, what did you think of... I don’t know what I mean by myself... Klein moved his mouth invisibly and opened the subject. Memories said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just met a person..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not known Isn't it a member of the 'Future'? The one who had previously opened the door from the depths of this hall?” Anderson suddenly excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy, there is no shelf of "the strongest hunter" at all, just like the hot reporter of the newspaper... Klein’s belly is not answered, directly Said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She told me to tell you a prophecy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She...what prophecy "Anderson is a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am using the identity of Klein Moretti, then I will answer you "I’m sorry, I forgot, she only said it once..." Klein, while imagining a mischief that wouldn't happen, said with a low voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most deadly dangers are often hidden in the most common life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson listened carefully and snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sentence is simply too right! I almost drank into a fool when I was drinking. Who can think that most of the crew on the 'Future' drink is a problematic wine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is pondering For a few seconds, I was not too sure to ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, Have you forgotten any details or key words? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see you are provoking... Klein didn't pay attention to Anderson Hood, went to the door of the mural hall, and looked out at Frank and Nina outside. Etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before in the library, he first because the "mysterious queen" suddenly pointed out that he is the "black emperor" of the Grand Theft Auto, and it is inevitable to fall into the passive Then, trying to disrupt the rhythm of the other party, not following her baton, so the spirit has been highly tight, and the thoughts are all placed on how to cope with the verbal confrontation. There is no time and no chance to resume the whole process. The details that can be produced, now finally have this free.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, the most important thing that must be immediately understood is that the 'mysterious queen' is against me. The extent to which the identity of Russell’s Diary has been known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well...she thinks that I have mastered the way the words created by Russell the Great, not the text itself, although the difference between the two meanings Not too big, but it is enough to prove that the identity of me and the Great Passer is the layer she can't think of and there is no clue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Sharon is not just entering The mysterious circle, a newcomer who has just come into contact with complicated things, when she finds someone to help me falsify my identity, it is impossible to disclose the principal to the other party, and the photo I provided is the image of German Sparrow... Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, the 'mysterious queen' does not have Sherlock. Moriarty is equal to the conclusion of German Sparrow, yes, if she already Of course, as I thought before, the better way to call it is 'Black Emperor' Sherlock. Moriarty, which will triple the impact of my psychological defenses by directly calling the Grand Theft Auto 'Black Emperor '.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Standing from her perspective, how did she get scattered from those Find useful information in the clues? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She knows that the bookmark is the 'Black Emperor' card, so she steals the ghostly Grand Theft Auto 'Black Emperor' and the Kingdom Museum. The strange spirits are linked together, and then, because of the 'King of the Five Seas', the Nast Turk appeared in the waters of the Rothde Islands, and according to the extraordinary characteristics of the party law, the Grand Theft Auto 'Black Emperor' may also appear in Bayam, appearing in the archipelago .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After investigation, she discovered the familiar identity of German Sparrow and made a guess from the trajectory of his activity with Grand Theft Auto "Black Emperor" and chased it all the way, sneaked into the 'Future' and observed me closely. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is logical, but there are some coincidences in some places, 'Where the King of the Five Seas' is where Nant wants to appear, maybe he Just remembering a lady in the 'Red Theatre', let the ship cross the spiritual world into the waters of the Rothde Islands. Perhaps Baiyam happens to have the high sequence of extraordinary materials of the 'Black Emperor' route, which gives him a strong appeal... ...this simply cannot be directly associated with the Grand Theft Auto 'Black Emperor'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the 'mysterious queen' is not incomprehensible to do such associations, maybe her clues to important things, would rather be mistaken, not let go Oh, this is a good habit, that is, it will make you very tired.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And her big probability is not to lock up the German Sparrow from the beginning. But in the waters of the Rhodes Islands, in the 'generous city' Baiyam, the reputation of the crazy adventurer, German Sparrow, is quite loud. She can hear the name and compare the time to make the basics. Judged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, it’s better to be a low-key point. Fortunately, the play is finally over, and the follow-up can make the identity of German Sparrow disappear! Klein took the whole thing over and felt that he was almost clear about the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he has another idea and another guess:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s the star When Jia Delia was on board the ship, Mr. Sparo was too high-profile, lest others would not know that the crazy adventurer had cooperation with her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, she is making some hints, then the 'mysterious queen' is coming, knowing Gelman Sparrow, figuring out that I am The trajectory of the sea, so there is a comparison to judge, saying that it is a swindle, in fact, quite determined!" Klein single-handedly inserted, walked out of the mural hall, the target pointed to the "star above the black abbey" Jia Delia, I am going to ask the other person for a half-dream, and ask the answer directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, he has actually relaxed a lot, because the "mysterious queen" obviously only knows that Gelman Sparrow is equal to the Grand Theft Auto "Black Emperor" An extraordinary person who is equal to a great person does not involve more secret matters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if she sneaked the 'Black Emperor' card on the night, the big detective Sherlock. Moriarty was also associated, the problem is not too big "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From a long time ago, I was equating Sherlock Moriatti with the 'world', the same as the leader of the 'fool'. Gilman Sparo belongs to the extension of this identity. Oh, this is the preparation for a similar situation. I always feel that I can't be a fool. A person has activities, trajectories, interpersonal relationships, and always. What is exposed, so this layer of identity is prepared for these smart people in advance, and daily life is strictly following the corresponding settings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And the leader of the great man can initially understand that Russell's diary is a completely understandable and acceptable thing, a normal gift of a particular existence.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I don't think of it, the mask is still under the mask! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thoughts, Klein also felt that the help of the fog and his own prudence played a role, if not in advance to see someone watching, and instinct to comply With the will of the heart, he may summon the messenger under the watchful eyes of the "mysterious queen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger itself will not reveal anything, fearing that the "mysterious queen" has Ways to track it, find Mr. Azick, and dig out the identity of my Klein Moretti from the other side's recent years... Klein crossed the square where many giant arrows were inserted, walked out of the black monastery and saw "Star Admiral Jiadiya is still sitting on his knees, staring at the beautiful scenery at dusk.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein jumps on the boulders and comes to the yellow trees, To the magnificent architectural complex of the opposite mountain, the edge seems to be: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Nasse, you show the Star Bridge, take the road to the ship, including For other purposes? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a little bit on the head of Jia Delia:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't tell you! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Klein didn't know what to do for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought it was a dream The "stars above the world" in the world will be very honest. I did not expect this situation. Of course, this is also an honesty, but honesty is personality.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
