			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, the "Brave" bar, billiard room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wears a simple black jacket with a style here, wearing a dark cap, holding a cup of Nanwell beer, and closing the door and walking To the side of the back, I tried to hit the Casper opposite the ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squeezed his smile and said hello, Casper had stopped moving, straightened his body and glanced at him:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maric is not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no extra kind of party you want."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to weapons, I have nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The routine is very familiar... Fortunately, my purpose today is different... ...Klein twitched his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just came to buy weapons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary Odd and not... It seems that this stronghold was exposed, and the enemy stared at it and simply transferred the place... Then I couldn’t contact the bodyguard lady... and I’m going to use it to fool Miller Carter’s helper. Maric's living body... is secret and obedient and not afraid of death. Well, the premise of obedience is that the spirit shields the influence of the Azick copper whistle... While speaking, Klein has flashed a series of thoughts in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspars was a little surprised, suspiciously relying on the club and licking his own rosacea:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What weapons do you want to buy? The previous bullets are finished? Practice is very frequent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I practiced using The extra bullets bought by the Cragg Club... Klein smiled and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to buy explosives, which are widely used in mines."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" Casper blurted out, his expression became condensed and serious. "I warn you, don't try to do damn big things! I Will not allow my customers to provoke the West Vilas field! Of course, you can not buy weapons from me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can be a black market weapon merchant, and live Up to now, to a certain extent, it is still very disciplined, at least not to sell things to that crazy guy... Klein habitually gives the evaluation of the value of the night, and at the same time Laughing: "You seem to have misunderstood something. I don't want to blow up the door of the bank vault. I don't want to make sensational news. I just help people to dismantle the building and facilitate subsequent renovation."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why didn't he find a formal construction company?" Casper did not relax his vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, that is a secret room, he doesn't want to be known to outsiders." Klein turned and asked, "Do you know a reliable blasting expert? I I am not good at this kind of thing, I am afraid that I will ruin the whole house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspars sees each other and considers keeping the house intact, in my heart The doubts suddenly dissipated a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just before he gave his discretion to answer, an illusory whistling sound suddenly sounded in the room:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Familiar feelings emerged, Klein turned his head and found that the bodyguard did not know when he was sitting in a corner chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is still wearing a black gothic court dress, wearing a small, soft cap with the same color, the face is as pale as ever, with light gold hair and exquisite looks. They reflect each other's advantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, madam." Klein bent down slightly and took a ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, Ms. Sharon." Casper made the same move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out her name is Sharon... Kline waits thoughtfully for the other person to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young bodyguard known as Sharon is looking to Casper Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Maric will not come here again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you have something to look for, leave a message in the third way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Ms. Sharon." Kaspers is obviously The old man who has seen the storm seems to have an instinctive fear of the bodyguard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, Klein interjected:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If, I mean if, I want to find Maric, how can I contact him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Find Casper." Sharon answered very succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein spread his hand, um, "What do you mean by not saying that you don't need a blasting expert?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon's blue eyes have no slight fluctuations:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are? Are you a blasting expert? Wait, you are not a special ability, probably there are extraordinary people in the sequence 5? How did he work part-time as a blasting expert... Klein stunned and didn’t know what to pick up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he chose to believe the bodyguard, deliberately said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went to visit... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't finish talking, and his eyes swept to Casper, meaning that the next topic is not suitable for this ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the essence of the body, the black market arms traders are indeed ordinary people... Klein silently added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon looked sideways at Casper Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going to prepare explosives. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Ms. Sharon." Casper glanced at Klein and limped away from the billiard room, and did not forget to close the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the bodyguard lady just watching herself not talking, Klein has the feeling of being watched by female ghosts, busy organizing the language:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard Pound from the address of the Baron, and visited him in the middle of the night..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laft After Pound's discourse was originally retelled, Klein began to show reasoning and reasoning from the result of the reverse process: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think he has lied in many places. A family of Viscounts cannot be controlled so easily by people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even a child can find an abnormality, how can the royal family and the church be unaware? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After the fall of Raft Pound, there are a lot of opportunities to get in touch with outsiders and other nobles. As long as he is a bit courageous, he can easily Solve the problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I think he must have hidden some things, and these things probably It’s related to the underground building.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“From his state, the guy who is suspected of evil spirits can’t get out of trouble for a long time, so I’m planning to get Point the explosives, destroy the entrance, and let other people have the opportunity to go in. I am afraid that they will misplace the evil spirits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Bodyguard Miss Sharon did not affirm Klein’s thoughts, but did not negate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein hesitated and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand blasting, so Prepare to draw the layout, ask the blasting expert to give the location and weight of the explosives. If, if, let you help again, how much do I have to pay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are expensive, I am still looking for a general blasting expert. After all, I am only 50 pounds for this single, and the bodyguard is 3 pounds for 3 days... Klein has already prepared the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Free." Sharon’s answer is a style that saves words and saves words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free? Clayton was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his common sense, free is the most expensive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon sat quietly there, after a few seconds to explain a few words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "After the bombardment, there is only me left in and out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what I want to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if you intend to have enough confidence, remove the evil spirits and harvest the items inside? Explosives are actually helping you to eliminate interference and possible embarrassment. After all, the extraordinary people of other sequences can't cross the boulder and the mud like the spirit... Well, except for the "apprentice" route, but they don't know the underground. Architecture... Klein has a sneak peek: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transaction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he finished, he made a quick addition:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well...you borrowed a few more men from Maric, and your mouth is tight enough. This is a show. To Miller Carter's helper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Sharon did not refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein deliberately did not mention the payment to be paid for this, showing a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just tomorrow at 10 am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have to pre-explore the surrounding terrain and not allow the blast to cause significant damage."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon gently daggers, the figure gradually fades and disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday morning, Hugh Dilcha took the public carriage again In the Eastern District, it is confirmed in stages whether or not the commission is rewarded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When waiting for a transfer, she suddenly had the urge to buy a newspaper to see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took out a penny coin and bought a copy of the Beckland Post from the newsboy next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, her eyes solidified because of a news article in the third edition:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 7:10 last night, a serious explosion occurred in the apartment at No. 1 Dalavi Street in the Eastern District. It was suspected that a gas leak had occurred. In the room on the 3rd floor of the explosion, the tenant died on the spot, not even The whole body was left. In the middle of the night, the explosion killed three people and injured 16 people..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dalavi Street 1... Apartment No. 6 on the 3rd floor... Is this not the place where Williams rented? he died? Died of an explosion caused by a gas leak? no no! Absolutely not the case! He doesn't use gas at all, even if there is installation! He just accepted my commission, is it because of this? However, Llanus himself is a wanted criminal. He finds someone looking for him. Another place is that there is no need to kill people to keep secrets. This is easy to expose problems...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This thing is too strange and too radical, like a madman...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a fraudster...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Williams...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, I will avenge you! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will find out the truth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh and gazed at the public carriage parked in front of you, did not go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that going to the Eastern District is very dangerous now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She intends to go back and tell Fols immediately, let her temporarily move to the spare rental house, and she will dress up, sneak into the Eastern District, find an acquaintance to ask, preliminary Find out the truth of the matter and grasp the traces left by the murderer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哎, Miss Audrey’s commission is really not dangerous... It’s a fraudster that I think has been wanted, as long as I don’t block him, don’t let him Escape, he will not fight evilly... It’s my negligence, it’s that I killed Williams... Well, I don’t rule out that he is still collecting information about other things, which is the possibility of disaster... Closed his eyes and crossed the road to the opposite waiting point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
