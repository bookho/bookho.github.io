			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The innumerable glimmers came on the scene, and millions of people simultaneously uttered slang into the ears, but Klein didn’t care about them at all. The ability to tell him that his spirit is being swollen and spread from the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shadow is a huge cross, it seems to be hanging a person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible thinking storms all turned around and became consistent, and Hood Eugen’s “spiritual world” collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein found himself flying out of the top speed of the test that day, his spirit after a brief blend of some of the mysterious space above the fog, With a certain, obvious enhancement! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the shadow of the cross was about to completely cover him, he rushed out of the awkward "world" and sensed his own body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family rushed down, Klein’s eyes showed a long, thin, yellow-haired Hood Eugen, showing three candles burning quietly on the window sill . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was out of psychic state in time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, he saw a black scale on the face of Hood Eugen’s face, and the pupil of the cock was erected and became abnormal. Cold and ruthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops! He is going to get out of control! Klein's pupils were shrinking. Before they could react, they found a figure wearing a black windbreaker with a knee-length coat and a silk hat. They reached the front of Hood Eugen and lifted the special revolver in their hands. Lived in the other's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰砰砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn Smith has even shot five shots, and Hood Eugen’s head expands like a watermelon falling from the ground to the ground, red White rainstorms spilled over every corner of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed the opponent before Hood Eugen completely lost control! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly within 50 centimeters, Klein’s face was full of blood and stains. He looked at Dunn Smith, only to know that the captain’s moment was So handsome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as you don’t talk about memory, the captain is still very trustworthy... He sincerely praised him in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Dunn put away the revolver and watched Hood Eugen's almost headless body slowly fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had just to answer the language and saw that the body had turned into a pool of bloody mud and a madhouse suit in a few breaths. It seems that even the most basic structure has been destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hood. Eugen’s body soon left only a few complete things, one is dozens of scales shimmering with black shimmer, and the other is he dyed It has a light blue, crystal heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart is flowing in a dreamlike color, like a diamond that receives the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sometimes quiet, sometimes mad, sometimes tight, sometimes confusing, but there is no special performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This should be an item that can be controlled." Dunn took the revolver, took out the black gloves, put it on the right palm, then squatted and picked it up. The crystal heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items that can be controlled... According to the captain’s previous statement, this can be used as the main material for the sequence 7 “psychologist” formula...but this will not So that the extraordinary people who are promoted are more likely to get out of control? Klein took out his handkerchief, wiped the blood stains on his face and body, and retrieved the special tarot cards to clean their surfaces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked to the ground, curiously asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are these black scales? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s like a super-species that can be used as a part of the main material of a potion?” Klein asked for an example. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den straightens his body and slams his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a monster when it’s out of control... Kline sighed and slammed the room still sealed by the spiritual wall, and quickly told the previous encounter:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I was communicating with Hood Eugen, I saw a shadow similar to the real creator from his mental level, but unlike the mainstream, it was not the chain. The bundled, hanging giants are not the eyes behind the shadows, but the same as the captain you saw in the Henas. Vincent dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Hinnes. Vincent is a member of the Aurora, because Selena peeked at his mantra and carried out a complete "magic divination", which led him to investigate the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Dunn Smith saw in his dream a picture that was close to the real Creator but different from the other party’s widely circulated image, and the result was an injury. A weird death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what happened before, when Hood Eugen flipped out the "downside down" tarot card, Klein actually expected But I didn't expect it to be presented in that way. Of course, this is an indirect contact. It is impossible to compare it with his direct "peek" and "eternal yang." The worst ending is that he is injured or slightly polluted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Klein’s description, Dunn’s expression became dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned slightly and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The huge cross, the black iron Nail, naked man with blood stains hanging upside down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't see it too clearly, this is why I was not hurt, I only noticed A huge cross and a silhouette that was suspected of being hanged," Klein replied euphemistically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was only looking at "running the road"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun as if thinking The next line: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Larrous's visit to Hood Eugen is related to the 'real creator'? Is it related to the Aurora?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was busy describing the dialogue and the original picture of the psychic, and the last words: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... ...Lalhous used to seduce Hood Eugen's 'playing the law', which is a so-called immortal divinity, but I can't understand why he said that this is the worst era and the best era. Perhaps, this is the unique style of the 'scammer'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The help provided by Hood Eugen involves a gloomy, dark altar ... I suspect that Lanerus is planning something terrible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his words, he moved:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, you Remember the letter written to Mr. Z? The letter from the member of the Aurora meeting I shot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said in the letter, wait until the time Appropriate, it seems that what is the day of destruction, he will dedicate all the lambs of the city of Tingen to the so-called Lord. Will this be related to what Lalhous planned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Can Lalhus be Mr. Z of the Aurora?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean Smith thought carefully:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think so, Lalhous will not be Mr. Z, otherwise he will not set up a fake steel company to defraud others when doing the business of the Aurora. The money, this will make his main task full of variables, ah, the steel company's operation is a little unexpected, it will expose him to the police and our eyes, have to flee from Tingen, interrupt the plan."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, if he is a complete madman, it is normal to make any illogical things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
