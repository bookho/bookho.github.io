			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 pm, East Byron Dock, Dock Workers Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is wearing a thick sweater, a brown jacket and a simple soft hat, so that his image is closer to the usual investigative reporters, rather than Participate in banquets and interviews with the identity of the status object - such a costume costs him an extra 10 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he wore gold-rimmed glasses, his hair was neatly combed, and the gloss of the ointment shimmered. There was no messy beard on his face, only a week around his lips. The black and black slag, the height is at least five centimeters more than the original, and strives to be significantly different from the image of the workers last night, so that people who are not particularly familiar can not produce associations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the pockets of his clothes and trousers, there is no "black eye", without all kinds of spells and herbal oils, only a tarot card, A stack of notes, a watering pen, a wallet, a change, a bunch of keys, and a fake press card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——He doesn’t know the current state of Llanus, and he doesn’t know where the powerful people around him are from, so be cautious, no Bring any items that cause suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the two-story building in front, Klein crossed the street and pretended not to rely on the "clown" intuition to find that there were several eyes on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed the door open and found that the layout of the dock union was rather rudimentary, there was no lady in charge of reception, there was no spacious hall, and the staircase leading to the second floor was in the center. On both sides are corridors with offices, and no planks on the ground, let alone blankets, just purely cemented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked sideways at the man at the door and leaned over:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a reporter for the Becklander Daily. I want to interview the staff of your association to understand your aspirations and desires."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is wearing Less patchy, some corners even reveal a dirty cotton jacket, only a linen shirt inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the word of the reporter, he suddenly became alert and answered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No! We haven't organized a strike recently, no!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think you misunderstood, I am sympathetic to you, I am going to make a special report, describe Believe me about the things that the unions are doing to help the workers and the practical difficulties they encounter.” Klein used the extraordinary ability of the “clown” to make his eyes look very sincere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way... you go to Mr. Rand, he is the committee member we are responsible for, right turn, second office on the right hand side." The man hesitated A few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Klein pretended to take a sigh of relief and felt his gaze disappearing in the dark corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned slightly to the right with a little sweat on his back and rang the door of the corresponding office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the door is open, a middle-aged man with sparse hair looks at him questioningly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Excuse me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it Mr. Rand? I am a reporter from the Beckland Daily, Statham, this is my reporter. I want to make a report on the theme of the trade union to help you get more attention.” Klein almost always believes that he is a reporter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Rand." The middle-aged man glanced at the press card and apparently did not hesitate to say, "I can hardly believe that your reporter is To help us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was born in the Eastern District, I know how miserable the life of the workers is. If you don't believe my intentions, you can always follow. I, supervise every problem I have.” Klein added with a smile. “I have reports on actual interviews. There is nothing better than nothing. It’s better to write the news by imagination. At least you can explain your point of view. Guide things to the desired side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land touched his scalp and hesitated to answer:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will follow you all the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Thank you!" Klein almost failed to control his emotions. After he was led by Rand, he entered one office after another and interviewed the workers' associations according to the pre-set questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right side of the corridor, no harvest, the left side of the corridor, no gain... Klein's expression on the wooden ladder as usual, came to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Rand took him into the office facing the stairs and introduced the people inside:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a reporter for the Becklander Daily, Mr. Statham."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He wants to do some interviews with you, but I must remind you in advance that you have the right to refuse to answer some questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has a smile, going up two steps, making a decision with this office staff One by one gesture of shaking hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw a slightly familiar figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the other's skin turned into bronze, the ordinary ordinary round face became sharp and angular, and the glasses were changed from round frames to gold-rimmed long boxes, but Klein Still relying on the spiritual intuition of the "Divination", I found a strange familiarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his body trembled and his face almost lost control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I am sorry, I suddenly, suddenly my stomach hurts, may I ask, where is the bathroom?" Klein grabbed it with a pen and a note. The abdomen, smirked and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land and the staff in the office have no doubts and have pointed out the door:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Go out, turn left, go to the end, you can see the logo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein lost his smile, went out of the door, and quickly went straight to the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering, he picked the most toilet seat on the window, sat on the toilet and locked the wooden door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bent down his back, his mouth opened, and he laughed silently, laughing as if he could not stand straight, laughing with a drop of crystal liquid falling to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has confirmed that it is Lalhous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not based on that little familiarity, but that he perceives another scent in the other person, which impresses him to the extreme! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the main reason why he almost lost control on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tremor of his body comes from instinctive fear and fear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breakdown of his emotions comes from the horror and sadness in the depths of memory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the breath of the "real creator"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein washed his face, nothing happened Continuing the interview, even if he faced Llanus, who did not know why he changed, he also asked questions and recorded the answers step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do all this, he left the docker's association and walked out of the dimly lit house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside clouds are stacked and the mist is filled, just like entering the evening in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breath of the "real creator" can only come from Himself, His Son, and the things that extend on this foundation, such as the things He has given, For example, his divinity... This is in line with the words that Llanus had said to Hood Eugen, and with that inexplicable familiarity, I don’t have to go to the divination on the fog, I can confirm that it is him. ...if I have not dealt with the "real creator" several times, and often contact his spiritual pollution, I can't recognize the breath that does not contain strength and personality belongs to him... Klein is very dignified, but The appearance is very relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
