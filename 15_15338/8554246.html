			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland Bridge Area, Brave Bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pressed the cap on his head and carefully protected the wallet in the inner pocket of the gray-blue worker's jacket, bypassing the alcoholic around the boxing ring. Let's go straight to the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, he looked around and found no black market weapon businessman Casper Kanlin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either playing cards or playing billiards... Klein himself nodded and sat down at the bar, talking to the bartender:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Half and a half."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time he saw someone drinking this alcoholic beverage, he felt that he should fit his taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least it is better than pure malt beer... Klein is not thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender looked up at him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which two wines to use? Different choices Different prices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General, general on the line." The last time Klein saw the most inferior type, the whole cup "half Half" is only two and one-half pennies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four and a half pennies." The bartender saw Klein put the brass-colored coins on the bar before returning to the bartender. One sentence, "I am coming to Casper again? He is not here, his business has been robbed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Klein did not expect Will get such an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender hasn’t had time to answer, and the man with a mouth next to him laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, Casper was driven away by us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, why can he do this business with a lame old man?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want, even if you come to us, look for our boss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gang Fire and event? Klein’s subconscious mind came up with such an idea and he would reject the other’s proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, he thought of another possibility:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will not be the rose school Deliberately looking for a gang to suppress Casper, thus forcing Maric and Miss Sharon behind him, let them take the initiative to jump into the trap?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this probability Not low, Casper has been here for a long time as a black market weapon trader. It is definitely not someone else who can drive away. Some time ago, because of the continuous occurrence of serial killings, the atmosphere of the entire Beckland is quite tight. The Rose School, or other hidden forces, in short, are those who are looking for Maric and Miss Sharon, certainly not daring to kill and psychic, get the answer - this will create a lot of bloody cases, because they obviously only have some doubts, temporarily Unable to confirm who had contacted Miss Sharon and Maric... Kline spoke to her lips and swallowed back and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know the price, then decide whether to buy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;He intends to observe the ordinary people who have seized the black market transactions of the brave bar. If you find any problems, you can sell them Caspers, Sharon and Maric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Klein didn’t want to have a conflict, just prepared to go through the normal process of reviewing, and there was no risky problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the only requirement is." The man raised his hand and made a zipper in front of the protruding mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem." After answering Klein, Klein saw that "half and a half" was placed in front of him, and the copper penny was taken away by the bartender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a few mouthfuls in the spirit of not wasting, and his brows gradually gathered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the taste I imagined, the alcohol is too heavy, the grape is too light... Klein put down the glass and followed the man before going to Casper The third billiard room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was about to arrive at the door, he suddenly thought of one thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a person who knows little about information, I can go to this trap. Guess, don't know how long Miss Sharon and Maric are being pursued for a long time? They will definitely not come out..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, Casper There are more than one extraordinary person who knows. He has connections with several extraordinary people and may find another helper. That is a bit complicated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the man whose mouth was protruding stopped at the door of the billiard room, and Klein, who was walking, almost hit him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the inside:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't talk nonsense, our boss's temper Not very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The entire Bakerland Bridge area is known to the Eastern District"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ok," Klein sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man with the mouth protruding satisfactorily turned and pushed the door of the billiard room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the back of the door open, Klein saw a figure hanging in the air and shaking gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a big man with a beard and a beard. He has a rope around his neck and a very tight rope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His feet left the ground, the tip of his tongue was exposed, his face was blue and his expression was distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss..." The man with his mouth screamed in disbelief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland’s nervous atmosphere just disappeared, and some people started it... Kline looked at the other’s hand and looked at it in the chest. Triangle Emblem:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May God let him rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope his temper can Therefore, he was cured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man with his mouth did not listen to what he was saying, and suddenly shouted:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Killing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The boss died "!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was shaken back two steps by this loud and screaming voice, and by the way, the vision was opened and the inside was observed. Nothing happened. Traces, only the table tennis on the table is messy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the extraordinary people at Caspars do it? What will the reaction of the traps do? If there is such a trap, Klein quietly changed his position and mixed into the crowd before several gangsters surged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the kitchen of the brave bar, and thoughtfully passed to the back door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just pushing away the heavy wooden door, Klein felt the cold wind that shook his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this cold wind is mixed with a touch of bloody taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listened attentively, did not find any movement, so he pulled out a penny of denomination coins and bounced up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the cockroach was blocked by the wind, and Klein looked down at the copper penny that fell on his palm, confirming that the king’s head was facing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting the coin, he carefully walked and walked in the direction of inspiration to tell him slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been walking to the dark and dark, no corners of the street lights, the bloody taste is suddenly strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the faint moonlight that penetrated the clouds, Klein stared at him and almost took a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are messy bloody thighs, calves, feet in leather boots, ribs and roots, arms, eyes, etc. "The parts", the wall is hung with a red-skinned intestine, the background color is a large piece of bright red, mixed with a little milky white traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Klein is like seeing a slaughterhouse, a slaughterhouse for humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is afraid of the night, the punishers are too busy, so exaggerated, the police department must be the first time to hand over the case ..." Ryan groaned in his heart to counter the discomfort caused by the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bypassed the bloody place, approached the opposite wall, and found that there were many deep scratches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the traces of thick and sharp claws! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the claws of the previous demon dog are quite like, is there another one? Is it still not dead? No, no, no, I know what is going on... Klein suddenly stunned: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deceased should be the extraordinary person who killed the gangster in the bar, he The forces that were placed in the trap solved...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the description of the little "Sun", I have always suspected that the force is "Rose School" because they hold the "Prisoner" "Pathway, that is, the "heterogeneous" approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one of the "heterogeneous" is the werewolf! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is consistent with the traces of the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also proves that Miss Sharon and Maric are the deceased of the "Rose School"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Klein calmly retreats and stepped out of the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, he confirmed that there are no extraordinary features on the scene, and of course, it may not have been precipitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he turned to another street, intending to find someone to report a police, lest such a scene scare the ordinary people, let them suspect that Beckland sneaked into What a fierce beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Based on the psychology of not being greedy and involved in trouble, Klein did not wait for the extraordinary characteristics of possible existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the exit of the alley, he suddenly saw a brown carriage slowly coming in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This carriage did not go straight in the past, like the other kind, but stopped and stopped in front of Klein! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein squinted his eyes and prepared for the battle, but whether it was the spiritual intuition of the "divination" or the premonition of the "clown", There is no warning of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the carriage's window was opened, revealing a pale face with a little madness, and the brown eyes seemed to be hidden deep. Malicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric... Klein recognized each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Maric, the companion of Miss Sharon who manipulates the living corpse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only wearing a white shirt and black vest, it seems that Maric, who is not afraid of cold, pointed to the carriage and signaled Klein to go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was hesitant for a moment and wanted to take off the spirit and make a divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Maric’s figure emerged behind him, wearing a complex black court dress and wearing a small, soft cap of the same color. Miss Sharon with blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she wants to be bad for me, she can do it easily, she can drill directly from the wall behind me... Klein thought about it, pretending to be free and easy The first two steps, open the compartment door and go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he is seated, the carriage is driving slowly, not knowing where the destination is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you coming over?" Sharon asked succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein replied calmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to contact you and ask if there is any mystery Learning books, it is best to go deeper, you know, I am very lack of similar knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric used that pair is always malicious The eyes looked over and said a little hoarse and low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
