			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein held the revolver from the Craig Club in one hand and pulled the trigger continuously to hit the target accurately. The worst is also above the Eight Rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a lot of bullet feeding, coupled with becoming a "clown" and having control over the body beyond the ordinary, his shooting method is quite good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue to practice for a few months, I can be called a sharpshooter... Klein satisfactorily opened the wheel, shakes the shell, and slams The floor of the floor looked at Tallim Dumont and smiled and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you satisfied?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good." Equestrian teacher Tallim has taken off his black jacket and light gray sweater and put on a boxing stance. "Come on, let me know your fighting level. I can tell you frankly that I have been trained as a trainee knight since I was a child, and I have never been ruined since then."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an extraordinary person, if only one has received training Ordinary men can't beat, then, then I won't be a man! Klein spit out, didn't take off the double-breasted long dress, put the revolver, and took two steps on the side, making a gesture that Talim could start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to hook his finger and render the atmosphere, but when he thought about the strength of the other side, he was too lazy to waste his spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talim was quite excited about this. He jumped a few times in the field and hurried forward, playing a punch on the right side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein left his hand in one block and grabbed it, and he turned short and turned to the right palm, and smoothly came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu Tong, Tallim flew out, his back on the ground - Klein didn't force at all, just smashed the other body out of inertia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great!" Tallim quickly stood up and put his thumb down. "It’s a famous big detective, your gunwork and fighting are excellent." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just defeated you as a weak chicken. Where do you see that I have a high level of fighting? Klein whispered, and asked with a smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you understand, can you tell me what your friends want to do?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, he will go to the club and talk to yourself." Talim slammed his back on his back. "What is the commission, I don't know, right, He is a journalist, and Mike Joseph, a journalist for the Daily Observer, probably wants short-term protection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein does not Ask again, continue to practice the gun, but not only the revolver, but also the shotgun, the single-shot rifle, and the rifle, in order to meet the situation in the future, there are guns around you can quickly get started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was close to 12 o'clock, he went back to the first floor, entered the cafeteria, took a roast chicken and a fried beef chops, and the club limited today Serve cream cheese lobster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these things in place, Klein took Fenerbert's paella, fruit salad, oyster broth and Marquis black tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this sumptuous lunch, he couldn’t help but swallow his mouth and praised the goddess in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you eat outside, this one may have to spend 3 Sule... Klein alternately uses silver knives and forks and spoons to eat very satisfyingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he almost solved the food on the table, Tallim Dumont led a man wearing a heavy coat and a half-high hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Detective Moriarty, this is the friend I said, Mike Joseph, Mike, this is a famous big detective, Sherlock Morrie Mr. Yadi.” Talim smiled and introduced the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s nice to meet you.” Mike took off his hat and took a polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his facial features are not bad, the blue eyes are especially charming, plus two beautiful moustaches, which are quite mature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein couldn’t help but touch the thick scum around his lips, got up and asked the other person to sit down and smiled and said:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today's cream cheese lobster is not bad, you can give it a try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Mike Joseph did not quit, took the plate, circled it, and took a lot of food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is in a hurry and hasn't eaten lunch yet." Talim smiled and explained a message to his friend and put a stack of newspapers on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can see it." Klein put his knife and fork on his face, wiped his mouth with a napkin, and took a leisurely drink of black tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meal, he was very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Mike Joseph came back with two dishes of food, took a few quick meals, padded the stomach, and then looked up at Klein: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Detective Moriarty, have you heard of the recent serial killings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get rid of the internal organs?" Kline's heart moved, briefly asked. Talim next to him, and he said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Detectives are paying attention to this serial killing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike pulled out one of the newspapers and pushed it to Klein: "This is the latest report." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a look and found that it was Mike’s Daily Observer, which wrote on the front page: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"11! Another woman was killed! West Vilas is helpless!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Beckland Police Department The headquarters are on West Verraz Street on the edge of Queens, so they are nicknamed "West Vilas Field". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11? The 11th case? Klein resisted the frowning impulse and read down in confusion. He found that, just like the one he had encountered, the goal was female, wearing a gorgeous long skirt and taking the internal organs by caesarean section. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a case of obvious devotional demon traces, and the West Vilas field must have been handed over to the night servants, the punitives, or the mechanical heart squad. To divination, there is divination, to be psychic and psychic, and to have all kinds of peculiar and effective extraordinary means. How have you not solved the crime yet, and have not caught criminals? The guy has a rich "anti-detection" ability that destroys the soul of the deceased? Or, the soul of the deceased was taken away together with the viscera, which is a need for a demon ritual? Well, he can certainly interfere with divination... Also, if the extraordinary person of the "demon" approach does not have similar abilities, how dare to kill people in a row... Klein thoughtfully said to Mike Joseph: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to do a private investigation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I can't take over, no police invitation, I can't take over I have to maintain a good relationship with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called good relationship is to ask me to go to the police station to drink tea... Klein self-spoken a sentence . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real reason for his refusal is that the investigation into the serial killings is easy to encounter the official extraordinary, and perhaps there is the goddess church Baekeland The nights of the German parish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not an investigation, no, an accurate description is, not looking for a murderer's investigation, I just want to finish my report." Mike Joseph swallowed the shrimp Meat, explained one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Report?" Klein put down the white glazed porcelain cup, hands clasped, and asked leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike Joseph said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you buy the Daily Observer tomorrow or the day after tomorrow I will see my in-depth coverage of this serial killing, the most important part of which is to reveal the commonalities of the victims and remind similar people to pay attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
