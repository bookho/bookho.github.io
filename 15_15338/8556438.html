Zangweier has a 'sacred umbilical cord' on his body. The baby from the stomach of Mei Gao Osi comes from the 'real creator'. By using the 'umbilical cord', he successfully got rid of the imprisonment of the unknown. Forcibly returning to the real world, but he also completely lost the magical item, and will bear the resentment that the evil god can not be born in a short time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This makes him as strong as some of the goods in the department store season, only 55% of the original, um, this number is very accurate. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on a street in the east.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler held the ham in the paper bag and hurried back to the rented apartment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was alert Zhang Wang, afraid that those who are hungry with the eyes of a wolf will rush to take away their "New Year gifts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When still in the country, he used to I have seen the wolf, but I didn’t expect that Bakerland could understand the familiar feeling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too expensive, can only buy with people One, saw into a few copies... This is enough for my New Year holiday, every meal can have two, three, no, at least five pieces of ham, I can cut some, stew with potatoes, You don't even need to put salt..." Thinking of it, the old Kohler looked at the ham in his arms and looked at the red meat mixed with a lot of white. The throat couldn't help but squirm and swallowed.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;Walking around, he felt a lot of fog around him, and the church tower that was still clear in the distance was gradually engulfed by the mixed colors of yellowish and iron-black, even the pedestrians around him, more than ten steps. There is only a vague shadow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler has a feeling of being forgotten by the world, and he lifts his mouth and sniffs.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the fog of today so unpleasant? He sighed, speeding up the pace.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One step, two steps, three steps, old Kohler felt that his face was hot and his forehead seemed to burn. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a tight chest, a discomfort in his throat, and soon has symptoms of difficulty breathing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet? Damn, I also thought about a wonderful New Year. Now I can only send the savings to the clinic and go to the hospital... No, maybe I just have a good night's sleep, just cover my quilt and just sleep! "Old Kohler is silent, his head is getting hotter and hotter, and he is getting more and more confused.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, He, He, he heard his hard breathing, his hands A soft, paper bag filled with ham fell heavily on the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler subconsciously picked it up, but fell there.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed the bag with ham and tried to take it to his arms.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, he thinks there is a strong surge From the beginning, I blocked my throat, so I tried hard to fight and made a bellow-like sound.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, he had a clear understanding that he was about to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds him of his wife and children, and they are the same, suddenly infected with the plague, and soon died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds him of the time when he was hospitalized for illness. The patients in the same room could still laugh and chat that evening, and they were sent in the morning. Mortuary room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds him of the friends he met when he was a tramp. After a winter, they disappeared a lot and eventually stiffened in the corner of the bridge or the sheltered street. It was discovered that a small number of people died of sudden food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds him of a good worker, and the neighbors in the neighborhood will die so suddenly. Some of them have a headache and die, some don’t. Carefully fell into the molten steel just out of the furnace, some of the body bone pain, edema and death, and some even silently fell into the factory, batch after batch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds him of the words of a drunkard in the bar when he was inquiring about the news. He said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A person like us is like a straw in the ground. When the wind blows, it will fall down, even without the wind, and it may fall down."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is coming... Old Kohler has flashed this thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While holding the paper bag with ham, he reached out and explored the pocket of the old jacket, trying to take out the crumpled cigarette that he had been reluctant to smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he can't understand is why a healthy person will suddenly become infected, and such a thick fog is not experienced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he didn’t understand was that his life was just on the right track, moving in a good enough direction, and harvesting the Moriati detective’s advance payment. Remuneration, bought a long-awaited ham to welcome the New Year, is looking forward to taste its delicious, why suddenly fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler pulled out the crumpled cigarette, but his arm was no longer able to lift and hit the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used his last strength and wanted to shout out the words accumulated in his heart, but he could only let the weak words linger in his mouth and could not be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard his last words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard himself asking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in an apartment on the edge of the East End. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifu hangs up the last piece of laundry, waiting to dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked down at the sky outside, and was confused by the fog that did not know when it became rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, it is still very early, and our pulping work has been completed..." Liv's expression gradually became heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a good thing to finish the work too early. It doesn’t mean rest, it only shows under-employment and insufficient income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liv took a breath, turned and wiped his hands to the side, and looked straight into the next room, the eldest daughter of the book, Fleia:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the New Year, most of our employers left Beckland and went to other places for a holiday. We can't go on like this and have to find a new job."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said as she walked to the door:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this festival, those rich people will hold one After another banquet, their servants may not be enough. They may hire a temporary kitchen to clean the women. I am going to ask, Fleia, stay at home, take time to pick up Daisy, we need income, The thieves, robbers, and traffickers who raise the scorpion also need income to welcome the New Year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freya replied briskly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mind has drifted Go to the small table and the word book next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Li Fu just opened the door, suddenly stunned and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough and cough! She made a strong cough, her face was red, and every joint on her body was sore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freia ran over in panic and squatted down:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom, how are you? "Mom, what's wrong with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, cough, I have no problem." Liv's breathing is getting harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you are sick, sick! I will take you to the hospital right away!" Frya tried to help her mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too expensive, too, expensive, cough, go, charity hospital, charity hospital, I can wait, no, no big problem." Liv Wheezing Answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freia shed tears and his eyes were blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, she felt that her lungs had burned up, her body was soft, and Liv fell back on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Freia, what's wrong with you? Keke, are you sick?" Lifu anxiously shouted. "The money is, cough, block in the cupboard." , cough, the hole in the wall, you, fast, go to the hospital! Find a good, good doctor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freya wants to say something, But she couldn't make a sound, her eyes slanted up and saw the door next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is their bedroom, there are high and low beds belonging to them, with her favorite table and word book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her body suddenly twitched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liffe’s cough stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the public primary schools on the edge of the Eastern District, the fog is not too strong, but many students have begun to cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the value teacher is trained, he immediately orders:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick, go to church, go Next to the church!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daisy stood up in panic and followed the crowd to the church next to the school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, her heart glimpsed, with a sense of panic that lost some important things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Mom...Freia... Daisy slammed his head and tried to rush back home against the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, she was stopped, she was caught by the teachers and forced to go to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wuxi struggled and shouted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom! Frye娅!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mom! Frye!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the East, in the dock area, in the factory area, those who are old or have hidden diseases, like the trees that have been felled, fall down in the fog, and contact them at this time The people, who are infected with the plague, are dying, and the adults and children who are still physically strong have a slight discomfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their eyes, the fog of yellowish and iron-black is like the "death" of advent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last week of 1349, Beckland was foggy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
