			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have a bloodline of the Bailang...the university lecturer...is indeed Mr. Azke, not the same name...Klein relies on the information provided by the old Kohler, basic Azick who confirmed that the bounty was a suspected descendant of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The question is, who is it or which organization is looking for Mr. Azick?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The spiritual mission to resurrect the death as the ultimate goal?" I like Ins Zanweier, who is behind the scenes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not like the latter, Ins. Zangweier has a seal 0-08, which allows the target to act according to its own description, through a series of coincidences The purpose, he does not need to rely on the gang members and bounty hunters to find Mr. Azke...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, if this is the seal itself 0-08 What about the arrangement? Ings Zangweier found himself stared by Mr. Azuk, but he was not sure of winning in the battle. So with 0-08, Mr. Azick had a conflict with a certain force, hoping to use indirect means. Remove the enemy, and this time the reward is released by the power... very likely! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it is impossible to rule out the spiritual group. Mr. Azick may have had some contact with them for revenge, but the two sides appeared on things such as the resurrection of the god of death. A major disagreement eventually led to a break..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein instantly thought of two possible and corresponding reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a sip of coffee and then told the old Kohler:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You help me Inquire about who posted the rewards and the specific price, and if appropriate, maybe I will keep an eye out for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Old Kohler I don't think there is anything wrong with Klein's request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a sense, there is no essential difference between a private detective and a bounty hunter. The only difference is in the form of expression. The former even finds cats to help people. Dogs do this small thing, and like reasoning is better than using force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Program. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should go to the dock, thank you, detective Moriarty, you let me have a good life again!" Old Kohler picked up the table The shabby bonnet, sincerely thank you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, the detective not only provided himself with a rewarding job, but also taught many useful things, even if the other party no longer needs The informant, these skills are enough to make him survive in the Eastern District, especially after he is getting older and more and more unable to do heavy work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good life? In my opinion, what you currently have is the most basic life of a person... After watching the old Kohler out of the cheap cafe, Klein sat there and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time he has heard the name of a friend from other people after he came to Beckland, and it is also the first time that he can grasp Ince. The whereabouts of Zangweier! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past three months, especially after killing Lalhous, Klein’s main goal has been to digest the potion and upgrade himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he is very clear, himself and most of the high-sequence strong Ins. Zangweier has a difficult gap, revenge can not be eager, especially It was just a thought of the chilling seal 0-08, which made him even close to and investigate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scene in the Blackthorn Security Company in Tingen City has re-entered Klein’s mind, and the bright shoes are as clear as him. In front of the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After raising his head, he slowly vomited, and Klein took the scarf and hat and walked out of the cheap cafe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillston District, outside a somewhat outdated house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the home of Essinger Stanton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big detective wrote a letter to Klein a few days ago, inviting him to come and be a guest to discuss a murder case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was busy with the financing of the bicycle project, and euphemistically wrote back that he had no time to express his refusal. Who knows that Essinger Stanton did not Concerned, saying that the case has entered the dead alley, there will be no breakthrough in a short time, he is very happy to wait for the visit of Sherlock Moriatti detective, very much looking forward to a communication of wisdom and sparks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had to divinate the date of the visit, and selected the most recent one after the negotiation, which is this afternoon, and wrote back to the other party to finalize the matter. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang, Dangdang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pulled the doorbell twice and took a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, the door slammed open, and the assistant of Essinger’s detective smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, detective Moriarty, Mr. Stanton is waiting for you in the living room, do you want coffee or black tea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The assistant is thin and wears gold-rimmed glasses, which is both gentle and professional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked up at him and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black tea, add lemon slices. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." The assistant led Klein into the living room and pointed to the doorway of the living room. "Sorry, our servants are temporary." Today, they just have a rest, they can only trouble you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded slightly and walked to the living room on the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and knocked at the door, and suddenly felt a little wrong:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came to visit Stanton Mr. is a good thing a few days in advance, how can you happen to have a temporary servant rest? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein blinked and reached for a copper penny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door of the living room was opened by tapping, and a small gap was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, there seems to be a seal that has been lifted, and the strong blood smell has spread out and has penetrated Klein’s nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his sight, the easy chair in the living room fell to the ground, stained with a lot of dark red blood, a book fell next to it, cover Upward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just shook this way, Klein seemed to see the scene of the murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the book is reflected in his pupil:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Devil's Legends in the Regions<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devils...Klein is about to move, a gale in the living room suddenly, pulling the door quickly Rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw the complete picture of the interior of the living room:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charcoal in the fireplace has burned Waiting for, no more red appearance;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coffee table, sofa, chair, cabinets and other items fall down, broken pieces, seems to witness a fierce Fight;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of blood on the carpet and the wall, accompanied by a lot of scorch marks, but there is no body on the scene, even the residual limbs are invisible. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stanton detective has an accident? Klein took a step back and planned to leave here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a person who doesn't know where he is hiding, chillingly, watching him mercilessly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once his response is wrong, he will immediately encounter a fatal attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it appropriate to visit Essinger Stanton? I have a problem with the interpretation of the revelation? Klein didn't dare to act rashly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is not too nervous and confused, he has experienced a lot of battles and "performances", knowing that this time is the most calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒,哒,哒, Essinger. Stanton’s assistant came over with a tray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the tray is placed with a tin teapot and two white glazed porcelain cups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant saw the scene in the living room and was in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Klein, his expression was suddenly full of fear, and he said one word:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, kill, Stanton, sir..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each time he spits out a word, the flesh on his face will fall and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the words are finished, he brushes and turns into a broken body, just like it has been, it has been this state, just just stitched up . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! Click! The tin pot and the white glazed porcelain cup landed at the same time, or rolled or splashed, and the black tea tea quickly wetted nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t move, just watched it happen because he felt he was still watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who made it all seemed to be waiting for him to act, then rushed from behind him and snapped his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long, silent and strangely stalemate, Klein saw the door of Essinger Stanton’s house opened, a group of policemen wearing black and white uniforms Rushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found the disgusting and horrible corpse on the ground, immediately pulling out their revolver and pointing to Klein at the door of the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of a black muzzle, Klein relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no word, as if the gaze of the back of the head with a gun is gone at this moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein raised his hands and smiled helplessly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before seeing my lawyer, I won't say anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland Police Department Sark board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who was copied on the water pipe, once again saw Jurgen lawyer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will accompany you for the trial." Jurgen’s expression is not unusual, it seems that Moriarty detectives should appear here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really a tragedy, this time I should consider What to eat at night, instead of chatting with the police officer who is squinting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most gratifying thing about him today is the high sequence of the Aurora and the Rose School. The attention of the person, nothing extraordinary things in his own, the only revolver in the "magic" performance, easily passed the search. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the interrogation room, waiting for the police officer to ask, he will receive a letter from Essinger Stanton, and he should come to discuss a case. The original book was told again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will go to your home to get these letters with Mr. Jurgen later, I hope they are still there." The police officer in charge of the trial turned and asked, " How did you know with Detective Essinger Stanton?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
