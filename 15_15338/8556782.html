			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Moon hangs high, Klein walks up to Donna and Denton’s sisters and squats down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crevis’s female companion, Cecil, was relieved, took the rifle on the deck, leaned down and walked in the other direction. The pig's internal organs with peppercorns are still separated by ten meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle, are you starting..." The girl with a playful freckles was suddenly nervous, but her face was full of curiosity and anticipation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein erected his left index finger and leaned in front of his mouth to signal the ban on the two younger guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he couldn’t help but thank Russell, precisely because of the efforts of the ancestors, his habitual gestures could become the Northern Continent. The body language of the passage is not misunderstood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that in the early fifth period, the gesture of "Don’t Speak" was insulted by Lun, and in some parts of the South China, it was "kiss me". Meaning... Kline’s thoughts were a little divergent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna and Denton didn’t dare to speak again, quietly squatting there, watching Clevis carefully before the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former adventurer picked up a boom and threw the silk thread of the pig's viscera out of the ship's side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bang, the bait into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crivis unscrupulously spread the remaining internal organs, holding his own weapon, stepping back step by step, hiding in the shadow opposite Cecil The two formed an angle of about 60 degrees with the ship's side of the boom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying on the three-legged stab and other weapons, he lifted the rifle and tried to feel the aim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deck was completely quiet, leaving only the roar of the steam engine and the movement of the waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is a minute and a second, Donna and Denton can't help but change to sit, back against the cabin planks, soothe the paralysis of the legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, they saw the boom on the side of the ship sinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squeaky friction sounded fast, getting closer and closer, and suddenly, a figure jumped onto the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a monster bathed in a blushing moonlight, covered with dark green scales and flowing with a panic of mucus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't have much resemblance to humans, just like a huge fish grows strong limbs, and there are obvious flaws in the gaps between hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fisherman is more than one meter tall, his eyes are round, his cheeks are long, his face looks like the legendary monster, and he sees Dana’s mouth licking his mouth. Prevent yourself from instinctively screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, she also caught the mouth of her younger brother, Denton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awareness is good... Klein smirked and carefully examined the fisherman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the "sailor" who is out of control before him, the real fisherman has no human head, just a pure monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishman looked around with a slight vigilance, then he went down and picked up the viscera of the pigs scattered on the ground, flying fast into the entrance, making obvious The chewing sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s white-based eyelids, and the fascination is gradually fading, as if it is a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IQ is not high... Klein shook his head and gave a judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crives pulled the trigger, a bullet flew out of the rifle, and instantly hit the fisherman’s chest and abdomen, playing scales broken, flesh and blood Splash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow!" The fisherman made a cry of crying, and with both hands, he rushed to the shadow of Crevis, as fast as A steam train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Cecil in another position also opened fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rifle bullet hit the fisher's side ribs, causing a lot of debris to scatter and the tall figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fisherman who ate the pepper granules appeared to be visible to the naked eye, and it stopped there, wondering which enemy should be resolved first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives Krivis and Cecil a chance to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They aim again, and the trigger is triggered before and after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two blood flowers bloomed one after another, and the pain restored the eyes of the fishermen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It smashed and fled, avoiding subsequent shots, and bullying Krivis as if it were not injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crivis laid down the rifle in his hand in an orderly manner and picked up the three-sided thorn that leaned against it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hide, a leap forward, rolled to the side of the fisherman’s side, and the triangular thorns in his hand slammed into the prey side ribs. The scales are broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fisherman suddenly swayed and brought a gust of wind, and the hard-boiled spurs the thorns together with Krivis to let the former adventurer A slammed fell on the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishman shook his head and seemed to feel the strong discomfort of the body. It didn’t attack Krivis and Cecil anymore, and strode forward. To the ship's rail, try to jump into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecil’s bullet hit it again, making a bleeding-colored flower, but still did not let it lose its ability to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two steps, the fishman ran to the right place, his knees bent and he was about to jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, its body is soft, but it has not succeeded in exerting force. The distance of jumping out is obviously insufficient, and it can only fall on the inside of the ship's side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fisher is slamming the rifle and wants to climb over the ship's side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing it escape, Klein took out his own revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a loud bang came from another direction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left eye of the fisherman turned into a bloody hole, which made people faintly see the pale gelatin inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is still not dead, kneeling in the cabin, trying to crawl and trying to stand up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, the toxic outbreak, it convulsed and died completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked around and saw a middle-aged man in the shadow of the other side leading to the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This middle-aged man is wearing a dark red thick coat, white loose trousers and a standard bonnet on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carries a piece of iron handcuffs that lags behind the times, and the thick black and deep muzzle is running white smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had previously introduced the man, knew the man, knowing that he was the captain of the White Ony, Elland Kage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan, with obvious wrinkles on the corners of his forehead and forehead, headed to Krivis, smiling slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a captain, I must ensure that no accidents have occurred.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please forgive me for watching. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crevis has long stood up, no emotions are exposed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is you Boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" By convention, you have the right to share loot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elland looked at Klein and others on the side, with a smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next time you add water and food, you have to find your own way after two days. Save the body of the fisherman.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not as good as this, sell it to me cheaper, even if the difference is the reward I should get. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the best way. Krivis and Cecil exchanged their eyes and agreed to Elland’s request. "As long as 130 pounds, it is all yours." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary material on the fisherman, the market price is between 150 and 200 pounds, considering other spiritual parts, 130 pounds is really cheap...but They can only do this in Krivis. This is the ship of Elland. There are a lot of armed sailors and crew to help him. I really want to talk about the collapse. In minutes, someone can sink the people in the place... Of course, The premise is that I don't mix... Well, I can see that Krivis and Cecil are not extraordinary, at least not the extraordinary in the field of fighting and shooting, but Elland is a bit suspicious... Klein stood up. Listening to the transaction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you seem to have misunderstood something, I am not threatening you, £150, this is a fair price. "Alan K. K. called a sailor and gave him the key to the safe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the ‘fair of Ireland’? Cecil seems to think of the other party's nickname at sea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erlan smiled a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Donna and Denton’s sisters, who were stunned by the fierce battles and living monsters, jumped up and excitedly and fearfully ran over. Close to the body of the fisherman.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It, is it really dead? "Donna kicked the body of the fisherman with her toes, and then jumped out like a fear of the resurrection of the other side, hiding behind her brother.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really It is a monster! "Denton took a breath and widened his eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At sea, there are many monsters. In fact, this should not be called a fisherman. It has four limbs. I can stand and have nowhere in the same place as human beings. I prefer to call it a fish monster. "Alan is warm and laughs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately squats down and pulls out the knife and cuts the cheek under the fisherman’s eye, revealing that it is contaminated A little red white tender meat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most delicious part of the fisherman, suitable for raw food. "Alan carefully cut the film down and handed it to Donna. "You remind me of my daughter. Unfortunately, she has grown up and has her own family." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I dare not eat..." Donna looked at the thin piece of meat that the tip of the dagger poked.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, who would you like to try? Elland smiled and looked around.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After confirming the spiritual instinct without any reminder, Klein nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very curious. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alanland handed him the dagger:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try, on land Even if you are a nobleman, you may not have a chance to eat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a fish man, this is a fish monster, which can be understood as a variant fish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He is dispelling the fear of his sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wanted to ask if there were condiments such as mustard and soy sauce, but if you didn’t mention it, it would be difficult to open it, for fear that it would be uninformed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the dagger, biting the bloody tender meat and swallowing it into his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an instant feeling of the mouth, the blood smell is very light, with just the right salty taste, perfect to bring out the delicious sweetness of the meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein chewed twice, only to feel the tenderness of the fish, only to see his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great." He cocked his thumb without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
