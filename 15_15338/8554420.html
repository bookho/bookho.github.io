			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone pillar stands in front of it, supporting the high dome, the mottled and old long table seems to have been placed here hundreds of thousands of years ago... Although Li. Hall has seen this scene many times, as long as she comes to the fog, she will still have a shocking feeling from the heart to slowly reverberate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She swept away, didn't see the new members, and immediately looked up, bowing to the convenor who was covered with thick fog:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon, 'Mr. Fool'~~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, she suddenly saw the "fool" on the right hand side The table top is covered with a complex and gorgeous playing card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is so quietly, casually, placed like a normal item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, is this "sick card"? A "sick card" that hides the path of God! Audrey instantly realized that after the "fool" dagger responded, she subconsciously aimed at "downside down", "sun" and "magician" and found that they also noticed the card that did not exist before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, their eyes and movements reveal their doubts and surprises, as well as the inevitable guesses. After all, the "fools" who can be mysteriously high above The card that Mr. is at hand is definitely not an ordinary item... Well, Mr. "World"’s reaction is a bit strange, he didn’t go there at all... Is he hiding too well? He is really the "star of the audience" and "reader"? Audrey quickly judged the "brand of the card" except for the "fool", who only knows it himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This makes her quite proud. She shared a secret with her parents when she was a child, but her two brothers didn’t know it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Russell The "sick cards" made by the Great, the treasures of the mysterious world that have been fantasized by countless extraordinary people! Audrey, after being greeted by "Magician", "Sun" and others, took the initiative to raise the hand: <br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, I have something to report to you separately. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Report separately? "Inverted" Alger slightly frowned, subconsciously guessing the content, but no clue.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik and others are equally curious, but not too concerned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gently sighs:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, he is not sure what Miss "Justice" wants to report.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait For two seconds, he masked the senses of the rest of the members and made a reminder to “justice.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey sat down in a dignified manner and said sincerely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. 'Foolies,' because I was buying a 'audience' formula at a meeting of extraordinary people, and two people who were suspected members of the psychological alchemy group recently passed some nobles. Contact me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I tend to join them, but only if they can keep themselves safe." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your opinion about this? I take this very seriously. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychological Alchemy... According to various sources, this is a less evil organization. They may not have the god of faith at present, to the mind and consciousness. , spiritual and spiritual exploration and research, and closer to the academic mutual aid society, of course, in the eyes of the orthodox church, this also belongs to the 亵渎 (they think that everyone's spirit should belong to God), in addition to Dust. Derian said that there is a certain tendency at the top of the psychological alchemy association, that is, to the original creator, the god who created everything, to some extent worship, the more primitive worship... Kline flashed a lot of thoughts and finally But just smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You feel right, you can do it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you encounter difficulties, you can ask for help at the Tarot. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it, adding a very plain and casual tone: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the psychological alchemy, there are some people who are inserted into the church, such as The informant of the punitive, the informant of the night, you must know how to hide and cover yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool" is really good, but also specifically remind me to be careful ...... Audrey slightly bent his eyes, smiled shallowly and replied: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be insiders of the Tarot Club in the future psychological alchemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......"Miss Justice", you have not joined yet, just think about how to betrayed... Klein silently painted an invisible blush for the psychological alchemy The month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reporting the psychological alchemy meeting, Audrey did not rush to end the individual exchange, and instead said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Mr. Fool', I remember two pages of Russell's diary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why she asked for a separate exchange, if Under the testimony of "Magic" Firth, there is a Russell diary, given to the "fool", she can imagine, after returning, the other party will immediately come to her to borrow the "Russell" Notes, and the goddess can prove that it was all seen by Mr. Fool! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before forgetting, I was looking for a chance to tell Fols these two days. The "Russell notes" I bought were bitten by Su Shi, um, It’s broken, it’s broken, it’s impossible to recover! Sorry, Susie... Audrey repented in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good." Klein gratefully knocked on the edge of the bronze long table to help Miss "Justice" have a diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two pages of paper arrived, his eyes cast and his smile gradually stiffened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first line of the diary is written:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"March 6th, Mommy, here The food is so fast that I am constipated!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my Rousse At the commemorative exhibition, Klein concealed his expression and turned to the second page. He found that the content is still Russell's early complaints and various novel experiences, and there is no practical value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He controls his expression and smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are hoping to pay from the unpaid What is the extra deduction for the pound?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey did not hesitate to speak directly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Mr. Fool', I want to know which "God card" contains the path of God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really money Dung... Klein sighed silently and smiled without concealing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is a 'black emperor' card."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The corresponding sequence 9 is 'lawyer'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way...Audrey got the answer I only feel that I am exceptionally satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a separate exchange to this end, "Magic" Firth can't wait to look to the bottom of the "world":<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. 'World', I will collect magical items or powerful weapons for the sun as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, What kind of transaction was privately reached?" Audrey, who was conscious of Fols and familiar with it, but did not know the matter at all, couldn’t help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folse spit out his breath:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. 'World' helped me find it' The master of the trick master's formula."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted man" Alger concealed the solemn expression, once again examined the "world" and raised his assessment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "Sun" Dairik is quite looking forward to, he hopes that after digesting the "Prayer" potion, Mr. "World" can easily find Come to the recipe for Sequence 7 "Sun God Official". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world that is unaware of a gaze is humming two channels:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Mr. Magician, before you buy, it is best to mourn the name of Mr. 'fool' and ask him to pass the corresponding message to me. Well, I have asked Mr. 'fool', he promised to help. We."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the item you are looking for is not my satisfaction, maybe I will consider changing the other requirements."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the solar field, Klein currently has three options, so he intends to compare and then finalize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, the brooch mentioned by the "eye of wisdom" is known to have the effect of purifying and exorcising, and allowing the wearer to use part of the solar field. The spell, the negative effect is that people do not feel cool, always in a state of heat and trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein feels okay with this magical item, and the price may be close to 2,000 pounds. At that time, even if he sold the "bribery" formula, he would Not coming out, so I plan to wait a few days first. If the "magician" and the woman with the "artisan" behind it fail to find a better one, he will realize the formula and buy a brooch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, I will give you information no more than tomorrow." Fols has confirmed that Mr. A will meet this evening, but still reserve more An extra day of anti-an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After their conversation, "After Hanging Man" Alger looked around and said that he had already made a good draft:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I recently took over a survey mission, I don't know if you have any corresponding clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two or three years, in the South Many indigenous tribes were looted and everyone was tied up. In the various plantations, in the archipelago at sea, the slaves also fled strangely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the abolition of the slave trade in the northern continent, such a thing has not happened for a long time, have you heard the corresponding wind?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp His eyes swept through "justice", "magician" and "world", but did not look at the "sun." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where in the Silver City, teenagers trapped in the land of God may know the outside world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey carefully recalled the words that were usually heard at aristocratic gatherings, after a while:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I haven’t even heard of similar things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Firth and "World" followed Shake his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of the black market slave trade is booming again? Where do you need a lot of slaves? Klein sat at the top of the bronze long table and thought about it in a puzzled way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See no one can provide clues, "Mr. Fool" is not interested, no interjection, "downside down" Alger's expression turned unchanged :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can try to collect the formula of 'Winners'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I will give you absolute satisfaction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind" formula? He is quickly digesting the "voyager" potion... Klein turned on the vision and swept the "hanging man", and found that the color of the surface of the other star spirits was not only purely like the blue sea. And there are a few flaws that seem to be slowly undulating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Calculated, it took nearly four months for Mr. "Inverted Man" to digest the "voyager" potion, but he is often at sea... ... Audrey also made a judgment based on the observed phenomenon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
