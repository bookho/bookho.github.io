			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the stormy sea, an old three-masted sailboat is ups and downs with the waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not fast, and it’s not big enough. In this disaster scene with the sea, it’s like leaving the dead leaves of trees, but no matter what How the hurricane is mad, how horrible the waves are, and it sails safely without seeing the slope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger Wilson stood on the empty deck and looked at the huge waves around the mountain. I don’t know what to think about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s going to be Monday again..." he whispered silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the day of the Mother Earth, the beginning of a new round of prosperity and defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for Alger, there is another meaning, which belongs to a mysterious existence that is always shrouded in gray and fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least I haven’t become a madman... He regained his gaze and laughed at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, one of his few crew members came together and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Bishop, what is the goal of our departure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger looked around with a tone of no answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunt up the 'listener' of an Aurora."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm is gone, the fog is filled, there is a gunboat but it still does not conform to the trend of the singular sailboat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A boy of eighty-nine-year-old, yellow-haired and soft-eyed, trembled at the undisciplined pirates, watching them enjoy the vat of beer and watching They swayed through the ropes and watched them taunt each other and even punched each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and looked at the black robe man standing in the shadow, pressing down the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Father, where are we going?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five days ago, he had the impression that he had seen his father for the first time and claimed to be the father of the adventurer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the oil painting left by the mother proves the identity of the other party, if the orphanage is opening the door for himself, he is absolutely unwilling to leave his hometown, follow this Nearly strange to a close relative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in the shadow lowered his head and looked at his son, replied with awkwardly and slyly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Jack, I will take you to a sacred place, the 'sanctuary' where the Creator once lived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that the kingdom of God? We A mortal can only enter if he is given a gift..." Little Jack was taught very well by his mother and had enough common sense. At this time, he was surprised and feared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man standing in the shadows has a deep and unforgettable face, which is like the stone sculpture done by the best masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put his hand to his ear, put on a listening gesture, and answered with a near-nightmare tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "Jack, 'mortal' is a wrong concept. The Creator created this world. He is everywhere. He exists in the body of every living being. Therefore, everything is divine and divine is rich. The degree can become an angel, and the seven pseudo-gods now are only more powerful angels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, I can hear the Creator now. The teachings, ah, what an extraordinary revelation! Life is just a spiritual journey. When the spirit is strong enough and tough enough, we can find our own divinity and combine with more divinity. One..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Jack couldn’t understand the complicated description, shook his head and asked another question that had not been asked before:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, I heard from my mother that after the Creator created this world, he became a multi-object, and did not ? & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp actually exist, then why are his 'sanctuary' "<br <br /> & nbsp />;As a child of seven or eight years old, his logic is clear enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man whose face was like a sculpted man squinted and his head turned aside, as if he heard more whispers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he squatted, his knees on the deck, and the bare skin highlighted one green and one black thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He covered his head with both hands, his face twisted into an abnormality, and he shouted extremely painfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are lying!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used lunch at Old Neal After ensuring that he will bring himself to the underground trading market next time, Klein will slowly return to the Black Thorns Security Company, considering reading the literature in the civilian staff office, practicing the ability, or the captain of the team, Dunn, has not yet banned, and continues to wander around to the Divination Club. Play the role of "divination." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, before he had time to make a decision, he saw Dunn Smith coming in from the outside, wearing a black trench coat and wearing a half-high hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, how is the situation?" Klein thought about the whereabouts of the Antignus family notes, and asked a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den’s gray eyes don’t look too tired:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The notes of the Tigonus family are in the hands of Riel Bieber, but he has completely disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already passed the telegram, this will Some things told the night squad, please pay close attention to the various ports, steam train stations, the first batch of printed images were also mailed out yesterday afternoon, will be published in the major newspapers."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time if there is a phone, a fax machine, a surveillance camera, there is big data just fine... Unfortunately, I only know how to use it, even the principle only knows a little bit... ... Klein breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, no matter what, we have found the whereabouts of the note, and this is your credit, of course, it needs further confirmation. I have sent a telegram to the Beckland parish and asked them to send someone to escort the seal No. 2-049, a dangerous item that once belonged to the Antigonus family. It helps us know Riel. Is Bo is a descendant of the Antigonus family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"2" seals... dangerous... cautious and temperate... Klein wanted Curiously asked what this seal is, what special ability, where the danger is, but remembered that he was not secret enough in an instant, but had no choice but to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the goddess protect us." Klein clicked on his chest and drew a full moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den opened the door of his office and nodded slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goddess has been Bless us, Klein, if you didn't choose the 'Divination' before, wait until this thing is confirmed, you should be able to become an official member, pick the 'sleeper', but unfortunately... Frankly, I never understand why you I will choose 'Divination', and 'Collector', although people resist, but you have seen Dai Li, you should understand how powerful the 'Psychic' is, and 'Peeping the Secret' is also a good choice, at least Lao Ni As an example, the risk of getting out of control will be low."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this question, Klein got the answer at the beginning, but Dunn never asked until It’s only mentioned now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He organized the following language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am thinking about, 'Divination' and 'Peeping the secret person' belongs to the auxiliary extraordinary, not always facing the enemy, it is too dangerous, and you and the old Neil also said that in the mysterious and extraordinary fields, curiosity and exploration often have terrible consequences, The voyeur description of 'The Secret Man' makes me feel worried, so... Oh, you know, I was only an ordinary college student not long ago, and timidity is the only reason I chose this way."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to say that this is an unexpected and reasonable answer." Dunn snorted and smirked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his body halfway, and looked at Klein up and down in the ashes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
