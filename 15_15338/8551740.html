			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buildings in Morse town mostly follow the style of a hundred years ago, the most conspicuous one is the steep, black church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting the carriage, Klein and others quickly solved the lunch made up of bread, toast, bacon, cream and coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Under the purification of the seal '3 - 0782', we can support two hours and thirty-five minutes." Cohenli stood at the door of the church, from In the inner pocket of the tuxedo suit, the gold-colored pocket watch was taken out. I looked at it and said, "I recommend dealing with the suspected haunted incidents first, avoiding the possible deterioration, and then returning to the church, taking turns guarding and recovering. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Under normal circumstances, Sequence 9, Sequence 8, and Sequence 7 close to the limit state are far away from the "variant Sun Emblem" for 2 hours. Complete recovery, but if you don't reach the limit, or just want to restore the part, it depends on the situation, at least 1 hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no opinion."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and Leonard speak at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which event do we deal with first?" Cohenley consulted his companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard put away the gesture of hanging out: "The old-fashioned old man heard the heavy footsteps in the house."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Cohenli subconsciously asked for reasons, and Klein was waiting for someone to explain with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the so-called poet intuition? He quietly blackened each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard’s gaze moved from the low-faced Cohenli face to Klein’s face, then moved back, chuckling:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it is closest to the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know? The information is not written... ..." Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard smiled and said: "I didn't go to the bathroom during the meal? On the way back, I met a trainee pastor and talked a few words." He told me that Noah’s home is near the church. Well, Noah is the name of the solitary self-employed.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s worth more than three years Well, the task is very skilled... Klein laughed and said to Cohenli: "Then we will go to Noah's home first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ". Cohenli has no opinion on this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just one minute later, they arrived at Noah’s home...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noah He is a white-skinned and sparse old man. He will lose his left hand forever in a war. He has to leave the army, take compensation, and return to his hometown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, he opened the door, looked at the three strangers in front of him, and looked at the hurriedly rushed from the church, hoarse voice道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in, I hope you can solve my problem. I heard that you brought holy water, holy emblem, silver enamel and garlic? This is very Well, I am relieved a lot. Please forgive me. You must understand that an elderly person can’t sleep peacefully for two consecutive nights. Hey, goddess, I have always been afraid and my spirit has become恍惚.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just entering the gate, Leonard suddenly straightened his back, his eyes just look at the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, Klein felt the coldness of the room, which was the trace of the ghosts who had been here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are indeed unclean creatures coming." Cohenli finally found the situation here, and said the voice down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very weak." Leonard regained his gaze and opened his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Klein felt that the warmth and purity of the seal "3 - 0782" naturally melted away the cold atmosphere, and the other side had no resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the townspeople who waited for a while gathered at Noah’s house and watched Klein with a pair of curious and anticipating eyes. Leonard and Coenley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough!" Leonard cleared his throat and said, "We have the blessing of the goddess, and those unclean creatures will soon disappear, not Cause any trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he used his eyes to show Klein to perform "purification ceremony" for everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it me? Klein asked with a look of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he doesn’t know if Leonard can understand his own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s clear that Leonard understood what he meant and lowered his voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s a professional, in terms of rituals.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, who asked me to apply for help? Klein sorted out the clothes and took the holy water, the holy emblem, the silver plaque and the garlic from Leonard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first put the "Dark Emblem" on his chest, then opened the garlic and threw it all over the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, is garlic used like this when you drive out ghosts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" and The description in the newspaper is different..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can this be useful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The onlookers of the townspeople talked in an instant, curious and excited, just like going to the circus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Useless! I just want to do it! Klein suddenly had the feeling of becoming a "clown". He quickly closed his eyes and picked out the holy water with a silver plaque and sprinkled it on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sprinkles while walking around the house, with words in his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Night Goddess... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Secret Mother...The Lord of the Red..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evil and Fear The Queen..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lord of sleep and silence..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This standard of the gods van immediately shocked the audience, the townspeople have quieted down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person enters a quiet state, it is easy to detect what was previously ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very warm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like sunbathing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I seem to have seen the pure sky..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's amazing...this Is it the role of holy water?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s a priest from the Church of St. Serena!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;“赞美女神!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The townspeople whispered, The eyes of Klein, Leonard and Cohenli are gradually awe, and the owner Noah is obviously relaxed, no doubt about whether things can be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the effect of the seal "3—0782"... We are going to drive away the ghosts and actually do nothing, staying in the same place for one minute is enough... Don't be very tired and troublesome... After Klein has purified the cold atmosphere of the house, open his eyes, put away the silver plaque, and draw a blushing month on the chest seriously and seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like beautiful gods!" The townspeople responded devoutly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still some things to deal with, but we need absolute silence." Leonard looked around and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The townspeople who saw what was called "professional" did not dare to stay forcibly, and under the greeting of the priests of Sier, they rushed out of Noah’s home. Even the owner of this house had to leave temporarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I really want to sleep right away..." Noah muttered to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard stepped forward and closed the door, turning to Klein Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Divination of the cause of the incident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem." Klein also wanted to try what he could do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that Mr. Azick did... but his personality does not seem to be low, oh, a person who can live for 1,340 years Certainly not too low... So my divination will inevitably be affected... In this case, I don’t have the mysterious space above the fog to help me, I don’t even know what I can get... Klein I took out the pen and paper that I carried with me and wrote the "Divination Statement":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cause of the haunted event in Noah."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the piece of paper, went to the round table, sat down, closed his eyes, and leaned back against the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blurred, awkward world, Klein suddenly saw a black mausoleum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is similar to the pyramid, but it is embedded in the ground and almost buried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this ancient mausoleum, the thick black fog covers everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein Horan wakes up and opens his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the discovery?" Cohenli asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought for a moment, without concealing the revelation gained in the dream, and finally said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is certainly not the mausoleum style of the Northern Continent. I mean the Fifth Age. In this respect, I am barely an expert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenner De ashamed to nod in thinking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the 'inverted pyramid' of the South Continent, meaning to enter the underworld from the human world, regardless of the past worship The Lang Empire, or its branch of the Highland Kingdom, and so on, only the so-called descendants of death can build such a mausoleum for themselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a sense, This is the symbol of 'death.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the ghost will definitely be related to death, and this divination result is undoubtedly correct."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without paying attention to Leonard’s ridicule, Klein’s ecstasy produced an interesting idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp; Is Mr. Azick a descendant of death, or is he able to obtain such a long life because of a certain transaction with the god of death? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the corresponding chapters of The Apocalypse of the Night and the internal data of the night-timers, the god of death is an evil god, once smashed in the northern continent at the end of the Quaternary A catastrophe, that time was called "the pale age." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ah. He later said seven fall together ...... God's La Mude initial castle has not test, but no earlier than "pale years." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; If you really some contact, that live in the red house behind the chimney removed Mr. Azi Ke child's skull, there can explore the place ...... < Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this may also be an excuse for the colonization of the southern continent of the North Continent countries, after all, the main belief in the death.........<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
