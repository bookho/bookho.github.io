			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color of the blood reflects the eyes of Klein, and his red eyes are almost solid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sound of a light cough suddenly came out of the house, and the old Neil hoared the scorpion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Dun, what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun's ashes are so deep that he answers with a mellow voice.道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you are ill, let's visit you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quiet, after a few seconds, Old Neil yelled in anger and fear: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! You are lying!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to wait for Klein and others to speak, his tone is weak:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I know my status Something is not right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil... Klein closed his eyes sharply, and the blood leaking from the crack did not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, Old Neil raised his voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But always, I I didn’t hurt anyone, and I didn’t want to hurt anyone in the past! I didn’t, I didn’t sell the important secrets of the night-timers. I’m the most, at most, I’m reimbursing the cost of not reimbursing. I really haven’t done anything bad!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein." He suddenly shouted as usual. "I told you that the esoteric esoteric is 'do whatever you want, but don't hurt', I always insist With this sentence, I would rather be patient, prefer to wait, and not do things that hurt others..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he is afraid to ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dun, Loy Yao, Klein, go back, go back, wait for tomorrow, wait for tomorrow, I will be back to normal, I swear, to The goddess swears, I will not hurt others, really!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng closed his eyes and asked very softly "What do you want to do? What have you been trying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?" Old Neil was first stunned and then screamed, "I In trying to resurrect Sally, Dunn, I have found a way, I am on the right path!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should have heard, I was at the beginning I made a mistake when holding the ritual magic, failed to cure her disease, and failed to save her. I know that this is because my occultism is not well mastered, and now I have enough knowledge and experience to go. Finishing it all! It’s a pity that I didn’t get the inspiration from the mystery of 'the glimpse of the mystery’ and the case of Dai Li, and missed the best chance. If I were a high sequencer, things would become It’s very easy.” Saying, Daniel took a few minutes of crying. “No, I can’t give up anymore... Dunn, go back, go back, I beg you.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein clenched his teeth and heard the captain’s voice whistling slightly: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you plan to resurrect Salisbury?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil becomes excited:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will prepare a body that will not age in her way of 'life refining', Dunn, maybe you don't know, the Mother Earth Church Sequence 4 is good at 'life refining', and the corresponding sequence of the 'common person' approach is barely manageable. Well, I will do it with the help of the gods. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then, I will summon her soul from the spiritual world and pray for the help of the gods to reunite the spirit and the flesh. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a great idea? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng Enqiang squats on the corner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, great idea." Old Neil, let's go in, maybe we can help you. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vague vision of Klein and Lorraine, Dunn lowered his head and immediately raised his head: "Old Neil, you misunderstood, we are coming to visit you, you are our companion, you are sick, The situation is not right, we will definitely visit you, open the door, let us take a look, let us rest assured, as long as you really have no big problems, we will go back immediately, you know, the recent tasks are particularly many, we have to monitor The madhouse, on the one hand, has to deal with various emergencies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil hesitated:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I really have no big problem, really, I will be able to recover tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red blood oozing from the gap in the main entrance along the steps It flowed to the stone road and flowed into the garden soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Neil, have we known for 15 years? The task of partnering doesn't know how many, I care about you, I am worried about you, I have to look at myself. You can rest assured if you look at it." Dunn said with a voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...that's alright." Old Neil muttered. "I really have no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the main entrance slowly opened, and Klein quickly raised his hand and wiped his eyes, so that the line of sight returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he saw the carpet in the foyer covered with bloody, viscous, long-haired liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking ahead, moving up, he found that the floor, ceiling, round table, piano and chair of the living room were all disgusting, sticky, bloody A dense, black, short-haired liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil's white head hangs in the air, connected to the ceiling through thick mucus, and a pair of eyes on the forehead and cheek, indifferent, Eyes without eyelashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keys of the piano are jumping on their own, playing a beautiful and melodious melody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dun, look, I really don't have a big problem." Old Neil said with a smile, "Luo Yao, Klein, you think so too." "Right!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his mouth, and Klein saw a thick, bloody, black short-haired liquid flowing inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun's ashes flashed a bit and seemed to chat casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Er, where did you learn from 'Life Refining' and 'Resurrection Ceremony'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil replied excitedly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard, I tried the previous part, it is true! This is the gift of the gods, He keeps telling in my ear, describing that He is, He Yes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil’s voice was stuck, and after a dozen seconds, he said with sorrow and fear:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is hiding the sage..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden sage? Isn't that the non-personalized god believed in the Morse martyrdom? And this god, who later lived, brought evil and degeneration... The Morse martyrdom mastered the complete sequence of "sneak peeks"... Kline’s heart moved and thought of a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the "hidden sage", Old Neal seems to have finally woke up, staring blankly and looking at everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unspeakable silence, his six eyes looked at Dunn at the same time, and smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It turns out that I have become a monster..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t wait for Dunn to answer, the old Neil suddenly panic, pleased, Fearful, timid smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me leave, I will go into the mountains, no longer appear, I will not hurt anyone, I am only quiet Try my ritual, really, let me go, please, please, please."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the four cold, lash-free eyes of the old Neil flashed through the dark light, firmly locked in Dunn, and his expression became indifferent:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You are pulling me into a dream!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no use! My eyes can see through it all!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody viscous liquid filled with ceilings, floors and walls began to wriggle, just like a giant opened his mouth and tried to swallow all of Klein and others. The head becomes blurred, like the superposition of heavy phantoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not panic out of the revolver, but instead directed his hand to the pocket, intending to use the "Sleep Charm." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw everything calm down again, and those bloody, sticky, dense, black, short-haired liquids were as peaceful as the windless lake. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil lost his expression of indifference, coldness, hatred, eagerness, and became quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown when, Dunn had already lost the seal "3-0611" and threw it into the bloody viscous liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the old Neil’s forehead and the four eyes without lashes on his cheeks slowly closed, seemingly lacking the desire to open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All creatures that are unprotected and exposed to "quiet hair" will become quiet and lose all power until the end of life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn, Klein, and Loyola Qiqiu shot and aimed at each other's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the old Neil’s face showed an expression of extreme fear and struggling, and the strong desire to survive actually slightly defeated the influence of the seal “3—0611”. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four extra eyes disappeared, the wrinkles in his eyes and mouth were so deep, the hair was so white, and the dark red eyes were slightly With turbidity, like what Klein saw when he first saw him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dun, do you remember that I saved you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lo Yao, do you remember that I helped you save your family's life..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein, do you remember that I teach you occult every day? Remember when we discussed how to reimburse expenses? Remember that I am grinding coffee for you? Remember how we deal with out-of-control punitives?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unreal pleading rushed into Klein’s ear, causing him to hold the left hand’s right hand and tremble clearly, making him feel like the trigger Difficult to pull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two silver hunter bullets flew out and plunged into the head of the old Neil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw the unusually familiar face with a desperate look, saw his skull smashed open, and saw blood red and milky white splashing out in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick, viscous liquid around the skin began to shrink, quietly flowing back to the head where the old Neil fell to the ground, and Dunn and Luo Yao simultaneously lowered their guns. Fall into silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein silently looked at it all, watching the old Neil’s "corpse" eventually turned into a splendid flesh and blood, and saw a pair of pains in the flesh and blood. Dark red, crystal clear eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt that it was more like a dream, and he couldn’t believe that it happened. It ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Dane two steps in a silent and silent way, seeing the captain’s slightly sloppy back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun, wearing a black trench coat, looked at the "corpse" of the old Neil in front of him and said to himself in his own voice:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
