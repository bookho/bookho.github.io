			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color of the blood reflects the eyes of Klein, and his red eyes are almost solid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sound of a light cough suddenly came out of the house, and the old Neil hoared the scorpion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Dun, what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun's ashes are so deep that he answers with a mellow voice.道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you are ill, let's visit you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quiet, after a few seconds, Old Neil yelled in anger and fear: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! You are lying!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to wait for Klein and others to speak, his tone is weak:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I know my status Something is not right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil... Klein closed his eyes sharply, and the blood leaking from the crack did not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, Old Neil raised his voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But always, I I didn’t hurt anyone, and I didn’t want to hurt anyone in the past! I didn’t, I didn’t sell the important secrets of the night-timers. I’m the most, at most, I’m reimbursing the cost of not reimbursing. I really haven’t done anything bad!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein." He suddenly shouted as usual. "I told you that the esoteric esoteric is 'do whatever you want, but don't hurt', I always insist With this sentence, I would rather be patient, prefer to wait, and not do things that hurt others..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he is afraid to ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dun, Loy Yao, Klein, go back, go back, wait for tomorrow, wait for tomorrow, I will be back to normal, I swear, to The goddess swears, I will not hurt others, really!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng closed his eyes and asked very softly "What do you want to do? What have you been trying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?" Old Neil was first stunned and then screamed, "I In trying to resurrect Sally, Dunn, I have found a way, I am on the right path!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should have heard, I was at the beginning I made a mistake when holding the ritual magic, failed to cure her disease, and failed to save her. I know that this is because my occultism is not well mastered, and now I have enough knowledge and experience to go. Finishing it all! It’s a pity that I didn’t get the inspiration from the mystery of 'the glimpse of the mystery’ and the case of Dai Li, and missed the best chance. If I were a high sequencer, things would become It’s very easy.” Saying, Daniel took a few minutes of crying. “No, I can’t give up anymore... Dunn, go back, go back, I beg you.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein clenched his teeth and heard the captain’s voice whistling slightly: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you plan to resurrect Salisbury?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil becomes excited:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will prepare a body that will not age in her way of 'life refining', Dunn, maybe you don't know, the Mother Earth Church Sequence 4 is good at 'life refining', and the corresponding sequence of the 'common person' approach is barely manageable. Well, I will do it with the help of the gods. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then, I will summon her soul from the spiritual world and pray for the help of the gods to reunite the spirit and the flesh. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a great idea? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng Enqiang squats on the corner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, great idea." Old Neil, let's go in, maybe we can help you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Dun, are you still unwilling to let me go?" Old Neil pleaded and said, "Go back, go back, I will be back to normal tomorrow, really, Dunn, I swear, I won’t steal your coffee beans again, Klein, Loy Yao, I swear, I will not let you cope with the expenses that I should not reimburse, really! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vague vision of Klein and Lorraine, Dunn lowered his head and immediately raised his head: "Old Neil, you misunderstood, we are coming to visit you, you are our companion, you are sick, The situation is not right, we will definitely visit you, open the door, let us take a look, let us rest assured, as long as you really have no big problems, we will go back immediately, you know, the recent tasks are particularly many, we have to monitor The madhouse, on the one hand, has to deal with various emergencies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil hesitated:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I really have no big problem, really, I will be able to recover tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red blood oozing from the gap in the main entrance along the steps It flowed to the stone road and flowed into the garden soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Neil, have we known for 15 years? The task of partnering doesn't know how many, I care about you, I am worried about you, I have to look at myself. You can rest assured if you look at it." Dunn said with a voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...that's alright." Old Neil muttered. "I really have no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the main entrance slowly opened, and Klein quickly raised his hand and wiped his eyes, so that the line of sight returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he saw the carpet in the foyer covered with bloody, viscous, long-haired liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking ahead, moving up, he found that the floor, ceiling, round table, piano and chair of the living room were all disgusting, sticky, bloody A dense, black, short-haired liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil's white head hangs in the air, connected to the ceiling through thick mucus, and a pair of eyes on the forehead and cheek, indifferent, Eyes without eyelashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keys of the piano are jumping on their own, playing a beautiful and melodious melody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dun, look, I really don't have a big problem." Old Neil said with a smile, "Luo Yao, Klein, you think so too." "Right!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his mouth, and Klein saw a thick, bloody, black short-haired liquid flowing inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun's ashes flashed a bit and seemed to chat casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Er, where did you learn from 'Life Refining' and 'Resurrection Ceremony'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil replied excitedly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard, I tried the previous part, it is true! This is the gift of the gods, He keeps telling in my ear, describing that He is, He Yes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil’s voice was stuck, and after a dozen seconds, he said with sorrow and fear:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is hiding the sage..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden sage? Isn't that the non-personalized god believed in the Morse martyrdom? And this god, who later lived, brought evil and degeneration... The Morse martyrdom mastered the complete sequence of "sneak peeks"... Kline’s heart moved and thought of a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the "hidden sage", Old Neal seems to have finally woke up, staring blankly and looking at everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unspeakable silence, his six eyes looked at Dunn at the same time, and smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It turns out that I have become a monster..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t wait for Dunn to answer, the old Neil suddenly panic, pleased, Fearful, timid smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me leave, I will go into the mountains, no longer appear, I will not hurt anyone, I am only quiet Try my ritual, really, let me go, please, please."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Klein only felt What illusory things are broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the old Neil’s four cold, eyelash-free eyes flashed through the dark light, firmly locking Dunn, his expression followed Become indifferent:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
