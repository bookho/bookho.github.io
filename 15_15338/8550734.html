			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Klein’s pace of complete recovery steadily entered the Blackthorn Security Company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, Klein, the weather is very cool today, I am looking forward to the evening meal." Roshan, wearing a light green dress, stands at the reception desk. At the rear, smiled and greeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein deliberately touched his stomach:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Rosanne, you should not be This time to discuss this topic, I have begun to get tired of the task that has not yet arrived, I only hope that the night will come soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me too." Luo Shan laughed Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked around and waved to indicate that Klein was close, and then lowered the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I just saw Ms. Dai Li."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Psychic' Lady Dailey?" Klein asked with a slightly strange question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This most famous psychic in Ashova County has been living in the port of Enmat, not too close to Tingen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Roshan nodded hard. "But she has already left. Ah, she is the most extraordinary person in my mind, if I can Become a psychic person, I will leave Tingen, travel alone to the world, go to Intis, go to Fossac, go to Fenetport, go to the Southland, go to the prairie, go to the virgin forest, go to the snow Plain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss, the rules and regulations of the night owls...Klein laughed and shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Even if Ms. Dai Li wants to leave the port of Enmat, she needs to apply and needs approval."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, but you can't be at this time Remind me, break my fantasies!" Roshan said savagely. "In fact, I can't be an extraordinary person. It's too dangerous. I don't know when I will die. In my opinion, The so-called extraordinary is to fight against monsters and turn yourself into a monster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chanis Said that we are the guardian, also a group of time against the dangerous and crazy wretch. "Klein sighed and answered phrase impressed him the words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to fight the abyss, we must endure the erosion of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were silent for a while, and Roshan took the lead to slow down, and her mouth slammed into the partition:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The captain asked you to come to him when he came."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein took the hat, carried the cane, and passed the partition. Knocked into the office of Dunn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged gentleman with a deep gray hairline and a high hairline put down his coffee cup and smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Dai Li has been here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not an unexpected thing, because Rosanne has told me in advance." Klein Smile responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng didn’t care about his humor and sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going to the Beckland Parish, it is the busiest and most crowded city in the world, with the most extraordinary and most opportunities... She is more likely than me to become an archbishop or a senior deacon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Klein was sitting upright and questioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng thought for a dozen seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is mastering and mining sequence potions The aspect has a unique talent... I told you before that the internal rule of the night is that if you want to take the next sequence of potions, you must wait for three years, and then undergo a rigorous examination to avoid losing control, but normally Three years is often not enough. I spent three years from 'sleeper' to 'midnight poet'. I spent nine years from 'Midnight Poet' to 'nightmare' for nine years, and from 'nightmare' to sequence 6, I It’s been three years, I don’t know how many years it will take.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“When we get old, our spirits begin to decline, even if we overcome the hidden dangers, we should not Try to promote, because the risk of losing control is so high that no one wants to take risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Dai Li and I, unlike most extraordinary people, have submitted a special application in just one year after she became a 'collector', hoping to take the follow-up potion immediately, and to everyone’s surprise, she really Successfully passed a more rigorous examination and got the 'digger's potion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From 'digger' to 'Psychic', she It only took a year, oh, this is the fifth year she has become an extraordinary person. She is only 24 years old, still young enough, and has enough opportunities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Surface identity is the most famous psychic in Ahowa County, actually a true psychic... Isn't that a "play"? Old Neil seems to mention that Ms. Dai Li has a similar tendency... Kline feels that he has grasped the core elements of the rapid promotion of the "Psychic" Dai Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, you are still young enough, you are only in your thirties." Klein comforted Dunn and added silently in his heart, just memory A little bad...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn took a sip of coffee and shook his head and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you ask Ms. Dai Li to master and mine the sequence of potions?" Klein deliberately asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den put down the coffee cup and licked the brows on both sides:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She let me Become a real nightmare...I don't know what it means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing a nightmare... Hey, the nightmare makes people feel evil... Klein brows slightly wrinkled, short silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Dunn turned out the pipe and sniffed a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I and Dai Li discussed the fact that the 'divination' potion follow-up is a 'clown'. She did not consider the fact that the members of the congregation deliberately deceived you. She made an interesting guess."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What guess?" Klein's eyes lit up and asked urgently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used divination to prove whether the "clown" is the follow-up potion of the "divination", and got the answer that is vague but closer to the affirmative direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash of Dunn’s sneak peeked at him and said, while thinking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sequence of pathways is a progressive relationship that follows a common point and progresses in a field, such as 'sleeper', 'midnight poet' and 'nightmare', obviously, they are all with the night, and the night Derived from sleep and tranquility, it is conceivable that the follow-up will be like this, but it will be even more powerful, involving more extensive, and there may be hidden, embarrassing, fearful and blushing months..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some sequence paths, on the surface, don't look like this, but after careful analysis, you can still find common places, such as 'Assassin' and 'Teacher', the implicit similarities are given to people Bringing disaster, bringing pain, bringing sorrow, and bringing despair, the latter sequence should also conform to this law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened quite carefully, Proactively ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But 'Divination' and 'small 'Not this relationship?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Dunn sighed softly. "Daily thinks there may be another sequence of relationships, after all. We don’t know enough.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Li said that in a similar way, the low- and medium-sequence potions will provide a new kind of extraordinary power that has nothing to do with before. When a certain qualitative change is reached, these abilities will be combined and evolved. An exceptionally strong 'professional' that contains them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, not a progressive, but a decomposition and combination of relationships."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Klein heard some confusion, Dunn raised his right hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The normal sequence approach is Into, like everyone's body, from a young age, a section becomes higher, mixed with growth, weight and maturity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; special The sequence of the route is this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, Dunn bends his thumb:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"This is sequence 9."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he bends his index finger:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the sequence 8."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, he slowly bent the remaining fingers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Every finger is independent of each other, it seems to have nothing to do with it, but at the end..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When spitting out the word "last", Dunn’s five fingers have All bent up and shook hands into a hard fist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand." Klein suddenly realized that she was deeply impressed by Ms. Dai Li’s speculation and the captain’s metaphor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this is true? He nodded thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sequence 8 "Clown" is very different from Sequence 9 "Divination" and has a new ability, according to the description of the internal data of the night, the corresponding sequence 7 and Sequence 8 "The Clown" has no similar place...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is silent for a while, curious to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Which stages do different abilities combine together and change qualitatively?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng sipped a coffee, hehe laughed:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I and Dai Li both guess it is Sequence 4!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Klein blurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because according to the division of the sequence of the church, sequence 4 is the starting point of the high sequence, which is said to bring about the qualitative change of life and spirit. In ancient times, In the Quaternary, the strongest of the sequence 4 has been qualified as a demigod, but unfortunately, in modern times, such a strong has been very rare." Dunn said with emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sequence 4 to Sequence 1 are high sequence strong, what are the low sequences?" Klein asked with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 9, Sequence 8, Sequence 7, belonged to a low sequence a thousand years ago, but in recent centuries, the number of extraordinary people has been scarce The church also considers sequence 7 as a medium sequence." Dunn laughed at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sequence 9 and Sequence 8 are low sequences, Sequence 7, Sequence 6 and Sequence 5 are medium sequences, Sequence 4 and above are high sequences... Klein is in the heart Repeated it again, it is inevitable a little yearning for love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell is the high sequencer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the higher the sequence, the greater the risk of losing control... Klein thought quite frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes to ask another question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 4th Potion of the Goddess Church What is it called?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I don't know, my confidentiality level can't contact the corresponding information, and I become a bishop or night lover. Deacons can read them.” Dunn shook his head and said, “In fact, at least half of the 13 archbishops and nine senior deacons at the top of the church are below the sequence 4. Well, my statement is more optimistic. The former archbishop, Ings Zangweier, tried to advance the sequence 4 and failed to get out of control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take away the seal "0 The one who is -08"? His name for the potion seems to be called "the janitor"... Klein thought about it and tried to ask: "The sequence 5 of the sleepless route is the 'gatekeeper'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No, that is the way of the psychic. When you become the sequence 7, become the bishop or the night squad leader, you can see the corresponding information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Gatekeeper" is the sequence of the psychic pathway 5? Means guarding the gates of hell? Or, guard the gates of the spiritual world? Klein thought about it with speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, go to the old Neil and continue your studies." Dunn smiled and said, "Don't forget the dinner at night, just old." Weir Restaurant has already booked a location, this time I will officially introduce you to other nights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I am ready for cash." Klein forced his mouth to curl up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
