Inadvertently listening to the "downward man" told by Miss "Justice" suddenly looked up, his eyes were subconscious and became sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just knew that the card at the hand of Mr. Fool was one of the "sick cards" made by Russell the Great, and the name was "Black Emperor". "! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this have anything to do with Mr. Fool? "Inverted man" Alger quickly took a look at the bronze long table, and immediately lowered his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s really the leader of Mr. Fool, this thing is definitely not simple... Alger listens carefully to the follow-up description of Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "magician" Foers who knew this thing and had a guess from Hugh also quietly looked at Mr. "fool" and wanted to The secret reaction exists to see the truth of the matter, but the fools in the thick fog are as calm as usual. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Also, no gain "justice" Audrey paused, continued: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; " The victim was a wealthy Kapyeong. Many rumors identified him as the largest trafficker of Beckland. The Grand Theft Auto 's Black Emperor sneaked into his villa, took his life and saved many innocent girls detained in the dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" When Kapin’s body was discovered, it was covered with a tarot card and the face was 'Judgement' and 'Emperor'. "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; she did not mention things safe, because she felt it does not matter <br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; covered Tarot? This is the logo of our Tarot Club? Wait a minute, "Human trafficker? "The hangman" Alger sharply captured a phrase.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thoughtfully turned to the top of the bronze long table, humbly asked: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool's, is Kaping related to the disappearance of colonial slaves? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter was the task assigned to him by the Storm Church. He once locked a suspect called Barron and asked for "justice" in Beckland. ", "Magic" and "World" help to pay attention.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as soon as he hears "human traffickers", Alger intuitively believes that this is better with the Southland. The tribe evaporates from the air, and there are certain links between the many slaves in the archipelago of the Sea of ​​Sonia.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that only this seems to hide some secrets. Things can make Mr. "fool" interested.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is not excluded that Mr. "The Fool" is a self-determined action, he can not do everything Waiting for the arrangement, like a manned manipulator... "The man hanging down" Alger is thinking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaping and the colonial slaves of the recent period Is it related to the disappearance? Think carefully, don’t rule out this possibility, there are four extraordinary people in his villa, which is not in itself. Often... If he is such a rich man, please get the extraordinary person to be a bodyguard, and at the very least a sequence of 7 plus two sequence 8 or sequence 9 configuration, then that Heras, count the magical items, equivalent to the strong sequence 5 Klein was reminded by the words of "upside down man", and thought a lot about it. I felt that things could be smuggled together.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he could not Affirming my own guess, I can only skip the question of "swinging people" and chuckle one by one: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My leader is in this matter Made some negligible contributions. "; & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; <br <br /> & nbsp />! Really" justice "Audrey eyes bright in my heart cheered loudly <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; &nbsp; Sure enough... This is the first thing I have encountered in the real world related to the Tarot... "Magic" Foers is half-happy and half-sighing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted Man" Alger believes that the words of "Foolish Man" indirectly prove his own guess: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaping this trafficker is absolutely not Simple, otherwise it will not let a secretly-existing leader take the shot, but the simple trafficker has a certain relationship with the probability of a simple slave missing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"He has gained the legacy of two extraordinary people in this matter, hoping to sell it as soon as possible. The two legacy features are a 'Sheriff' for Sequence 8 and a 'Interrogator' for Sequence 7." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheriff, interrogator... Isn’t this the “arbitrator” approach of the Augustus family? Only the royal family, the ancient aristocrats and the military are likely to get... One of them is behind Kaping? It is not possible to rule out the possibility of the Castilla family in the Kingdom of Fenett... "After hanging people" Alger slightly frowned, and it became more and more obvious that the disappearance of slaves was not so simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Justice" Audrey's thoughts are similar to him, and I did not expect that the extraordinary people in the Kaping villa turned out to be "arbitrators". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of mastering the formula is unlikely to be colluded with the trafficker of Kapyeong... Audrey’s lips are stunned and confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sheriff"? “Magician” Foers knows that his friend is spending money on the potion material for this sequence. He is busy sitting up and asking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mr. What is the legacy of the extraordinary?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the same as my expected response, shouldn’t I ask directly how many gold pounds? Also, I did not seem to have said to the "Magician" that the extraordinary characteristics of conservation and immortality law... Klein slightly stunned, and immediately considered the tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this time, "Justice" Audrey took the initiative to speak:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' Fool's, can I answer this question? The corresponding reward is given directly to you by her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She and Folls are friends because of fear of "fool" Mr. refused to share the knowledge in that area, so he volunteered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Kline smiled and responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missing "Justice" is always anxious for me... He feels a heart in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, "Justice" Audrey silently sighed and turned to face Fols, deliberately not using noble pronunciation and proprietary words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to know the answer?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you willing to pay for? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Fols nodded without hesitation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the shadowed figure and respectfully asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. 'Footer', can I pay for the other chapters of "Spiritual Insights"? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She specifically emphasized "additional" because she knew that Mr. "The World" must be sacrificed to Mr. "Foolish" And the knowledge that can be viewed at any time does not seem to have the value of the transaction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that she suspects that the god-level big man like Mr. Fool will peek, just I feel that it is more sincere to change a chapter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At some point, the big man cares about your attitude only...Fuls has seen similar stories in many novels. Discourse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaning against the back of the chair responded with a less careful tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "can. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Mr. ‘fool’. "Magician" Fols uncontrollably reveals a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She intuitively believes that she will be exposed to some hidden high-level knowledge!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey is completely reassured, said with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the extraordinary world, There is such a law, remember, it is the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
