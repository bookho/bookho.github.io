			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, finally passed the psychic's level...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein spit out the turbidity Breathing, slowly turning around, enjoying the tranquility of the night and the cool breeze, while walking close to the apartment door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the key, inserted it in, gently twisted it, and let the black with the blush expand with the sound of screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on the unmanned stairs, breathing cold air, Klein has a wonderful feeling of life a few hours more than others, so much so much that The pace has become brisk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, he maintained a similar mentality and opened his own door, but before he walked in, he saw a quiet sitting in the darkness in front of the desk. The figure, the black hair is red, the brown hair is bright, the face is delicate, and it is Melissa Moretti! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein, where have you been?" Melissa browed and asked, wondering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not waiting for Klein to answer, she added another sentence, it seems to be clear about the cause and effect, logical relationship of the matter, clearly: "I just got up Go to the bathroom and find that you are not at home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has a wealth of experience in deceiving parents, brains, and screams without a hurry to answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After I woke up, I couldn’t sleep a little. I thought it would be a waste of time to exercise. I went out and ran a few laps, you see, sweat." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off his jacket, turned his body halfway, and pointed at his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa stood up and glanced at it with care, for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Klein, in fact, you don't have to, don't have too much pressure, you can definitely pass the interview at the University of Timing, even if you can't, hey, I mean, if you can find better."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven’t considered the interview... Klein nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say that he had already received an "offer" because he had not considered whether he should go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa glanced at him deeply, turned suddenly, trotting into the room, and took out a piece of gear, rust iron, spring and clockwork Turtle-like items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly twisting the clockwork, Melissa placed the item on the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, hey, the "turtle" jumped and walked, very rhythm, and people involuntarily turned their attention to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I feel troubled, watching it move so much will be a lot more comfortable. I used to do this very often, very effective! Klein, give it a try. Melissa dawned brightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t refuse his sister’s kindness, looked at the “turtle” and waited until it stopped to laugh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Simple and regularity can really bring relaxation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting for Melissa to say that he pointed to the "turtle" and asked casually: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do it yourself? When did you do it? Why don't I know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I did it with the materials I didn’t want from the school and the things I got on the road. It was only two days before I got it.” Melissa’s expression was as usual, and her mouth was a little tilted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's amazing." Klein was heartily praised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a boy with poor mechanical skills, he was forced to die when he was a four-wheel drive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa's chin is slightly lifted, her eyes are slightly bent, and her tone is plain: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excessive modesty is a bad character." Klein chuckled. "Is this a turtle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the room suddenly condensed, plum Lisa’s voice is as faint as a blush: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s a doll.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;人偶......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein smiled and forcibly explained:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Material The problem is still too rudimentary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he transferred the topic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" How do you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, is there a toilet inside? And are you not good at sleeping until dawn?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa stunned, passed After a few seconds, I opened my mouth and prepared to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there was a violent digestive sound in her chest and abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I will go to sleep again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! She grabbed the turtle-like "gull" and ran back into the room and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Yesterday's dinner was too good, too much to eat, the stomach was not adapted... Klein shook his head and laughed, walked slowly to the desk, sitting silently On the chair, the red moon from behind the dark clouds, quietly thinking about the invitation of Dunn Smith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerical staff of the night team is very obvious:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a crossover, mysterious gathering The founder of the "fool" has a lot of secrets on his body. He has been swaying for a long time under the eyes of the team of the Goddess Church who specializes in dealing with extraordinary events. The risk is not small;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as they join Dunn Smith, their goal will definitely be to become an extraordinary person, to cover up the benefits from the "party", and to become a full member, freedom must be restricted, just like civilians leave Tingen Like the declaration, you can't think where to go, what you want to do, you will miss a lot of opportunities;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is a strict organization, once there is a task, only Can wait for arrangement, accept orders, can't refuse;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary person has the risk of getting out of control;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bad things are listed in the mind, Klein turns Considering the necessity and the benefits: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the "transportation ceremony" and other encounters, I will not be the lucky one of the 80% of Dunn’s mouth. In the future, there will be strange events that fall into the body, full of dangers. Only when they become extraordinary or join the value of the night, can they have the ability to compete;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; want to be extraordinary, It’s impossible to rely on “meetings”. The problem of the potion formula is not big. The corresponding materials can be found, how to get it, how to make it, and the common sense of ordinary people’s daily practice. There are serious obstacles. Everything asks "justice" and "downside down people", and everything is exchanged for them. This will not only damage the image of the "fool", but also make the other party doubt, and there is not so much time to exchange such small problems. Similarly, They can't find anything they are interested in;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, more material exchanges will leave traces of real identity, when, "online disputes "It is a big problem to turn into "offline conflicts";<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you join the "Night of the Night", you will be able to get in touch with the common sense and related channels of the mysterious world, and accumulate enough corresponding contacts to use this as a fulcrum. Move "meetings" to get the most benefit from "justice" and "downside down", which in turn raises the reality and gains more resources to form a virtuous circle;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, you can also go to join the "psychological alchemy club" that Dunn mouth confided, which is the group that is suppressed by the major churches. It can become a member of them and lose the freedom, even the moment. I have to be scared. The more important problem is that I don’t even know where to look for them. Even if I put out the corresponding information from the mouth of the “downside down man”, the trade contact will be life-threatening;<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small in the wild, hidden in the city, the big hidden in the DPRK, the value of the night may be a better protection color; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until the future, become the top of the arbitral tribunal, Who can think of himself as a heresy, behind the secret organization? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morning light shines, blush disappears, looking at the golden sky, Klein is set Determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to Dunn Smith today and become a civilian member of the night! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't sleep?" At this moment, Melissa got up again and pushed the door out. She was surprised to see her brother stretched out without image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think about something." Klein smiled and relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa indulged in a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I get into trouble, I will be one by one There are two aspects of bad and good. After the list is finished, compare it and you can get the 'tips' that should be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good habits, I That's how it is done." Klein smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa looked stretched, didn’t say more, took the yellow sheet of paper and washed the items to the common bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the breakfast was used, my sister left, Klein didn’t rush out, and got a good sleep, because he knew that almost all the pubs were in the morning. Do not open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At two o'clock in the afternoon, he smoothed the pleats of the top hat with a small brush and a handkerchief, got it dirty, made it clean and tidy, and then went out and dressed. It’s like going to an interview. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besik Street is a bit far away, Klein is afraid to miss the "working time" of the night-timers, not walking, but waiting for the public at the intersection of the Iron Cross Street The arrival of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kingdom of Lun, there are two types of public carriages, which are derailed and tracked. The former is made up of two horses and counts on the top of the carriage. Come to the individual, only the general route, no specific site, flexible operation, on call, unless the guest is full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter is operated by the Orbital Carriage Company. First, a rail-like device is laid on the main street. The horses are on the inside and the wheels are turned on, making it easy and labor-saving. Pulling a larger double-decker, taking nearly 50 guests, the only problem is that the route is fixed, the site is fixed, and many places can't go, it is more dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, the sound of the wheel hitting the track was far and near, and a double-decker carriage stopped in front of the Iron Cross Street site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to Besik Street." Klein said to the coachman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to go to Champagne Street, but when you get there, it takes only about ten minutes to walk to Besik Street." The coachman explained the route problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then go to Champagne Street." Klein nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than 4 kilometers, 4 pence." A young man with a white face next to the driver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the staff responsible for collecting money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein took out four copper pennies from his pocket and handed it to the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the carriage and found that there were not many occupants, even if there were several vacancies on the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are only 3 pence on the body, come back and go..." Klein pressed his hat and sat down firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men and women on this floor are mostly dressed up, wearing overalls and leisurely reading newspapers, but almost no one speaks, quite quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed his eyes to recharge his batteries and did not manage the coming and going of the passengers around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting off the carriage and asking along the way, he soon came to Besik Street and saw the pub with the brown and yellow hound logo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stretched out his right hand and pushed hard. The heavy door slowly opened, and the sound of snoring and the rushing heat wave rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although still in the afternoon, there are already many customers in the pub. They have temporary workers, looking for opportunities here, waiting to be hired, and others are doing nothing. Use alcohol to paralyze yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub is quite dim, with two large iron cages in the center, and the lower third is deep into the ground, leaving no gaps, people holding wooden wine glasses Around, sometimes talking loudly, sometimes cursing and laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein curiously glanced at it and found that there were two dogs in it, one black and white, similar to the huskies of the earth, one dark and shiny. Robust and fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to bet? Doug has won eight games in a while!" A short man in a brown bonnet came close and pointed at it. The black dog said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bet? Klein is a glimpse, and immediately wakes up: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dog fighting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Hoy University At that time, those aristocratic students and rich children will always ask themselves contemptuously and curiously, asking rude workers, unemployed hooligans to like to participate in boxing and gambling in the pub? In addition to boxing and playing cards, does the gambling project contain items such as cock fighting and fighting dogs? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short man smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. We are civilized people, we will not do this "I don't decent things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said here, he whispered: "And last year, laws were also banned from these things..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you betting on?" Klein was curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See who is a good ‘hunter’.” The short man just finished, and there was a sensation in the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and looked excited:[br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This game started, Can't bet, you wait for the next one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean heard the words, raised his toes, raised his head, looked at him, saw two strong Han dragged a sack and came to the iron cage, opened the "prison door" and dumped the things inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a gray, disgusting animal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein carefully identified and found out that it was a mouse, dozens of hundreds of mice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the iron cage is deep underground, there is no gap, the mice are screaming around, but they can’t escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the chain of the two dogs was untied as the cage door closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wang!" The black dog rushed over and killed a mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black and white dog first had a slap in the face, then excitedly played with the mice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around you are holding a glass of wine, focusing on gazing, or shouting loudly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bite Die it! Kill it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doug Doug!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......God TM dog catches the mouse... Kline wakes up and twitches at the corner of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gambling project here is actually which dog is caught by more dogs...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can also be charged a few...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
