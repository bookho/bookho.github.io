			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a glance at Caldera, Klein suddenly became awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t speak again, turned and jumped down the boulder, and walked into the black monastery from the half-opened door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint tower and the square surrounded by a building, there are still a few piles left in the battle, the huge arrows are inserted on the ground, the tail is windy Gently shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franke Lee is still planting something in the pit, but the feet are no longer food, but a muddy flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do with them?" Klein couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank excitedly laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many many!<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, a cow that can meet the meat requirements of the entire boat at one end can be re-grown after cutting a part of it! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Why is it a cow? Klein couldn’t find a language response for a while, and he could only silently draw a blushing month in his heart.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voyage of the sea, Ottolov, who sat on the ground reading books, drunk and drunk, seems to have a tendency to undress, Nina, quietly hiding in the shadow of the corner of Heath. Klein walked into the hall covered by various murals.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson Hood didn’t know when he had an easy chair Lying leisurely on the top, admiring the paintings on the dome that are extremely religious and sacred.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, finally leave this damn sea, Two or three noon and night alternations! "Seeing that Gelman Sparrow came in, this "strongest hunter" sincerely sighed, "As long as I can get out of here, I don't have to worry about any remaining problems." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein originally wanted to let the other person shut up directly, but he seemed to be just targeting himself, not involving others, and he was too lazy to take care of it, and asked casually: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you an Intis?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Absolutely, my father is an Intis, and my mother is a Seghal." Anderson replied with a chat desire.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walked a few steps forward:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Then you are the belief of 'eternal glory', 'the god of steam and machinery', or the 'god of knowledge and wisdom'? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson's expression suddenly became a bit strange:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was originally a belief in knowledge and The god of wisdom', but their pastor is too odious, just because the test scores are not qualified, I ignore my ordinary handsome face, look at me like a fool, hey, I am only a partiality, I IQ Not at all low! I have always been excellent in the fields of art knowledge and painting foundation! Oh, before becoming a hunter, my ideal is to be a painter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, after coming to the sea, more or less will believe a little 'master of the storm'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Anderson’s description, Klein’s mind suddenly produced a paragraph—the pastor of “The God of Knowledge and Wisdom” might say something like this: “The exam failed. The child was not saved, buried. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is about to direct the topic to Anderson's hunter career, after all, this is the dream world, except for the "mysterious queen", the only one who can communicate with him normally. Guy, but suddenly the sound of the opening of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the mural hall, there was a sound of opening the door! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson This guy just said that as long as he can get out of here... Klein has a toothache and looks at the location of the source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately saw a man in a linen robe rushing out of the mural hall and heading straight to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy of the Black" Leo Master! Goodness to Leo Master! Klein recognized the other side and immediately found a tall figure in the depths of the mural hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure is wearing a thick, deep black body armor with two crimson rays in the eye socket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carried a huge straight sword and madly chased Leo Master in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! when! when! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His metal-like boots continually collide with the ground, giving a crisp and rushing sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real Leo Master! The owner of the "Black Saint"! Klein looked at the two figures that were getting closer and closer, and the instincts leaned over and quickly retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He posted it on the wall of the mural hall and found that Anderson Hood did not know when he leaped from the easy chair and attached it to the mural on the other side. on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aware of the sight of German Sparrow, Anderson opened his mouth and returned a smile that "I am like you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is like you? I am not embarrassed. If you are not here, I will come up with the "Poseidon Scepter" and the "Black Saint", fighting for 800 rounds! I have been thinking about it. If Leo Master, who helps kindness, kills the owner in a dream, will there be a corresponding change in the real world...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside, the ship of the "Future", Leo Master's owner is really going crazy, "Mysterious Queen" will definitely shoot...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s no coincidence that a guy left his dreams and came here... The two sides are very close in the real world? Or who leads the kind-hearted Leo Master to come over, "Mysterious Queen"? Klein’s mind flashed a lot of thoughts in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo Master, wearing a linen robe, saw two people in front of him, originally wanted to call for help, but in the blink of an eye, they found that the two people each flashed to the side of the hall. The edge, a pair of things did not see anything and did not want to control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." He ran hard and rushed out of the mural hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black horse knight dressed in Leo Master's eyes is deep red, and catching up, completely ignore the Klein and the two side wall paintings respectively Anderson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they left the hall, Kline, who had some guesses in his heart, took a step without hesitation, as soon as the cheetah followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Anderson raised his right hand and grabbed it twice, failing to stop Galman Spalo in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy was quite sensible just now, how suddenly he was crazy? What problems did he find? It’s so curious..." Anderson probe looked into the eyes The square outside, hesitated for a few seconds, and finally chose to keep up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After chasing the black monastery, to the area where the "Stars will be", Klein saw Leo Master, who wears a linen robe, around the piece. The boulder evades the master and seizes every opportunity to look at the "Giant Wang Ting" projection on the opposite mountain peak and whisper in ancient Hemys:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The Lord who created everything;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the omnipotent..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the circle, the kind-hearted Leo Master continued to mourn: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the root of all greatness, you are the beginning and the end;"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the god of the gods, you are the dominator of the vast world! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the end of this name, the sea of ​​clouds separating the two peaks trembled and slowly separated to the left and right, revealing a deep depth that could not see the bottom." The gap.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite "Giant Wang Ting" projection suddenly absorbs the solidification dusk at a great distance!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
