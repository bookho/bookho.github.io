			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;第12起! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil killer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the corpse heard the sound, Kleingengan was upside down and knew that he had encountered something bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his sight, the decoration of the living room is mainly bright yellow, the coffee table, the sofa and other things are not abnormal, only the carpet is stained with bright red blood. And slowly dip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of the empty female body in the abdomen wound, carrying a large black dog, its mouth half, revealing a sharp tip Trembling white teeth, and above each tooth, there are rust-like dark red marks, which seems to be the result of long-term eating of blood but not often cleaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the large black dog's teeth are still wrapped around the bloody small intestine, and the shredded raw meat is dotted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its head moved over, and the magma-like eyes reflected Klein, who was dressed as a worker, reflecting his disguised face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" A large black dog’s throat screamed in a throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really animals! It is the "demon" of Sequence 6, the "Devil" that is about to be promoted! And the preparations I made today are not aimed at it... Kline’s mind flashed so many thoughts in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, the black dog’s body swelled rapidly and became a monster two or three meters high. Behind it, a pair of huge bats The wings are slowly open, and the horns covered with mysterious patterns are growing next to the ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is wet inside the shiny hair, jumping out of the red and blue flames, and the strong sulphur taste spreads out. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, Klein sneaked a sneak peek into the ground, and rushed to the demon giant dog like a cannonball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stab! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black devil's giant dog swiftly swooped forward, and the claws of the thorny claws shook the afterimage, and they photographed Klein's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent, its claws penetrated the figure, just like penetrating the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s figure is faint and transparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a phantom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusion created by Klein! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he himself has rolled on the ground, close to the convex belly window, and then the left hand presses one by one, the whole body vacates and slams straight The glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After identifying who the enemy is, he made up his mind and immediately ran away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon giant dog saw it, the magma-like eyes suddenly brightened, and there seemed to be a burning flame in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It opened its mouth, filled with stench and uttered a word full of filth, from the words of the devil:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s body suddenly stagnated, and the heart seemed to be caught by the invisible hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure, which solidified in the air, instantly became thinner and lighter, turning into a rough-cut paper man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this paper man is covered with red rust, mottled red rust! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang, squatting, in two difficult movements, Klein’s figure reappeared, smashing through the belly window and slamming into the streetside where the stone slabs were cast The steadicam paper man slowly descended and burned a flame of sulphur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a group of blue red fireballs flew out of its mouth and rushed to the path of the enemy's escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just landed, and immediately picked up a roll, the blue red fireball squatted next to it, but did not immediately explode, seems to be invisible The force is affected and slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein flew out of the distance, the fireball swelled and smashed, breaking the surrounding slate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the demon giant dog to chase, Klein opened his mouth in preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shouted at the scorpion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"killing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Killing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Help!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound seems to have been added with special effects, far away in the quiet night, awakening the residents of the entire street, It was introduced into the ears of patrols separated by two streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil's giant dog slammed into the posture and thought about it for a second, it returned to the room and began to clean up the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Klein’s mad madness disappeared instantly in the shouts of “killing” and “helping”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a house next to it, in the fireplace that was extinguished early, the residual charcoal ignited and ignited an exaggerated flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is like a magician, flashing in this group of flames, and leaping gently, he jumped out with a cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he used the "master key" to open the door at the door, across the wall and quickly fleeing in the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call, at this time, there is no more powerful call for help than a mock-up of a simulated pronunciation." Klein sighed. Take out a bottle of Amanda pure dew and drop a few drops on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the original race of the "Devil" is a dog, he has to be wary of the smell of the other party's special ability to track this one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been worn until another crossroads, and Klein paused and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that it is quieter and has not been affected, he is busy walking to the side of the street and hiring a rental carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the carriage drove a long distance in the middle of the night, Klein really breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that the "devil" would not catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Universal Key" is really weird... It made me lost to the murder scene, and I used it carefully, cautious and cautious... that’s really The animal becomes a "devil"... Where does its potion and formula come from? Does it still have a human companion? How was the target of the serial killings selected? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the good news is that after determining this, it will be much harder to think about it again, and the probability of being caught will increase greatly...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One idea one by one, in the heart of Klein, the carriage is flying fast on the wide unmanned road, running between a gas street lamp . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Klein’s heart moved, and there was a natural picture in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The root pea vines hang down from the sky and interweave into a dense forest road. The coachman does not know how to drive the carriage and continue to drive on those green plants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not good! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not hesitate, slammed into the window and jumped to the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, that root pea vine really hangs down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein frowned and tried to manipulate the flame to ignite the carriage, but his fingers did not make any sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the surrounding area has become extremely quiet, and even the sound of the horseshoe stepping on the green plants and the wheels running over quickly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein tried to calm himself down. He looked out the window and saw that the carriage had traveled along the road woven into the pea vines into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, this is not Beckland... He blinked his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the carriage stopped, and the window was a hammock-like seat in the middle of the pea vine. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; wearing a pair of black boots feet from where drawn, a soft voice but without feeling passed Klein's ear: <br /> <br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you just do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman in the museum...suspected high sequence strong...She didn’t seem to Recognized me, after all, I used to pretend to use Aziz copper whistle... She should have heard the cry for help... Klein’s thoughts became very active at this moment. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; he deliberately swallowed mouth saliva Road: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "I am a private detective, and I A lot of friends are investigating the recent serial killings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a magical item called 'Master Key' that can open the door through the wall, but it will cause Lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this process, I directly ran into the crime scene, because it was not an opponent, I could only run and call for help." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every sentence I said is true... Klein silently added in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he finished speaking, there was no response outside, but he felt that there was a line of sight that penetrated the carriage, penetrated the obstacle, and carried it directly on his own. article. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, I’m on the safe side, leaving Azick’s copper whistle and bookmarks on the fog... At this moment, Klein is so lucky. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cautious and careful is really useful! & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp; <br <br /> & nbsp /> After that unspeakable exceptionally tough silence, but without feeling soft female voice finally spoke up: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The key has a certain curse, not necessary, don't use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice just fell, everything around her change, what pea vine What kind of forest road, what way to the air, all disappeared, the carriage is still driving on the street, driving between the elegant iron black gas street lights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein kept his heart until the carriage arrived near the East End, and he paid 8 Sule's fare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Under normal circumstances, the rental carriage will not enter any street in the Eastern District, because it is likely to be robbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the one-bedroom room at Black Palm Street, Klein changed his clothes and went straight to sleep, not trying to return to Minsk Street after the early hours of the morning - the 12th murder When the case appeared, Beckland’s situation was definitely more tense, and there must be various checks on the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not immediately go to the fog to study the secret of the "bookmark", acting like he described to the mysterious woman, just a low Sequence, some extraordinary detectives of extraordinary ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really an accident tonight, it’s quite exciting, I’m stealing something... well, most of the questions blame the 'master key'... Klein ridiculed himself and soon entered the sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, he breathed his nose and irritated his throat, and slowly returned home, taking the newspapers and letters in the letter box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
