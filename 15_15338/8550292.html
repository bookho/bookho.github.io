			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the bright sunshine in the afternoon, Klein, whose clothes were contaminated with dust, quickly adjusted the firing position of the revolver, opened the corresponding device, and let himself enter at any time. The gun hits the enemy's state, and the brass-colored gun body metal reflects the flowing radiance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds the gun with one hand and stretches forward, alerting to possible changes around him. At the same time, he was a bit worried about Captain Dunn and Mr. Al-Hassen, who was wearing a gray suit and trench coat, because they were all "nightmares". More good at secretly affecting the enemy, the frontal confrontation does not know whether it will work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Klein’s thoughts turned, Al Hasen took the initiative to slow down the pace of the front, and his expression became quiet and sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his mouth and picked up a poem that made people feel like they were at night:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whenever the sun sinks in the West"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dewed beads adorned with dusk"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"She is pale as a moonlight"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"or as the stars accompanying the moon"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Evenings see the grass under the night dew"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elegant and delicate flowers are blooming"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“After the hermits avoid the sun”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......(Note 1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吟诵As the sound echoed, Klein almost lost his sense of tension and relaxed completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, he had a similar experience and was not in the direction of Al Hasen’s face, so he quickly precipitated his spirit and confronted him with a semi-meditation state. The influence of "poetry". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... He secretly sighed and no longer doubted the positive fighting power of Dunn and Ayr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was not long before the promotion, the sequence of potions was not particularly well understood, he just forgot that the sequence 7 "nightmare" was made by the sequence 8 "Midnight Poet "Advanced, can fully retain the previous ability, and has a small increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Klein’s impression of the "Midnight Poet" comes entirely from Leonard Mitchell, knowing that this profession also inherits the speciality of "sleepers". He is good at fighting, shooting, climbing and sensing. He is also good at using different styles of poetry to have different influences on the surrounding creatures. In short, it is a violent poet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay Hasen’s snoring, there was a wave of water swaying next to the piles of large wooden boxes, and a black tuxedo and head appeared. A man wearing a half-high silk hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the man’s face was painted with red, yellow and white oil paint, and he painted the “clown” with high angles on both sides of his mouth and participated with himself. The formal dressing of the dinner form a ridiculous contrast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬! The black Luo Luo, who was introduced as a sharpshooter, sprinted quickly, with a handgun and a fist in one hand. He took the tuxedo clown in a few steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tuxedo clown seems to be influenced by the Al Hashin Psalm, his body is slightly shaken, his eyes are calm and calm, and there is no desire to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! The black-haired lady Loro Tower slanted at the pace of boxing, throwing a fist at the arm and slamming into the face of the clown in the tuxedo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air exploded, the tuxedo clown suddenly broke like a mirror, one piece, quickly evaporated, disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a few steps away from the dark position of the wooden box pile, the figure of the tuxedo clown quickly sketched and re-presented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who was affected just turned out to be a phantom! Just a show! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fingertips fired the sound of firearms, and Luo Luota rushed to the left, tumbling continuously, and evading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, nothing happened except the virtual gunshot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! Pong! Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den and Ayle each raised their guns and stabilized their shots. The tuxedo clowns left and right, and rolled back and forth, as if they were performing acrobatics. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the lady of the dark woman, Luo Luota, did not know where she rushed again. She was called the sharpshooter and she still twisted her arms and swung the boxing enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tuxedo clown was too late to escape, lifted his left arm and blocked his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that he paused, Dunn and Ayr did not hesitate to aim at each other and pulled the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the swallowtail clown slammed the orange flame against the arm of Lolotta’s fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if you let it go, the flame will wrap the tuxedo clown and spread to the Loulu Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! Pong! Dunn and Ayr's left-wheels fired separately and hit the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame is burning rapidly, and soon only the black dust is flying, but the figure of the tuxedo clown appears not far away, half hidden in the stack Behind several wooden boxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his right hand and made another snap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the virtual gunshots, Luo Luota suddenly stepped, did not make a splash, her body was splashed with mud, and bullet holes appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shot of the Tuxedo Clown is no longer an illusion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtual and real, true and false, it is hard to tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! Pong! Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tuxedo clown even slammed the fingers, and when they were hiding, they shot with Dunn and Ayr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such a scene, Loro Tower narrowed his eyes and raised the dark gold long tube revolver held by the left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tuxedo clown suddenly squats and avoids a fatal blow. His half-high silk hat is flying backwards and falls on the dust. The bullet marks bullet holes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several tumbling, he was as flexible as a curled-up climbed up on the stack of wooden boxes, slamming his fingers and launching air bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayr Hassan stepped back and dropped the pistol, starting again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Her beauty is only open to the night"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But night is not worthy of beauty"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Love is completely blind to her"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......(Note 1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuxedo clown keeps Jumping between the wooden boxes, suddenly raising his hand and rubbing his ears, looking at Ayr with a fixed funny smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He won’t block his ears in advance? The sequence of potions mastered by the secret will be strange... Kline looks far away and has some guesses in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His thoughts just flashed, suddenly saw a figure appear on the top of the side warehouse, and quickly ran to the innermost side of Riel Bieber’s hiding That. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tuxedo clown is responsible for leading the captains and others to take notes. Klein's thoughts floated, and the subconscious raised his right hand and shot at the silhouette of the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just had an aim and gave an advance amount, and the figure suddenly smashed and turned to turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not accept the place to pull the trigger, I saw that the figure suddenly stunned, and there was a bloody bloom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure looked at this with amazement and endured the pain and continued to rush to the innermost warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's take a look at the gunmanship... Klein's mouth twitched and pulled the trigger again. This time, the bullet hit the wooden roof next to the figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! Pong! Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard and Borgia also shot separately, but failed to hit the figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wanted to vomit their shots as well as their own, but the fingers of the trigger were hovering there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! Why stop him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn’t the risk of divination out of the warehouse? Let this guy go to the road and step on a thunder, isn't it good? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard and Mr. Borgia should also be for this purpose...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idea In the flashing room, Klein raised the barrel and hit the bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! Pong! Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few shots, the figure came to the roof of the innermost warehouse without any hindrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed down, his elbow hit, and fell into the piece with the broken roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this voice, the eyes of the black-haired lady Loro Tower suddenly became dark, and the left hand made a strange action of pulling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action of the tuxedo clown rolling and jumping immediately, the ankle seems to be tightly held by an invisible hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Dunn did not shoot immediately, but dropped the revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his mouth, and in the case of his throat, he used his own spirituality to resonate with the surrounding air, and the illusory, erratic, eccentric sounds The sound of the sound: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She spent the night driving to the dawn"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But staying in the day Open your eyes"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being blinded to nowhere to hide"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is Stunning and fading in the dizziness"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......(Note 1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action of the tuxedo clown struggling Suddenly powerless, seems to have lost the desire to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayr Hassan raised his pistol, aimed at the enemy, and his finger was about to be pulled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of this light stone fire, there was an unusually scream in the innermost warehouse:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams contain extremely intense fears, as if encountering something terrible that cannot be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment of Klein's creeps, the screams came to an abrupt end, and the innermost warehouse returned to the quiet, making the scalp numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
