			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the infinite fog, the magnificent palace stands quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Moon" Emlin White, who once again came here, just resumed his sight and saw the opposite "Justice" looking to the top of the mottled long table. Greetings briskly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon, 'Mr. Fool'~"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Agree" "Audrey" in turn, from "fool" to "world". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This order is not based on the arrangement of the seats. According to the rules of the Tarot, the "fool" contains all possible beginnings, and the "world" is perfect sublimation. end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit of obsessive-compulsive disorder for Miss Olympian sorcerer, which appears after more and more members of the Tarot Club are getting more and more neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a well-born, carefree girl... Emlin’s pretendingly judged a deep sentence and politely responded to the other’s greetings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, the corner of his eye swept the "sun" next to him, and couldn’t help but think of the detailed history of the blood family in the "Baron" of Wimandi in recent days. Experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of details that I don’t know. Professional researchers and amateur fans really have differences, but from this week, I, ang Mlin White, who will be a professional researcher... The Baron Wimandi has not mentioned anything related to Silver City. I can't ask directly. As a bloody Savior with a secret, I must be cautious in similar aspects... Half a day to attend classes, go to church for a long time, accompanying people at night, this life seems to be good... Emmlin’s thoughts gradually spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he frowned and found a very important question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Why do you still go to the harvest church every day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, as a noble blood family, there must be an end to the work, and more patients have recently It is not a good thing to spread the reputation... "Moon" Emlin's brow gradually stretches and softens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Miss Justice have completed the greeting, reached out and knocked on the table, looking at the other side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What you need..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey pressed his right hand and made a stop gesture, then smiled and said: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the transaction is repeated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the reading time of Mr. 'Footer'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the voice of the vampire, the fruit of the tree of the elders and the blood of the mirror dragon have at least one kind... Audrey, you will become a "psychological" "Doctors"! It is almost the middle of the sequence! Audrey's mood is more and more pleasant, and the eyebrows are all smiling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks at the thick fog In the figure, the tail is raised and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Dear Mr., I got a three-page Russell Diary~"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only four pages...she thought about it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Miss Justice, I’m doing a demonstration,” The magician "Falth also said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool's, I also have three new Russell diaries here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is also full of expectations for this Tarot party, because her second "apprentice" potion digestion progress is much faster than expected, the day before yesterday is completely Solved this hidden danger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik followed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Great 'fool', I transcribed some legends of ancient gods. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he again said "downside down":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The surrounding area of ​​the monster The list is also organized. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a real child, no need to be reminded by others... The well-received Klein is very emotional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, there is no progress at all... Although this will make my gain less difficult, but it also hides the risk of losing Silver City data... Exposure is a The question that must always be vigilant... "The hanging man" Alger slightly shook his head invisibly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell’s diary and the legend of the ancient gods soon appeared, flashing to Klein’s palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly browsed through it and found that two pages in the six-page diary were previous repetitions, such as one of the contributions of Miss Justice and the "hanging man" "A match submitted last year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that cannot be avoided unless I can let them really learn Simplified Chinese... Klein sighs and uses the idea to transfer the two pages of diaries to the end. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining four pages of diaries do not record too valuable information, most of them belong to Russell’s loss of ideals, indulging in money, full of "What did I invent today?" "What are I going to invent tomorrow?" "How many gold coins I sold" and "How much investment I got?" I saw Klein almost unable to control his expression, just want to slap these diaries Go to Russell's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "Justice" Audrey was also keenly aware that the "Black Emperor" card was back, quietly covering the hands of Mr. "fool" side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it really a gift to help him complete his mission? Hey, there is another possibility, this is the new "Big Card", not the original one! Audrey guessed with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the diary, Klein resisted the urge to breathe a sigh of relief and turned his attention to the legend of the ancient gods provided by the little "Sun". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a relatively crude narrative, dividing the eight ancient gods of the Second Age into three camps, the giant king Olmer, the elven king Suniaso Liam and the vampire ancestor Lilith are allies, against the "dream dragon" Angel Weide, the ancestors of the ancestral prince Gregory, the alien king Kwahitun, and the demon king Fabri and the demon wolf Regra belongs to wanting to subvert all order and pollute the existence of all living beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the record of Baiyincheng, the eight ancient gods have descriptions of tyranny, evil, cruelty, horror, etc. Even if the shape is the most normal, it is called 'beauty The incarnation of the vampire ancestor Lilith, also a disgusting side, for example, turned into a group of meatballs called mountains, filled with a variety of reproductive organs, and sprayed a thick black mist, constantly making each A strange creature, anyone who is close to Him, will be dominated by mating and breeding desires and become the corresponding organ for walking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seeing the creatures of this scene, except for the ancient gods, without any exception, lost their senses, or mutated on the spot, or became a madman, the record of Silver City Originated from the classics of the giant Wang Ting, of course, this is what they claim to be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not rule out the smashing of allies... This performance is quite close to the bloody prayers after the "primitive moon"... This is the "moon" way to go One of the last features... Thinking of it, Klein almost raised his head and scanned Emlin White. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the legend of Silver City, the vampire ancestor Lilith is indeed in charge of the Red Moon, and as long as He is willing, He can make 365 days a year. It is the bloody month, let the negative power plunder the earth, let the spiritual world interact with the reality for a long time, and release countless unspeakable monsters and evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the power of the gods...I don’t know if there is no difference between the ancient god and the present true god, how are they like a sacred god... in the blood family In the legend, Lilith is not like this. Is there a party between them and Silver City? Or there has been a certain change in the middle. Lilith has changed from the record in the Silver City to the legend of the blood family. Klein took his eyes back and took note of the details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let the paper in his hand disappear, and then leaned back:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can start ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey immediately opened her eyes and looked at Emlin White. Brightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. 'Moon', is there any information about the fruit of the tree of the elders and the blood of the mirror dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin chin lightly :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A total of £750.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you pay such a sum of money, they will soon belong to you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, there is my reward, £100. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey did not calculate the total price at all, and responded with joy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope to complete the transaction today or tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." The "moon" Emlin, who earned 100 pounds, could not refuse the request of Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great! Audrey hangs her right hand and holds her fist and shakes it twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "hanging down" Alger looked at the vampire with a look:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The legacy of the bloody baron, do you want it? 4,500 pounds, this is the best price I have won for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, that The pirate is willing to let go of 3,200 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin’s expression suddenly became a bit distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is only 1,000 pounds, I definitely want it, but...he responded in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although their family are quite good pharmacists and doctors, the annual income is not too small, and they live long enough, it should be able to make a fortune Wealth, but since falling in love with people, Emlin can no longer save money, and occasionally will take the initiative to order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he has not yet earned the £100 reward, his personal deposit is less than £500, which is the detective of Sherlock Mori. Contributed 150 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, let me think about it." "Moon" Emlin struggled and suddenly felt that he should find some ways to quickly save money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin this guy made a poor voice... Seeing this scene, Klein happily tweeted in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, he is a friend of the vampire, listen to the other person, over the years, the money spent on the doll totals more than 7,000 pounds, which makes Klein I am quite lamented by the expensiveness of the dolls and the luxury of Emlin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem." "Inverted people" did not urge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to "justice" Audrey:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Premier Miss, Craftsman I have finished the production and got a pretty magical item.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It allows you to truly change the look and master the manipulation of fire, damage transfer and dangerous intuition Three extraordinary abilities that enhance your balance and agility. It is a silver-white mask, also a hat, earrings, which can change its shape, you can name it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, it also has its own small flaws. When you wear it, your emotions will be magnified, you must know how to control yourself, otherwise it is easy There is a problem.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's price is 5,500 pounds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, "pour the hang" is a chuckle, to the "world":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The extraordinary character you provide is £4,500, and the craftsman's production value is £1,000. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,500 pounds, much better than I expected, although it is divided into 15%, that is, 675 pounds to "slow man" Mr. Klein immediately manipulated "World", nod agree:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotions will be magnified? According to Teacher Islant, when I am promoted to a "psychologist," there is an ability to influence the emotional and psychological state of others. It should be for yourself... well, that flaw is not a problem! "Justice" Audrey nodded lightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will receive that magical item Pay within the next two days. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to reveal the secrets of the Tarot Club, she must wait for the exact item to be reimbursed for the count of the father Hall.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
