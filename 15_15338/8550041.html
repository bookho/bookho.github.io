			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the "fool" question, Audrey did not answer the first time as before, but instead looked at the crystal eyes and looked at it with a scrutiny attitude. "Looking down people". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger did not consciously converge on physical movements, and after a few seconds of silence, he said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I found two pages of Russell's diary and remembered their contents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a page." The sight is separated by fog. Li, replied in a bystander tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good." Klein didn't let his delight and disappointment infect the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is delighted that there are three full pages, and the disappointment is only three pages, because the first collection is definitely relatively easy, and it is the potential of its own resources and channels. Once you dig, it will become more and more difficult to wait for the follow-up, and more factors will be involved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are now 'expressing' out?" Audrey calmly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Klein nodded succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He maintains his previous posture, hardly making changes, and must be cautious in front of the "audience." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As his voice fell, Audrey and Alger immediately appeared in front of a yellow-brown parchment and a dark red pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two picked up the writing tools and began to recall the symbols in their minds and give them an urgent expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the yellow-brown parchment has more lines of text, some are righteous, some are graceful, some are slanting . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than a minute, Audrey and Alger’s forcible contents were all printed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought, the three pages of parchment flashed into his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the eyes swept, he browsed the diary and found that the language order was reversed, and the content was missing and typo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the experiment proves that a certain degree of order error does not affect Chinese reading, and that he is tortured by the asterisk and has no meaning for missing words and typos. Fear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On April 8th, I stood at the bow of the 'Black Throne' and opened my arms and said to Green and Edwards: 'Wanted My treasure? Then look for it at the end of the foggy sea. I hide all the treasures here! 'They don’t understand my humor at all. I even asked if I really have extra treasure. It’s really boring. Ah, you can't do my Apocalypse four knights!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On April 11th, an unnamed island was found that was not on the safe waterway. There are a lot of extraordinary species on it, no, I prefer to call them super-species, which is more pressing. Besides them, there are many strange creatures on the island. I think if Darwin crosses, there is no way. Write the theory of evolution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"April 15, ? Get a little weird, is infected by what you "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; When Russell was born in the Kingdom of Great Yin Disi voyage too? The foggy sea should be the sea in the west of the Intis Republic... Well, you have to go to the library to find some historical information to compare... Klein quickly read a page and turned his eyes to the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he no longer conceals his own understanding of the secret symbols of Russell the Great, because this is a fool-like behavior, and Audrey and Al Jay did not speak, sitting quietly waiting, they seemed to be surprised at the result of this phenomenon, and even thought it would be correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On October 2nd, they decided to let me get engaged with Matilda of the Abel family without consulting me beforehand! God. I haven't even seen her yet! No, I have to refuse! Even if I leave home, even if I am self-reliant, I will fight against this arranged marriage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"October 5, Miss Matilda is so beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"October 6, her personality, her temperament It’s all that I like, and I’m starting to look forward to our marriage.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, the emperor, your fucking... Klein leaned back on the high back chair and prevented the emotion from penetrating the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that the early Russell did not write a diary every day, generally encountered something, need to vomit, need to record, need to express emotions, Will raise the pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down, Klein looked at the last piece of the diary on this page:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 9th of the month, they even called me the son of steam. I like it very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the contents of the previous two pages is of little value for the time being, Klein is inevitably a little disappointed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was not frustrated, he changed the third page diary to the top, and the front and back of this page were written:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On May 21, the church of the craftsman's god gave me two choices, the beginning of two sequence paths, and the one is the 'common person', which belongs to their own The complete sequence chain that is mastered, one is 'the voyeur', obtained from the Morse Penance, lacking a higher sequence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May 2 On the 12th, my choice is very simple, 'common people'! There is a complete sequence of 'generalists'! Although mastering more occult knowledge helps me find a way to go home, the problem is that I am not enough In a strong situation, it is inevitable to use external forces through such things, and external forces are good or bad, good or malicious, uncontrollable, very dangerous. If so, it is better to let yourself become stronger and rely on your own strength to go back. The complete sequence is the primary factor I considered!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May 20 On the day, I became a 'common person'. By the power of the potion, I completely recalled the knowledge, physics, chemistry, etc. I had learned before."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember not only I have a deep understanding and mastery of them, haha, this is a 'professional' tailored for my exotic visitors, to maximize my strengths. I have to say that if I go back in this state and return to the third year, I will definitely become the champion. If there is more standardized and deeper professional study, scientists are not too difficult targets."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On May 26th, I enjoyed the identity of 'common acquaintances." A strange thing, when I became a 'common person', everything I did was in line with it. When locating, the whispers that made me almost crazy were a lot quieter. The temper that broke out from time to time was also controlled and I remembered the diary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the 'playing' that the mysterious Mr. Zaratu mentioned to me? This or It is the key to solving the hidden dangers of potions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at this page diary and felt that he and Russell had obvious personality and style. difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when I go home, I am thinking more about escaping the dangers and achieving the goal by deepening my occult knowledge, and Russell’s idea is By yourself, the danger is in your hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to say that sometimes I admire such people. Maybe everyone will be eager for something they don't have... Of course, I also have to consider the things that are powerful, and both hands must be hard..." One thought came to the mind of Klein, and he was embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Russell’s description of the hidden danger of the potions made him have a lot of confidence in the summary of last night, and the essence of “playing” A clearer grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the three-page diary, Klein looked up at "justice" and "downside down", smiling slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I am fascinated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ao Lili smoothes the inner enthusiasm and smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, I look forward to the day when I can exchange information from you to the Russell Diary Diary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "That is a price to pay." Klein smiled at the "justice" and swept through the silent "upside down man". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey holds hands and puts them in front of them:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Fool, pour Mr. Hangman, I have three questions I would like to ask. If you think the answer is of great value, let me know what you want and I will try to find it later.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
