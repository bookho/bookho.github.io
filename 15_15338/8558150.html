			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one black death number...Other ships are afraid of being discovered, too late to escape, and parked outside the waters of the Rothde Islands? This is a good news... Klein retracted his gaze and deliberately bit his lip with his teeth to show his inner peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Yilian’s side face, Misor lit the torch and swayed continuously, signaling the flagship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, a small boat came over and took him and Klein, disguised as a red-haired Elaine, and returned to the Black Death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the raft being lifted, Klein boarded the flagship of another pirate general and, under the leadership of Misor, entered the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waitress with a blonde hair in front waited, his eyes glanced at Elaine indifferently, pointing to the side of the room:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attitude, living is the feeling of a loved one to meet... The charm of this disease is really true for men and women. ... Klein raised his vigilance, handcuffed, his face, and followed the blonde maid into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally thought that he would immediately see Trey, get a one-on-one chance, the whole person is ready to go, but the carpeted room is small, except There are no wardrobes, sofas and full-length mirrors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Trey deliberately cold and expressing his anger? Klein recalled the romance novels and dog blood TV dramas he had seen, and he speculated on the intention of "sick girl". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde maid was dressed in men’s clothing, but because of the lack of makeup, she lacked the neutral beauty of Elaine, and walked two steps, opened the closet and pointed at the numerous clothes inside. Skirt:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The captain does not like what you are, change it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;艹... Klein burst into a thick mouth in his heart. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also thought that by relying on the men’s Yilian appearance, he could directly see the “sickness lieutenant” Trey, and he was glad that he could achieve his goal without being too ashamed. The result is still not able to escape the most unwanted part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ilan was there, the blonde maid gave her a look:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You only have two Choose, change for yourself, or, I will help you change!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein learns the usual movements of red hair Elaine, small mouth inhalation: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open my handcuffs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his body halfway and pointed his chin at the door:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sly scorpion..." The blonde maid snorted. Ilian’s handcuffs were opened with Misor’s key to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she left the room and closed the door, Klein walked to the closet and stood there, staying for nearly twenty seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he closed his eyes and extended his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, he came to the full-length mirror and saw the red lotus inside, the tourmaline flashing, wearing a golden red dress. The waist ribbon is formed into a flower, which is tightly packed and is slim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yilian’s soft face is a bit red, her lips are tight, her expression is condensed, and it feels very similar to the previous photos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw that he became such an image. One was a bit shameful, but the dressing had just adapted to the initial stage, and no one else existed here. Second, gradually found a different feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that he slowly likes similar things, but in the process of pretending to overcome the heartache, self-consciousness has taken off. It is as if the soul has already flown out of the body, calmly watching "Ilian" wearing a woman's dress in a condescending manner, adjusting the mirror, thinking that this is a means of mission, and that there is nothing shameful and strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein feels that this feeling is very familiar, trying hard to think back, trying to compare it, trying to fix it and master it clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, he found the source, which is similar to playing a role-playing game, choosing a female number, carefully pinching his face, choosing clothes, and making his eyes beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no insignificant and shameful component in it, one side is the perspective of God across the screen, the attitude is transcendent, and one side is seriously playing, passing the plot, both perfect Integration, regardless of each other, will not cause psychological barriers and cognitive impairments due to playing a game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...Klein’s semi-closed eyes suddenly opened, feeling that this is the “no face” state that I want! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can pretend to be anyone, but only yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incorporating the role, trying to play, while taking away the emotions, indifferently examining, and through the contrast, identify yourself and find the truest self! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Incorporate and withdraw... This is the practical application of the most important code of the faceless." Klein suddenly calmed down, residual shame and change of mind at the same time presence. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He takes the attitude of pulling away from the attitude of playing a role-playing game, examining himself in the whole body mirror, and seriously finding a place that is not good enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately, I let Daniz get two sets of women's clothes in advance to study the components, otherwise there is no way to wear them so fast for the first time. It's easy to reveal flaws, oh, this is called professional. Women's clothes are really complicated... From the perspective of 'no face people', Yilian's facial features and facial lines have many defects, beautiful and beautiful, come to me. Said, absolutely not amazing... Well, in this state of mind, I can clearly feel the digestion of the potion..." Kline looked at himself in the mirror, just like watching a character named Elaine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was knocked, and the blonde maid asked impatiently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately sinks his face, as if the other party owed him 10,000 gold pounds has not been returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stayed in this state and walked to the door and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde waitress glanced at him and raised his hand and shouted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hands back.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a prisoner now! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the red-haired Elaine is already in the black death, she is not worried that the other party will be violent, but she simply wants to humiliate the other.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein snorted, half turned his body, and took up his hands, because the other party didn't pay much attention to his appearance and relaxed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; wearing handcuffs, he led by the blonde maid, came to the captain's room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is half-covered, with a warm feeling The scent is filled out, not too strong, but long enough, it is endless, and it is not a pleasure to go to bed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde maid raises her hand Knocking on the door, just about to open, I heard a female voice that was slightly low but soft enough:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let her come in alone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde lady’s face suddenly became gloomy, pushing the door open and using her eyes to signal Klein to go in.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The most critical "exam" came... Klein took a breath and walked into the room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was behind him, the door was closed, he would Inside and outside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stepped on the thick carpet and saw a pretty lady sitting on the desk by the candlelight on the golden lamp stand. The legs of the beige trousers stretched out obliquely and rested on the cross.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyebrows were long and straight, a pair of blue eyes were sharp and bright, the upper body Only wearing a white linen shirt, the scenery inside was faintly revealed, and the black hair curled down to cover the key, so that Klein suddenly became uncomfortable.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Seeing the red hair Elaine came in, "Disease Lieutenant" Trey raised his left hand and asked like a smile and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
