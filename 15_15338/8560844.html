			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160 Burke Lund Street, second floor restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just bitten the toast that the servant had put on the butter and saw the butler coming in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter took a ritual:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr., someone with an unknown origin last night It rang our doorbell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the time is already late, I didn't wake you up, just let the servants take the double-barreled shotguns and take turns to stay for one night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you allow, I will visit a nearby police station today to allow them to strengthen night patrols in this neighborhood."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please ask such a housekeeper, except for expensive, there are no other shortcomings... Klein gently daggers and drank the fresh milk that he just sent:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burke 39 Lund Street, home of the House of Lord Maht. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hayul entered the living room on the second floor and saw her mother Liana chatting with the housekeeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" She rubbed a dark green hair behind her ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea Anna laughed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the middle of the night, someone rang the Dontes family The doorbell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prank?" Hailuer found a position to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nobody knows, in short, Dontes’s housekeeper went to the police station this morning." Liana said the news from the servant population. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hayul’s position is very small:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Let the police intervene is the best ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is completely useless, because I don’t know who is ringing the doorbell. It is said that one person is useless." Liana Shaking his head and laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heilouer snorted and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The scene is useless ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Dontes’s housekeeper seems to just let the police station strengthen the night patrols in our neighborhood. This is a good thing." As a member of the House of Commons. Mrs., the daughter of the barrister, Liana has a very good relationship in the police department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One is useless..." Haiyul repeated in a low voice and fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, she left the living room and returned to the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, she couldn’t help but hold her fist and waved forward a few times. It seemed to be testing something, with obvious doubts in her eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the master bedroom, Klein looked at the large amount of gold coins stacked in front of him. The eyes are full of bright colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a total of 4,000 pounds of gold coins! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a week of raising, "Star Over" Jia Delia finally completed the "Lucky Balance" transaction, in addition to these coins, also paid 6500 pounds in cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, such a large number of gold coins are indeed more visually impactful than the same size of banknotes... Klein sighs and takes out from his pocket From the "blood above" Seignor's 13 Lun gold coins, throw them into the same kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently, Rinett Nicole, with four blond red-eyed heads, appeared in the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms., this is the first sum, worth a total of 4013 pounds." Klein took his eyes back from the pile of coins and looked to Miss Messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that he is a bit curious about how the messenger Miss has to move such a large number of gold coins, he remembers that the other party received a bite with a tooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good..." "There are still..." "Five thousand..." "Nine hundred..." "Eight..." "Seven... "Lenitt 缇 Nicole's head said in turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not remind me... Klein squeezes a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will raise it as soon as possible. "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;. Lei Nite Ti Nicole no longer speak, one of the head trying to open his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, she became dark and deep in front of her, all the gold coins are like running water, attracted by the whirlpool, rushing to the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, a lot of gold coins disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenitt 缇 Nicole four heads at the same time, and then returned to the spirit world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still 8156 pounds of cash plus 5 pieces of Luen gold coins... I can barely say that it is a rich man...I really have any investment opportunities, I can make a solid money. Instead of raising the price and talking about it... In this way, it will not be suspected to be a liar in the short term... Oh, optimistic, maybe the investment opportunity afterwards will allow me to earn back the previous expenses. Money is always fast... Klein breathed a sigh of relief and turned his eyes to the window, forcing himself to admire the misty streetscape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Eastern District after the night, the gas lamps are scarce and often destroyed It’s dark, as if it’s hiding countless monsters and sins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh Dilcha wears a hooded cloak, turns into an alley, and comes out of a seemingly dilapidated house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the new Eastern Party she had mentioned to Fols! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh is not anxious to knock on the door according to the agreed secret number, but first looked down on his own dress and dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unusually, she wears a pair of boots today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This boot looks nothing weird, but Hugh is very clear, its sole is very thick, and there are many things inside, which can make a person "out of thin air" Quite a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can effectively mask the biggest features of Hugh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched the hidden three-sided thorn, Hula hooded, rhythmically ringing the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, she was introduced into the living room of the house and sat down to find a place to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the attendees came together, the convenor of the party finally came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is medium-sized, about 1 meter 75, wearing a black classical robe, a spired country magician hat, with a brass cast on his face. The mask has a quaint and mysterious temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skin is dark, but not brown, like the people in the Fenerbode Dixi Bay area... but this is not certain, maybe it is sun... ...hair black, micro-volume, this is in line with the first judgment... I used the "Sheriff" attitude to look at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man wearing a brass mask looks around in a circle and laughs at two channels:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can call me Mr. X."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. X... Hugh’s mouth couldn’t help but twitch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, she is very clear that the gods of the Aurora will use the letters as the code name, and they like to call a certain lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in her opinion, so self-proclaimed in front of outsiders, there is a feeling of active exposure of the identity and the origins, after all, members of the party can not be all Less, extraordinary people with knowledge and fragmentation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not afraid of being reported? No wonder the gentleman of the MIJ said that Aurora would be mad and could not understand their behavior with the logic of normal people... Since Mr. A disappeared, there were several appearances in Beckland to pretend to be his name or his companions to gather for a party. The matter of interest, the principals were quickly reported and arrested... Well, this Mr. X is not necessarily the Aurora, and perhaps the same as those of the previous ones... take a look back and watch the party quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rarely reports similar things, because she has had a hard-and-existing experience of the wild, and it’s not easy to understand that, as long as nothing happens. Unexpectedly, she will not provide corresponding information to MI9. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is determined to be the god of the Aurora, then you have to report that they are crazy, it will bring great harm... Watch others exchange messages or complete transactions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not participate in depth, first because there were no items and intelligence that were too interesting, and second, to save money for the "interrogator" potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End the party and return to the home in the Jowood area, Hugh I saw that Fols painted a mask that was said to be able to hydrate, and was lying there leisurely reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How? What about the party?" Fols pretended to pretend casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh will throw the cloak aside:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a lot of parties, and the items that appear are also A lot, but also focus on the low sequence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first meeting, certainly no one will take out the good things directly." Fols put down the novel in his hand . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Hughed down the next line, "The organizer of the party claimed to be Mr. X, but it has nothing to do with Mr. A, no one knows." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X Mr.... Suspected of the Aurora will make... Will it be Louis Wien? The spirit of Fols is alive, and he is lazy and leans back: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does he look like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "He wears a mask!" He took a look at Folsley. "Do you think my sight can penetrate the obstacle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no I mean, his overall image." Fols saw Louis Vaun's full-body image in his teacher Dorian Gray, knowing the other's image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a "security officer", Hugh did not bother to restore Mr. X’s image and said with doubt:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter whether it has a relationship with Mr. A, such a name is likely to be reported, he will not worry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buddha Ersi listened to the description of Hugh, and saw the portrait she showed with the help of the "Sheriff of the Sheriff". My heart was already dark and I thought that Mr. X was probably a traitor to the Abraham family, Louis Wien! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not worry about reporting because he is a “traveler”. What accidents can escape with ease? If the official organization follows the experience of Mr. A, there is really no way to leave him... Fols silently, no more talk about this topic, and instead asked about other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she took a shower, she was busy using the "Astrologer" ability to ask her own spirituality and overlap the image of Louis Wien with the image of Mr. X. Together, getting them is the answer of a person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really!" Fols stood up and was excited and delighted to walk back and forth in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her first thought was to report to the major churches, with tips on the ability to have a "traveler", and immediately remembered that they had tried to hire the "world" before. Mr. assassinated Louis Wien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
