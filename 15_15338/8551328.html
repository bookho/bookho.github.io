			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After lunch, after filling his stomach, Klein had only rested for half an hour and rushed to the shooting club to practice the firearms, not to have a little relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the feeding of thousands of bullets and day-to-day persistence, his current shooting level has finally reached the pass line that Dunn Smith thinks, fixed The target is especially good. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After and after repeated mechanical exercises, he took the revolver and took the public carriage to the vicinity of the residence of the fighting teacher Gao Wen, and walked to the gate in ten minutes. In front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he put on the newly-kissed knight's practice clothes, and he has practiced the pace and punches from running, skipping, weightlifting, and squatting. The sweat is flowing and the body is exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Response for fifteen minutes." The blonde, white-faced, high-winded Gao Wenyu took out his pocket watch and slammed it open and glanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the beginning to the present, he has remained silent, only to remind the two words when changing the training method and some of Klein's actions are not standardized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gasped, didn’t dare to rest directly, and walked back and forth slowly – the most intuitive response to this time’s fighting practice was The skin is a lot darker and turns into a so-called wheat color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gao Wen put a good pocket watch, standing next to the rough driving range behind the house, looking at Klein with his arms folded, quiet as a marble statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, in addition to freehand fighting, how can you teach me how to use straight swords, big swords, stabbing swords and rifles?" Just digested the "Divination" Klein of the potion was in a good mood and took the initiative to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen straight swords, stabbing swords and other weapons and chest armor, body armor in Gao Wen’s collection room, knowing that the other party is not only good at unarmed fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gao Wen, who was bathed in the sun, swept his eyes and said in a low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have no use in learning these things. They are things that are behind the times. They can only exist in museums and private collections..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He silent for a few seconds And the tone of the vicissitudes added: "They have been eliminated... You should pay attention to the firearms, even if fighting, it is only an aid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kleinwang The grinning teacher, who was very angry, laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "All the ministers, all the members, all the generals think so." Gao Wen said with a bite of his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stopped and pretended that he was typing, like a real keyboard powerhouse:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, they just exit the frontal battlefield and have other uses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why must fighting be the opposite of firearms? They are completely Can be combined, I believe that more flexible and agile people with faster response can better play the role of firearms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the silent high-text eyes Sharpened, Klein continued to say with smugness: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The other weapons have not been eliminated, just need to make some improvements to make them more portable... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...we can organize a very mobile team, bypassing the frontal battlefield, going straight to the enemy's rear, and rushing to their center... ...in this small-scale assault, soldiers with excellent fighting abilities and good at all kinds of weapons can play quite heavy The role, you can imagine such a scene..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He plays a role in understanding everything, and describes the way the special forces fight on the earth. Come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaowen’s breathing didn’t know when it started to get heavy. He stood there, motionless, and seemed unwilling to break the fantasy picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, what do you think of my thoughts? Is there any possibility of achieving it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaowen’s body trembled as if he finally woke up from his dreams. He glanced at Klein deeply, his mouth low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The effect of your rest is very good, now I will redo the previous exercises to ten groups. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Klein looked blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he started to run again and he woke up and screamed in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 group? Teacher, don't! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t want to “grate” in this way to completely digest the “Divination” potion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, are you not touched? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Klein running to the other side of the training ground, Gao Wen suddenly fell Open hands and clasped the face with a single palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are tightly closed, and the wrinkles on his face are deep and eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who almost got tired, took a shower and changed Clothes, and the still silent fighting teacher Gao Wen farewell, took the public carriage and left the other's residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not go home directly, but went to the Dragon Bar in the Docklands, intending to go to the underground trading market to learn about the price of extraordinary materials and to buy items for making spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, Klein took care of the small vaults that he carried with him, and he did not dare to sleep, and it was very difficult to reach the destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to pay 4 pounds for the commission, I can only use 3 pounds and 5 sul..." He touched the banknote in his pocket and held it. The cane came out of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sun has begun to fall, the dusk shines all the houses, and the "boxing" and "dog-catching" games in the Dragon Bar are Preheat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the billiard room, through a heavy room, Klein entered the underground trading market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and did not find the "monster" Admiralol who was always active here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Neil is not saying that the owner of the evil dragon bar, Swein, is taken over, giving a bite to eat, can the 'monster' survive?" Ryan whispered a little in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a night-timer, he was wary of similar things, so he approached the brawny who was at the door and asked:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about Admiral?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brawny replied with no smile: "I don't know I hid in which corner to sleep. He has always been like this. He has been lying and shivering. He has been screaming 'dead, dead, all dead, dead.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; What screen did he see again? What stimuli have you encountered? Klein frowned and asked a few words carefully, trying to figure out where Admiralol was sleeping, but the guards didn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I am busy, find him with divination and see what happened to him..." Klein took note of this and walked towards it. One of the two rooms at the end of the trading market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the old Neil, the room on the left is used for lending and returning, and the room on the right is the place to sell and purchase precious items, including extraordinary materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocking on the door of the right room, Klein found that there were two inside and outside, and three customers were waiting outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lowered the half-high silk hat, sat in the order behind the three customers, leaning forward, pressing the cane, waiting silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein let the left tooth smack two times, looked at him with "Lingshi", looked at the other three customers, and there was nothing too unusual. Of course, certain minor illnesses still exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another ten minutes, it was finally his turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the partition door and walked into the kerosene lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-locking the door, he sat in the chair belonging to the customer, looking at the old man wearing a black bonnet:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to know what extraordinary materials you have, what is the price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s cheeks are drooping and his eyes are wrinkled. But the figure is quite burly, and he is not surprised by Klein's request, because many customers are unwilling to let people know what he wants to buy before determining that there is something extraordinary. They generally want to introduce them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man turned to the latest pages of the notebook, looked at Klein and picked up the honey in front of him and snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The brain tissue of the water ghost, depending on the degree of completeness, ranging from 3 pounds to 15 pounds, the star crystal is 150 pounds per 50 grams, the queen bee grass is 200 pounds, the adult black spotted frog, Each 170 pounds... face rose, 280 pounds, only one..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein controls his emotional reaction, quietly listening to the introduction of the old man And such an underground transaction has less than thirty extraordinary materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched the 7-pound banknote in his pocket, and thought about the attitude of Miss Justice to 1000 pounds. Klein got up silently and sighed:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately, there is nothing I want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the old man asking, he turned quickly and opened the partition The door, went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the underground trading market, Klein looked ahead, stayed for a few seconds, and smiled in his heart and said:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am probably the poorest secret organization BOSS..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes him more determined to get materials from the insiders or find The idea of ​​justice and exchange of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two rounds of the underground trading market, Klein chose to purchase materials for making spells, such as semi-finished silver, such as the herbal powder needed for the ceremony. And natural ore, spent a total of 15 pounds of soler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total amount of private money is 5 pounds and 10 sules, and the final amount of the commission is removed, and there is 1 pound and 10 sul... Kleinmer counts his financial situation. There was helplessness in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he is very clear, this is because he has been working for more than a month. If you extend the time to one year, more than one hundred pounds will still be able to Come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In two weeks, I have to tell Benson and Melissa that my salary is 3 pounds more, I can hire a maiden maid... so there is no Private money..." Kline wants to go to the main entrance of the underground trading market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he saw the old Neil wearing a black classical robe stepping slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All bought?" Old Neil laughed and said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Klein calmly replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Nielton snorted: "You are coming early."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is because I am still hungry, and you have already had dinner.” Klein snorted with the old Neil very casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the sinister bar owner Swein, wearing a naval officer’s uniform, came in from the outside, and his expression was close to the two, pressing down the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
