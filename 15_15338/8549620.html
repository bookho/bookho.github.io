			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the windowless basement, the rough and deep silhouette of Alger Wilson sits next to a long table with various utensils and sheepskin reels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of him, a half-burning candle stands, and the dim and dim flames illuminate the surrounding objects and the surface of the long table. Impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger’s hair is messy like a seaweed, dark blue and dark, wearing a robes embroidered with lightning patterns, hands clasped, opposite thumbs, leaning forward A bottle of dark liquid on the left side of the candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗! Oh! Oh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a whistling sound from the sealed bottle, and sometimes the sound of the sea slammed, and the dark liquid was not overwhelmed, the faint mist permeated. It seems as if the eyes and mouth are growing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger looked at the wall clock on the wall and saw that the hour hand was pointing at three points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pinched his temples, his eyes suddenly darkened, and the various utensils on the table also showed a subtle sheen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he found that the deep red radiance emerged, and emerged from the sky, drowning himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Queens, Hall home luxury villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending the dance teacher’s Audrey anti-locking door, he sat in front of the dressing table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window is bright and the flowers are bright, and a blank notebook bound with hazel exquisite parchment on the table is quietly spread out. On the right side, there is A pen with a golden tip and a red gemstone in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey tried it and decided that he would pick up the pen and record the recipe as soon as he got out of the "party." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really look forward to it..." She took a breath and pressed her excitement and looked at the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, she did not see the self reflected, only the deep red and illusory light from all around, from the body, at the same time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, the grandeur is like the temple of the giant king's residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long sides of the bronze long table are deep red and the fountains are rising and falling, and the two figures are blurred. They are in the same position as the last time. Compared to nothing, there is no change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde is supple, the tall Audrey instinct looks up, and I see the figure in the thick fog shrouded back, one hand flat, touch Touching the edge of the table, one hand holds the hand and squints at the chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Mr. fool!~" Audrey shouted softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she turned her head and looked at the opposite, speaking in the same tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ok, let’s hang up Mr.~!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This girl is really heartless, so I confirm that I am a good person, not afraid at all? Aristocratic girl who is well protected? Klein smiled and kept an inscrutable image: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon, 'Miss justice'."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he lowered his head slightly, raised his left hand with a virtual grip, and tapped twice in his eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sight, different moments, he saw the brilliance of the "justice" and "downside down" body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no change in the surrounding fog and deep red stars. There is nothing like a non-existent thing and a clear brilliance that seems to have a certain life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze is light, Klein only sees the "justice" gas field color is completely in line with the description of the old Neil, the red red, the purple purple, the The blue blue, the white white, and the bright luster, the right thickness, is a vibrant girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her emotions are red and yellow, happy, passionate, and exciting..." Kline made a judgment and turned his attention to "downside down." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Same as "Justice", the color of the inverted man's gas field is nothing special, but the mood is blue, mixed with a bit of orange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Calm, think, be cautious, and a little bit satisfied?" Klein was not too confident to go to the conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he was about to look away, he suddenly found a strange thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The innermost layer of the "downside down man", the color and feeling seem completely unified! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein condenses the spirit, carefully squats, and vaguely sees the "Ether Body" in the "upside down" is a dark blue color like sea water, giving people a gust of wind And the feeling of the tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His 'Star Spirit'? Or 'Star Spirit' surface? So, he is really extraordinary, and seems to be more than Old Neil. It’s going to be strong.” Kline’s thoughts are full of doubts. “It’s not necessarily, maybe it’s just because of this special environment, just because it’s my home, I can see it. It’s not that Old Neil has no similar performance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and looked at "justice", confirming that it was a special thing that extraordinary people would have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Alger also completed the greeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey took a breath and asked with implied expectation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' Hangman, sir, is the blood of the box of ghost sharks received?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger looked at Klein and saw him tapping his eyebrows as if thinking Something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you very much, it perfectly fits all my expectations. I really didn't expect you to send it so quickly, the blood of the ghost shark is not normal. Extraordinary things." Alger calmly replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey modestly smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very happy to see this result."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I love mysterious things since I was a child, she also made friends with the same hobbies in the aristocratic circles, exchanging information, books and rare items, but Before that, no one gained supernatural ability and became a real extraordinary. However, several princes have hinted that if she is willing to become a king, she will get the gift she wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this time the ghost shark blood was taken directly from the family treasure house. Anyway, the list is registered as a "big bottle", no ml is recorded. I didn't say that I was full, she believed that a little and a half of the one-and-a-half, I wouldn't have noticed that even if there was an accident, the parents would not be held accountable,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Alger looked at the fool in the fog and looked back. He smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the agreement, I will tell You 'the audience' the recipe for this potion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am ready, let's get started." Audrey took a breath and gathered All attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The low-sequence potions are very simple to prepare, and they are placed in the order given, but it must be remembered that the material is less likely to be used, not more That would be a big problem. You should have heard that the extraordinary people are out of control. Don't you repeat it again?" Alger first talked about the precautions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey nodded lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I fully understand."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, she looked at Mr. Fool’s side and wondered if the mysterious strongman had added it. Unfortunately, in her sight, the “fool” was quiet. Sitting there is like a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger thought about the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Less doesn't mean too much deviation... ...if you don't have a helper, I suggest taking the time to familiarize yourself with the chemistry experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a tutor in this area." Audrey answered without any burden. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
