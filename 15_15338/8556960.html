			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna’s body slammed back, the pupils contracted violently, the mouth opened halfway, and the screaming sound had reached the lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she hadn’t seen the “messeng” experience before, she would have been unable to control herself and stand up in horror, no matter whether the table or chair would fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the little girl who did not know anything about the sea when she first entered the White Onyx, the voice was only slightly pointed, pointing at the window Outside, stuttering and saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, there are living corpses!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No head Live corpse! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She uses the most common living corpse in folklore to describe the terrible thing she just saw.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Cecil brushed up and stood up, two steps to the side of Donna, looking out the window of the wind, carefully examined for a few seconds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing. She said truthfully.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna shrank back, braved her courage, carefully leaned forward, gathered together, saw the trees swaying outside, miscellaneous Nothing is flying, no pedestrians.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just, just now, he, he is wearing a black cloak, no head, his neck is bleeding! Donna said that she wanted to let the adults present believe in herself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her father, Uldi Blanche stood up at the table Go to the window and stare at it for a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Donna, I don't want to see the "Vifan West Horror Fiction Collection" tonight! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Donna grievances want to argue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is here At the time, Krivis went up to the second floor and came close:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Donna said she saw a living corpse outside, a living corpse without a head. Another bodyguard, Teague, explained with a chuckle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crivis silently for two seconds, and he nodded to Donna:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, it will pass." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The outside wind is very windy, more dangerous, wait for it to calm down, we will leave again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of Yu Tangna, Uncle Revis's words showed that he believed in himself and chose the safest solution. In the eyes of Uldi and Teague, this is a bad trick to comfort the child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Donna is still a little nervous, the real employer is not too satisfied, and Krivis sits down and sits down, calmly saying:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Banxi Port has a peculiar custom. Don't leave the house on a night of intense weather, don't respond to any percussion."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you open the door, you will be taken away by the living body?" Danden, who had seen the white bone messenger with his sister, asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be understood." Krivis took a white water and took a sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out to be the case... Donna settles down and believes that as long as she does not leave the restaurant, she will not encounter the horrible living corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, she discovered that the diners around had already cast their sights because of the movements here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonna, who was watched by a gaze, felt that the whole body was uncomfortable, and the instinct wanted to bury his head and avoid everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not done anything wrong! I really saw it! Donna barely straightened her neck and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw a gentleman wearing a swallowtail dress and a beautiful lady in a dress retracted her eyes and saw them lower their heads, picked up the spoon, and placed the porcelain bowl inside. Put a few dark red blood clots of spices into the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their lips were stained with blood red, and their faces were pale under the chandeliers of the crystal chandeliers. The contrast between the two made Tangna more inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is busy turning her head, waiting for dinner, and secretly praying to the goddess, hoping that the wind will stop as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banxi Port Telegraph Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan and the first officer just finished shooting the information to the Navy, and they found that the wind whistling outside, pulling the door and window near the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, the weather here is always so unstable." Elland wears a boat cap and sighs and laughs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His chief officer Harris Haha smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why else there will be 'weather Museum 'this title?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You better, don't go out, the legend will lose your head." Telegraph staff, a brown curly hair Miss slowly reminded me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, but I tried a few times and nothing happened." Harris did not care to pull the door away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerlan stopped him, thinking a little:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the church next to it Question?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your telegraph office should be closed, right? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem. "The lady with brown curly hair is still a slow-moving look.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerland nodded and opened the door of the telegraph office, against the roll-up of children. The wind blew, going to the storm church dozens of meters away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first officer Harris followed his captain and followed the captain’s body, seemingly wanting to express The idea of ​​directly rushing back to the White Onyx.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he opened his mouth, he was slammed into the mouth, and all the sounds were slammed back.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he wisely closed his mouth and no longer made obvious unrealistic offers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At this time, there is still a quarter of an hour from 7 o'clock. It can only be regarded as the evening. The gate of the Storm Church is still open and facing the believers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is coming here and becomes It's a lot softer, at least Airland and Harris don't have to worry about their hats abandoning themselves at any time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the church, finishing the darkness In the strict aisle, the two set foot in the big prayer hall and saw a man wearing a dark blue priest's gown sitting in the front row, quietly looking at the huge "storm emblem" composed of squally winds, waves, thunder and other symbols on the altar. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan laughed and walked over and took the familiar shoulder:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Jess, what is your bishop?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest’s head swayed after being photographed like this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next It slammed forward and slammed into the ground and made a continuous roll.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neck of the priest, the blood poured like a fountain, dripping Elland looked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of cold and wetness was introduced into the heart, and the bright red color blinded Elland’s eyes.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his sight, there is only a world of blood, and the head that finally stops rolling and his eyes are up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7:15, Klein and Daniz from the first-class restaurant found the swaying wind that had just blown the boat It has been a lot of peace.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for two seconds, Klein walked all the way to the entrance of the cabin and asked the crew members there:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who else hasn't returned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crew member saw the passenger and the captain enjoying the delicious fish and meat, did not hide: <br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to going to the Blanche family of the lime restaurant, the Dimudo family, other passengers came back before the wind, huh, huh, there is a long distance, and the meal time is longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, the captain and the chief officer went to the telegraph office and have not returned yet. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein couldn't see the dagger, and silence returned to Room 312.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood at the window On the side, looking at the waves that are blown by the wind, even if you don’t go to the mysterious space above the fog, you can faintly notice that something bad is brewing and happening. <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for another five minutes, he still did not see Captain Alan and the Donna family return.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Klein took a look at Daniz and let the famous pirates who were lying in the easy chair sit up straight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took back the sight, what? Did not say, walked into the bathroom.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He skillfully closed the door, paperr, camouflage, came to the fog, ready to do another divination Before he considered the potential risks of Banxi Port, he now intends to confirm the current level of danger.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ban Westport dangerous. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein holds the spirit and whispers the sentence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After and after, He opened his eyes and found that the citrine pendant was rotating clockwise, but the amplitude was not large and the speed was not fast.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was danger, but it was acceptable... ...this contradicts the previous revelation... Klein’s elbows are on the edge of the bronze long table, and he is suspicious.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly thought of a possibility, that The current danger is not equal to the hidden risk. Unless something is triggered or something is investigated in depth, the iceberg hidden under the sea level will be presented.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This hidden risk may have existed for three or four hundred years, or even longer, not because of my arrival... Well, the current danger may not even have anything to do with the hidden risks, but unfortunately, the lack of necessary information cannot Divination on this guess... After reading, Klein quickly returned to the real world and left the bathroom. The chair sat down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was silent, hesitating, and there was no movement for a long time, which made the "flame" Daniz feel uncomfortable.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Galman Sparo said that there is a hidden danger in Banxi, the famous pirate has been worried.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Can make this monster change the attention, the danger of not going to the lime restaurant, it must be terrible... How can I be so miserable on this holiday? It’s a bad haunt! Daniz is really sitting in a near-solid atmosphere. Live, I had to stand up and walk back and forth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw the monster of Spaler Sparrow suddenly stand up and buckled Button the long dress and walk to the coat rack at the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receive the half-high silk hat, Klein looks to the "flame", without expression Said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are free. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? "Daniz only feels that this is not true.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly understands what the other party wants to do, and suddenly blurs out:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You want to save the captain, and those ordinary people?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, you said that it is dangerous outside!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wears half height The silk topper, picking up the black hardwood cane and twisting the door handle, responded plainly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They worked with me.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
