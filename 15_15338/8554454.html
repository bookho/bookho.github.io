Covered with the hooded robes, the "eye of wisdom" went directly to Klein, the dark gold The brooch was handed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very mad... Klein just reached out and took care of it in the future, and it felt like the surrounding area had become hot, even the wind seemed to be burned by fire. Once, when inhaled into the nose, it spreads to the lungs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, he seems to have left the cold and wet Beckland, is in the desert and wilderness in the middle of the northern continent, the top is exuding infinite light and heat The sun is surrounded by flawless yellow sand that is dry to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, let me want to eat ice cream... Kline’s forehead slowly pulled out the sweat, but under the close of the iron mask, the liquids were not smooth. Falling down, you can only stick to the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With direct touch, he perceives the pure warmth of radiation radiating outwards, and the extraordinary people around him have no abnormalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After placing the brooch in the correct position, Klein diverges spirituality and immerses them in the dark gold surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hocking, he saw the pure golden light flying all over the sky and received a lot of information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes how to use some of the "sun" spells with the help of a brooch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus is on the spiritual input skills and the opening spells! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, to continue to provide spirituality for two seconds, the "brooch" will summon a sacred, falling light from the sky, purifying the necromantic creatures, and targeting other types of targets. Causes certain damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously providing spirituality for five seconds, and in conjunction with the word "sun" in ancient Hermes, can create a small amount of "sun holy water", which can drive away evil Spirit, drive away the cold, purify the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus the difference between strong and weak, the rest of the spells are correspondingly displayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Fire of Light" is a sacred and dense flame that produces gold in a vacuum. The "purification of the scorpion" is an effective blow against evil spirits and can be attached to On the bullet, "Immune Fear" can make the wearer no longer feel scared. The "Sacred Vow" is a momentary increase in power, agility, fire damage or holy damage by meditation on the corresponding ancient Hermes words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun Halo" is aimed at companions within 20 meters, which can effectively enhance their courage and purify the evil forces in their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels good, except that it’s not surprising enough, there aren’t too many flaws, and my “magician” ability is just complementary... It’s hot... Klein’s mind The inner fantasy is all about the short sleeves of your own shorts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rolled up his robes and took a stack of banknotes from the inside pocket, plus the lady who was just from the back of the "artisan" For the 900 pounds, I paid a total of 2,000 pounds of cash to the waiter of "The Eye of Wisdom". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Counted three times, and finally confirmed that Klein looked at the "wallet" that quickly went down, and the mood was both joyful and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His hard-earned money has only 574 pounds and 5 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he also harvested his second magical item, with side effects significantly less than the "master key", the more outstanding magical item, "sun brooch" ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too hot... Klein reached out and touched the iron mask and almost took it off the fan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of the banknote returned to him in the past, no longer considering buying other items, sitting quietly there, and hearing the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the spur of the £2,000 big deal, the party tonight is relatively active, for example, the whip woven from the feathers of the sacred sunbirds sold out. 850 pounds, such as the "eye of wisdom" shot in succession, bought an ancient book, an extraordinary material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the first to leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is afraid that I will be robbed... Klein sincerely thanked, under the guidance of the waiter, walked out In the living room, I couldn’t wait to take off my robes with hoods and took off the iron mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has just tried, using spiritual wrapping and blockade, can isolate the "sun brooch" from uninterrupted purification, avoiding its existence and being discovered by the rest of the extraordinary But the negative effects can't be weakened unless they are not taken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure my mental health, I will use it later when I need it. It is enough to rely on "purifying bullets" and "exorting bullets"... Klein left The meeting place, around a big circle, came outside the brave bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He entered a circle and soon walked out again and hired a carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, he quickly saw a figure in the opposite position of the black court dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon’s appearance has not changed, she whispered in a whisper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you can pick the ambush location and time, and let me know when you are sure." Klein calmly nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon looked at him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that she is about to disappear, Klein added another sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let Casper prepare a box of explosives, scattered Buried in different places on the battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon silently for two seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Steve is also a blasting expert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, my main purpose is not to blow anyone." Klein smiled. "I just want to put fireworks." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon looked at him quietly for a few seconds, and finally just nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing her figure fly fast, Klein leaned against the wall and opened the window, letting the bones of the outside blow into the cold wind However, he still feels very hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hate summer most when I am on earth, um, I like popsicles, ice cream, cold drinks, watermelon... Klein squats and puts his hand in The pocket, holding the "sun brooch". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a magical item worth £2,000! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Minsk Street, Klein walked slowly along the trees on both sides of the road to the house on the 15th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lugergen was at the lawyer's house, he subconsciously looked into his eyes and saw the gas lamp with a little blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is... Klein smiled and sighed, his forehead was sweating constantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Thursday morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just took the newspaper out of the bathroom and heard the sound of the doorbell being rattled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who? By the way, Tallim mentioned, reporter Mike Joseph will come to me today... In the slamming movement, Klein came to the door and reached out to grasp the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image of the visitor has naturally appeared in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty years old Black coat, half-high hat, same eyebrows, blue eyes, two beautiful mustaches, but the skin is quite rough, it is the daily observation reporter Mike Joseph. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "sun brooch" was undoubtedly thrown into the fog by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike Joseph pulled the bow tie:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, bother you so early, I There are other things waiting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Klein said with a politeness, "Is it used for breakfast? Would you like to taste my roast?" Secretary?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike suddenly smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really embarrassing." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can have a cup of hot coffee, milk is fine, I think you have ordered fresh milk."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...OK." Klein followed with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was busy baking the toast, poured the milk, took out the cream tin can, then sat down and ate half to nothing. full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite Mike was enjoying the breakfast without any restrictions, and was unaware of the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein breathed a sigh of relief and put down the cup:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mike, you want Hire me to protect you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike slowly cuts the knife and fork and drank milk:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, about two days, Friday and Saturday, and maybe Sunday morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who wants to hurt you?" Klein considered Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike Hehe smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is an active self-protection. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The editor-in-chief of the newspaper arranged for me to go to the Eastern District, the Docklands and the factory area to do a survey of the news, which is said to have been funded by a church or a noble. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, the Eastern gangsters are rampant, there are villains everywhere, or people who are willing to sell their conscience for a bite, I need a good at fighting." "The protector of the shooting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, most private detectives have certain connections in the Eastern District, aren't they?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't have...I rely on metaphysics, no, reasoning! Klein thought for a moment: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I don't necessarily have time in these days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to wait for the action of Miss Sharon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike is busy clearing his throat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have applied for it, £10, This protection task totaled £10, even if nothing happened.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mike, I am serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will be at this point tomorrow, um, after breakfast, find me, if I have free time, I will After taking this commission, if it is really busy, I will introduce you to another detective, who is also good at fighting and shooting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as Stuart For example, Kaslana...has already flashed two names in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike eats the remaining toast:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After breakfast, Klein watched the journalist leave his home and admire the puffy rain outside, the carriages coming and going through the glass in the belly window. Pedestrians, admiring the darkness of the sky and an umbrella with different colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
