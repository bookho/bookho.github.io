			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of Silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick Berg didn't know how he got home, just remembering the inexplicable fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The character and performance of Dirk Riggins is not much different from the past, but it does have a disturbing change, Dairik I am afraid that Baiyincheng will be stared by the evil god "fallen creator", fearing that he has not yet become a "sun", saving the silver city from the curse of more than two thousand years, giving the residents here hope and sunshine, it has been thoroughly destroy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he hates that he is not strong enough, only the sequence 8. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! Can't look at it like this! Dairik Huo Ran stood up, ready to rush to the round tower, told the other six elders of the "six people's parliamentary group" and told the "chief" Colin Iliad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Dairik is very clear that similar anomalies are simply not doubtful. Every time you explore the depths of darkness, there will be a few days with the members. Ten days, even more than a month of high tension, it is a monster that may encounter strong or strange at any time and anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the ridiculous and inexpressible journey without human smoke will bring extreme repression, and for the sake of safety, the members of the exploration team will not be in the outing stage. Being allowed to have sexual venting, which allows them to experience a certain re-construction every time they experiencing exploration. If they encounter the great danger of the death and injury of the squad members, the rest of the characters are not too rare. Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treatment of such people is only routinely isolated and treated, with few exceptions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The Silver City has the first three sequences of the “Dragon” approach, so there is no shortage of “psychologists”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derrick rushed to the door and suddenly slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that it is very likely that there will be no effect in finding a report of the "six-member parliamentary group". There is a chance that it will attract doubts and even be "shepherd" Luo Wei. The danger of the elders staring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dozen seconds, Deric bit his teeth and pulled out the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that he must remind the elders of the "six-member parliamentary group", even if they will bear no small risk! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the vast majority of residents of Silver City, the sacrifice to maintain the existence of the city, to maintain the continuation of this civilization, is inscribed in the bone marrow Faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selfish people often do not live long in such internal and external environments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Dairik is not completely reckless. Under the words and deeds of the members of the Tarot Club, especially the "downside down", he clearly understands certain times. To understand patience, it is necessary to properly protect themselves and not to make unnecessary sacrifices. This is to better guard the Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just said that the anomaly I observed should be no danger... Dairik himself comforted and ran more and more urgently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he saw the round tower that symbolizes the highest power of Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found the extraordinary person who is here to pay, and made a request to meet the "chief". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Dairik unexpected is that the extraordinary person did not ask why, as usual, after a simple pass, he took him along the ladder On, arrived at the room belonging to the "chief". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s weird...not the same as before... Dairik feels that this change in detail makes him even more uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the room, he saw the "chief" Colin Iliat standing in front of a wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decree is very deep, blue sorrow, white-haired messy tall old man with two straight swords hanging across the wall, wearing the usual A linen shirt and a brown jacket are hard to believe. He is a strong man who has hunted many demons and monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chief lord." Dairik took a gift. "I met a team that explored the temple at the training ground today. I, I found that Dak Rikins I know has a strange change, he is no longer as before. Cheerful, his smile is as polite as a stranger, and Elder Loyya is no longer changing the state of speech."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keulin I took a deep look at Dairik and asked: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only these two things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes, yes." Dairik lowered his head. "I think this may be abnormal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin waved: < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, I will let Evlo go for the inspection, you go back, and this kind of thing will be reported directly to the guards of the round tower." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aphrod is the most senior "spiritual analyst" in Silver City, closest to Sequence 6. Unfortunately, there is no potion recipe after Sequence 7. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting such a reply, Dairik left in depression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin looked at his back and disappeared at the door, and suddenly sighed with disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Dr. Allen exchanged a moment with Will. After the situation, Klein did not find additional horses in the middle of the carriage, take the steam subway, arrived at Minsk Street after the three-station road, and changed to a trackless public carriage to return home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the time is still early, he first used divination to confirm that the previous tenant did not lie, and then diligently continued to learn the book of Secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this book of occultism, from entry to proficiency, Klein’s use of the mysterious space above the fog is becoming more and more clever. A lot of excellent operations have been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now what limits me is its own sequence, its own strength and spirituality." At night, Klein hid the "Book of Secrets" with a side Go to the bathroom to clean yourself and get ready to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, he slept very well, even if the church bells in the early morning, just let him turn over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter is suitable for being in the bed... Klein muttered to get up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to slap the "Black Emperor", his breakfast was filled with sugared boiled eggs and strawberry jam specially bought for white bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorbell suddenly sounded when he was enjoying the food leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't tell Mike, let him be after breakfast?" Klein groaned, drank a sweet soup and wiped it with a napkin. Wipe your mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his agreement with reporter Mike, the other party will arrive half an hour after breakfast to open an interview with the rescued Eastern District girls, if Mike is more than half The hour has not yet appeared, indicating that things will be postponed for one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein went to the door and did not reach out. The mind naturally outlined the visitors outside. He was not a Mike Joseph reporter, but Allen. Dr. Kreis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Allen, did you sleep late yesterday?" Klein found Allen's face so bad that he quietly opened his mind and glanced at it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allen took off his hat and put his cane. He was about to take off his coat, but he was discouraged by the cold air in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein laughed two channels:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going out today, you know, Mike may come to me, so I didn't get the fireplace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen nodded, not much to say, followed Klein into the living room, looking for a Sit down and speak:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nightmare? This is within my knowledge... Dreaming is professional, more professional than reasoning... Klein leans forward and hands on both sides:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of nightmare?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen recalled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some details and processes I can't remember it. What impressed me the most was a dark towering spire with a silver-white serpent, which was slowly squirming, looking at me with cold, ruthless red eyes.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know why, I entered the minaret, went up the stairs, and sometimes went down, passing through one wall after another, passing through one fan. Tightly locked door, eventually, I found the child named Will. Anthony in a dark corner. He jumped a few steps on one leg and curled up against the wall, sprinkling the tarot card around him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Seeing is me, he is scared and happy, and shouted 'Doctor Allen'... The whole dream is almost like this, then I woke up. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened carefully and thought, asking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will. Didn’t Ting say anything else?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan frowned for a while and suddenly blurted out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, he said, Dr. Allen, there is a snake who wants to eat me!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then, the silver-white giant snake hangs upside down from the ceiling The head is facing me...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has a large mouth, but there are no teeth, no tongue, a blood red!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver-white serpent...the dark tower...Wil.Ansettin under the layers of defense...Klein considers Dr. Allen:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a strange dream, it should be you and Wei When Anthony communicated, he unconsciously realized that he was in a certain predicament and was threatened by something, so he would dream of a similar scene: hiding in the depths of the tower, hiding behind countless walls and gates. The child, the silver-white giant snake coiled around the top of the tower...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, as a detective, more or less understand a little psychology, in the newspaper There are often introductions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What makes me puzzled is, why didn't you dream like this until today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Klein did not lie in the interpretation, but did not talk about the possible real reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan opened his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was too anxious, forgot one piece "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he pulled out the leather wallet and took out a hand-made good paper crane from the inside:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After discovering that the Will. Anthony family had moved away, I remembered that he sent me this thing before leaving the hospital, saying, doctor, this can bring you Good luck.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't care at the time, I threw it in the drawer of the office, and I got it back after you separated it from you last night. Put it in the wallet, and as a result, I had the nightmare of the night. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the paper cranes and thought of it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dr. Allen, it seems that Will. Anthony does not intend to make you unlucky. He has made up for it afterwards. The thousand paper cranes invented by Russell’s emperor have the meaning of giving good wishes, and he also said that this will give You bring good luck. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen subconsciously asks: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thousands of paper cranes are Russell Invented by the Great? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know if it is him, but I think it should be him... Klein ups and downs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
