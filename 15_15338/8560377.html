			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third part is called "Traveller", so the style I booked is easy, and the structure is very simple, just as I said before, one People stop and go, see some scenery, meet some people, and do some things, but they are not involved deeply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, the content of this kind of swaying is still somewhat difficult to write. It’s hard to shape a character, get familiar with a place, and have a sense of customs. I have to leave, continue to embark on the journey, and test the ability to quickly introduce characteristic characters and interesting events. Now think about it. Before Xiaoke was promoted to the "Master of Secrets", I still did a good job, and then I was busy with the button. There are too many things to write, and basically revisiting the place, it is omitted, and it is relatively urgent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a lot of people say that my outline is very detailed. Actually, there is nothing. I have detailed settings. The outline is often what this theme is. What structure should be written, which lines will be pulled in front, what new foreshadowing needs to be set, which suspense will be unfolded, and then free to play, the end of a story is the outline of the next story, so hundreds of thousands of words Content, you must think about each plot in advance, not only wasting time, but also very dull, because you don’t really write it out, you really can’t know how the story is going, how to pick it up later, and often on the way to writing. New inspiration bursts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I wrote a story that ended with a small gram leaving Beckland, there was a picture and a finishing touch that ended in the undercurrent The pen also has a reservation for the brother and sister to play. At the same time, when the outline is compiled, there is also a mark in the world of the book, but relative to the end, there is no more specific, and later, the release of the "nightmare" "Because he had brought words to his daughter for him, he showed another inspiration for the end of the trip, wrote "Grossel Travels", began to set the specific characters in the book, and when he got a Lun soldier, he suddenly With the inspiration of homesickness, these are added together, and I am very clear about how to write the third part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third part of the overall flatness, which is determined by its own structure and predetermined style, I also said in advance, want to see friends who have a big event at the end It may be a bit disappointing. As I just said, what I am going to end up is a feeling of undercurrent and turbulent crisis, including the appearance of Ins, including the maliciousness of the desire mother tree and the attack of the rose school. To set off the picture of Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the third part is that the front is difficult to write, and the second is to write two copies, the ruins of the gods and the world of books, this is for me. In terms of it, it is a considerable test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends who have read the novels in front of me should know that the passages of the copy and the copy of the Arcane can be said to be relatively dry, rough, not too attractive. Force, the former is strong at the end of the copy, the latter, I seriously thought about it, probably the analysis of the copy of the dream and the new world bragging God's forced part of the paragraph is more interesting, the other is not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the world, many copies have expanded into a world with the help of an infinite stream architecture, which can be slowly written, introduced, paved, and often have companions In comparison, the attraction is much higher, but a few copies, such as the real suspicion, still have problems with dry and rough, relying on suspense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The martial arts basically have no copy, there is a section in the war area, there are not many, there is nothing to sum up, when I came to the secret third part, I seriously think How to deal with these two big copies for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the experience of the first world, I first set the two points of "suspense" and "companion". According to the experience before and during the writing, I also made "interesting". "This, but always feel that it is still a little worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, I remembered that when I was chatting with beans, I found that the creative methods of the two of us were different. I wanted to talk about such a story and a worldview before I According to the story and background, I will finalize a few more important characters, and then slowly add new ones. He first thinks about some interesting people, and then decides what kind of stories these people will meet, peers, and grievances. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have been sticking to my creative ideas, I am slowly incorporating some of his experiences, so I am thinking, can I put in the copy? “Peer” is changed to “People” to shape some interesting people, let them collide together, unfold some stories, enrich the content of the copy, make it more attractive overall, and then have the relics of the gods. try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is not bad, this is when I write a copy, the first time I have not only failed to drop, but has been rising, close to 100,000 words, always Very interesting to write down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the book world, I made another attempt, because the first exploration of this copy will be short-lived, it is impossible to expand the past of the characters inside, It is impossible to express their sorrow and joy with great appeal, so I am thinking about how to express the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
