Clot the ice floes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "living body" mastery of the power of frost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the blood is getting stiff, Trey no longer hesitates and resists a punch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her lips turned white and her mouth opened slightly, giving an invisible scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this scream, a dark blue illusion aura emerges from the inside of her body. Wherever it passes, the frost condenses and layers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a second or two, she and Klein have been inside the frozen world, surrounded by thick transparent ice, covered with soft Hoarfrost, the two seem to be very close, but they need to break through the obstacles before they can meet again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trea's bright and charming face showed a smile, and the body burned a quiet black flame from the inside out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They quickly melted around the frost, as a counterattack for the "disease girl", opened the way for her to take the initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, she saw Yilian’s expression, which was often weak and not strong enough, and made a snap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An unnoticed match ignited, the red flames leaped and instantly covered the figure of the red-haired dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tre's pupils shrink, spiritual intuition has a very bad premonition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quiet black flame behind her, Klein, who is still Elaine-like, jumped out and stretched out her arms, embracing the "disease girl" Thunder, her arms are firmly locked in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he opened his mouth and made a sound:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible air blasting, power over the revolver, comparable to the latest rifle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It crossed the void and accurately hit Trey's back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet opened the skull and drilled in, but the figure of "the disease" was shrunk and turned into a black rod that was interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Magic Wand Alternative Method"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trey 茜 quickly appeared diagonally opposite, the shirt button fell off, revealing the snowy and seductive scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it’s not this that attracts Kline’s attention, but the blood of the other’s palms! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Klein banned Trey, he was also clawed by the other's palm, pulling off a piece of clothing and scratching his thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Trey's mouth quickly closed two times, and the palm of the hand suddenly emerged an illusory black flame, burning the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is black magic, this is the witch's curse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s figure trembles uncontrollably, from inside to outside, from the soles of the feet to the top of the head, while the black flames are burning, and the whole person quickly turns into confetti. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just stood out in another corner, and he felt that there were countless invisible spider silks around him, some hard, trying to bind, some soft, provocative With different parts of the body, Klein's extraordinary people who are extremely calm in the battle are quick-hearted, their ears are hot, their bodies are slightly numb, and they have both cold-like discomfort and impulsive impulses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turray’s ability on the spider silk is terrible compared to the Mrs. Shelen’s wife in Tingen City! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not dare to neglect, immediately snapped a finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the nearby spider silks were all ignited, the red flames extended in the opposite direction, and the tide surged into the "sickness of the disease" Trey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Tingen, Klein knew that the spider of "Happy Witch" was afraid of fire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the central area of ​​the room became a huge spider web that was ignited, and Trey was caught off guard, and was swept by the scorching heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" She exhaled in her nose, and there was a faint blue illusion in the body, which sealed herself in a transparent and huge lens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red flames rushed in, allowing the outer layer of ice to melt and become weaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t go to the bracelet with diamonds in it, because it’s not clear what negative effect the gadget had. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurrying to use magical items without knowing enough, for itself, the high probability is a hazard, not a boost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He straightens his body, opens his arms, and the gloves of his left palm are stained with the color of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Priest of Light!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Trey in the ice trap only knows that Elaine, who is familiar with the extreme, has a little more sacred brilliance than usual, and the eyebrows are filled with unprecedented The perseverance, beauty is no longer weak, more like a blooming sun flower, a flower covered with blood on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trey's voice shouted a little hoarsely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you dare to show your true look! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of wearing a skirt, it is more appropriate to use your own appearance, or it is more suitable for Elaine... Kline’s mood is divorced, and his thoughts are flashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he praised the sun.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bright and clear light column fell out of thin air, The golden flame is entwined, and the ice cubes are completely covered with the Trey.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice layer dissolves at a speed visible to the naked eye, disappears, and the splendid light shines with It is faint and disintegrated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sacred Light" restrains the dead spirit and filth, and the witch can only count as a normal sequence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry twirled and escaped the air bullets that Klein shot, and the holes on the carpet were one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning, Trey’s figure disappeared and disappeared into the enemy’s sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stealth of the witch...Klein is slightly bent, highly vigilant, and uses his inspiration and the dangerous premonition of the "clown" to find Trey Trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for a short while, he couldn’t find anything, and his forehead was getting hotter, his lungs were like a fire, his throat was sore and itchy, Can not help but cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no more delays! Klein's thoughts turned, and suddenly he smiled and changed to a blunt male voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ilan told me your secrets.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also told me all about her own secrets..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s voice is not falling, inspiration There was a trigger, because there was a strong mood swing in a corner, and the anger and hatred was hard to conceal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately turned his body and looked at the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gloves of his left palm instantly appeared in layers of golden scales, and his eyes were stained with light gold, as if they were erected.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uninterrupted, Trey’s figure is sketchy and his expression is painful and distorted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a lot Feminine black curly hair grows wildly and spreads around.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Psychologist" "Frenzy"!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotions are mobilized In the face of such an attack, the Thunder suddenly collapsed and lost his senses for a short time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein seized the opportunity and slammed his finger.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air bullet flew the distance between the two, and went straight to Trey, even if it was twisted and still beautiful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly A sturdy black hair swept over, the air bullet changed direction, and slammed on Trey's left shoulder, hitting her shirt broken, flesh and blood splashing, white bones exposed.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry screamed with screams, and the black flames in the body poured out inexhaustibly, completely covering her.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the black flame condensed thick ice crystals outside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside, the crazy growing UFA Rewinding, layering, and wrapping the Trey, Black Flame and Ice Crystals, it seems to weave a huge cocoon made up of human hair.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰!砰!砰!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s air bullets are shot in succession, but they can only penetrate the black hair and get trapped in the middle of the ice crystal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and let the left palm glove glow with the sun.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, his throat was itchy, It’s hard to control anymore, coughing up sharply, and the prepared attack failed to do so.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Thunder in the black silkworm cocoon has recovered his mind and raised his voice. , sharply shouted:<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, Klein stunned for a second, daytime As if returning to Beckland, when he returned to the first time he met the devil's dog, he knew that he could not fight. He could only scream "killing" and "helping him", and fleeing wildly, finally succeeded in getting rid of the danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
