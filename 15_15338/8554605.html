			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...in such a strange silence, the first thought of the returning Dairik. Berg flash is to save people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the two guards who held him in the middle did not react, it seems that everything just happened is his auditory hallucination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are people asking for help." Juvenile Dairik reminded the two Dawn Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on his left, the tall knight wearing silver full body armor responded calmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Do not be fooled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is just the normal performance of some extraordinary people who are out of control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Yes? Maybe he just didn't want to give up, and lost control became a monster, so he screamed for help... Dairiky thought sadly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his emotional changes, the illusion of the ear is evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a few more steps before the silence. The Dawn Knight pointed to the door on the left:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You live here during this time, we will deliver food and medicine on time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he took out An iron black vial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bottle is woven from the straw-like things left by the black-and-white staple food of Silver City. When it encounters liquid, it will produce a film to achieve a waterproof seal. The effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick took the bottle of medicine and drank it down, only to feel a cool gliding across the esophagus and into the stomach pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole person quickly became calm, the scene shaking in front of him was returning to a steady state, and the auditory hallucinations in the ear gradually weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sound of the iron gate closing and unlocking, Dairik entered the room of his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing he saw was a candle swaying with dim light, and then he identified the bed, chair and square table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, there is nothing else, but the walls, including the doors, are engraved with complex and mysterious symbols and logos that seem to make up A complete seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek’s emotions were also suppressed by the potion, and he sat down without a curiosity and lay down on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, he suddenly heard the screaming screams, but it was not from his room, but from the next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric turned up and listened carefully, and heard the sharp, sorrowful weeping in the sound of the collision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hair shook violently, and the whole person stood up fiercely and put on a very defensive posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sound of the cockroach spread to the metal wall separating the two rooms, and the convex squats were pulled out one after another. Start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick is about to pray for the light, and suddenly his eyes are bright, and his space seems to have all been moved to the outside world, and it is like lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the wall next door disappeared and the bottom of the round tower returned to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not absolutely quiet, but a slight footstep can sway far and far, and it will be quiet for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick is guessing what happened to the extraordinary person next door, and the metal wall on the other side has been ringed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;笃笃笃! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems as if someone has bent his fingers and gently tapped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Dairik asked loudly and asked with a slight horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knocking sound immediately stopped, and after a few seconds, a thick but rather old voice was vaguely passed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be a young age. Little guy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You?” Dairik saw the other person communicating sensibly, slamming the wall and covering the cold metal with his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old voice screamed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The one next to you was almost out of control I finally couldn’t save it today.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s completely out of control? Dairik asked through the metal wall: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So he is now a monster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No, not a monster, a dead body, he has been sealed by the items here." The old voice sighed. "I have been here for forty-two years, um, those guards told me, I have seen Too many similar things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric is quite surprised to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You have been here for forty-two years?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, out of control can be divided into three stages, one is the emergence of precursors, such as auditory hallucinations and illusions Vision, the second is that the body and spirit have been somewhat uncontrollable, from time to time will show a state of terrible or strange, and the third is a complete collapse, a monster that is turned into horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, from the second stage to the third stage is quite fast, maybe just discovered, you will see a seemingly normal extraordinary person become dark and deep monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, after the extraordinary person in the second stage is sent to the bottom of the round tower, it will be stabilized by treatments such as pharmacy and rituals. Leaving here within a year and a half, or soon will be out of control, cleared and purified, no one can be locked here for forty-two years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary person in the first stage may only need a few days, ten days, to eliminate the precursors and heal away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old voice suddenly laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I didn't think of me I will stay here for forty-two years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have any signs of getting out of control, they think I am quite dangerous and can become a monster at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick slightly frowned, curiously asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened four or two years ago? What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, his parents were still not born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the old man silently said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I used to be a captain of the exploration team." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We found a destroyed city half a month away from Silver City, oh, this is calculated at our speed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The city is similar to our silver city, with obvious traces of the rule of the giants, and believes in the creation of all the Lord, the omnipotent God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, they were destroyed and destroyed for a few years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar things, Derry G is no stranger, immediately guessed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have encountered some weird things there, so you are considered to be out of control at any time?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost." The old voice snorted. "After we explored the core area, we found that the city was trying to change its faith and shaped it. Some of the gods they imagined to save them, however, this is of no use, even the statues of the gods are destroyed and spilled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When it comes to this, his tone suddenly becomes condensed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, however, we met someone there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the first living we have met in Silver City for more than two thousand years that does not belong to our city-state!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beside Silver City, In the depths of the endless darkness, there are still people alive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick asked subconsciously:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You brought him back to Silver City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old voice was separated by two seconds:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not feel the vibration?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our Silver City strives to explore the surroundings just to find the same human beings as us. It was finally discovered forty-two years ago!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed quite shocking news, but I often see Miss Justice, "pour Hang people, "Mr. They often hear about the kingdom of Lun and the seven gods, there are people outside the Silver City, as well as city-states, and the country, is it not a very obvious fact?" Dairik scratched his head and pretended to have a shocked tone without any experience:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I just didn't notice this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really incredible, except for the residents of Silver City, there are still other people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... "The old voice was silent for a while. "Is the education in Silver City so bad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited for Dairik to speak, he sighed Self-satisfaction: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are very alert to invite that person to visit the Silver City. After he considered it, he agreed."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We monitored and escorted him back along the road, but when he arrived in Silver City, he suddenly disappeared..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We searched around and couldn't find him. After returning to Silver City, my team members went crazy one by one, out of control, all! All!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "The six-member panel suspects that we are all polluted by something. I suspect that the person is not a human being at all, but an evil spirit. It is a monster. So, shut me up here, and confirm me every once in a while. The state, but never tells me where the problem is, and does not let me go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick spit a heavy breath:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you still remember that person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...He looks ordinary, has no features, Wearing is similar to us, except that I remember that he is a male, I can't think of his appearance... But the elders should be able to see him directly from my vaguely forgotten memories with extraordinary means." The old voice recalled For a few tens of seconds, said a little bit of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick followed up with a question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So he said what he called? Have you exchanged his origins with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old voice "Hmm" gave a voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "He told us that he called..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Amon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunday morning, factory area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days before, Klein and Mike, under the guidance of Old Kohler, "visited" many places in the Eastern District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike thus saw five or six people crammed into a room, and this is not the worst case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poorest places in the Eastern District, an ordinary bedroom can even sleep ten people, the ground floor, the right to use the day, the right to use at night, etc. The gentleman was amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, poverty does not discriminate between men and women. Those places, people of different genders are hard to avoid, and some things that go to court are everywhere. Whether men or women, they are always facing the threat of violence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
