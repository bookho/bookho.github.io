			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting the pen in his hand, Klein untied the spirit in the left wrist cuff, holding it in one hand, hanging over the paper, almost touching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Edwina is in the story of this book." Klein closed his eyes and meditated on divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven times, he opened his eyes and saw the citrine pendant spinning in a clockwise direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is affirmative, saying that "Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina is in the book "Grossel Travels"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really the world in the book...and the state inside should be very special, no newcomers to join, the story can’t turn pages...Klein’s invisible location Next, re-wrapp the silver chain with the citrine pendant and pick up the dark red round pen next to it and write a new divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The way to enter the "Grossel Travels"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he used the "dream divination", in the gray world, see A blurred figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures are huge, some slender, and the common feature is that they are all holding a book made of yellow-brown parchment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two different situations in the next development, some of which have been carrying the "Grossel Travels" silently disappeared, and some Sometimes when you pick up the book and put it aside, the figure suddenly disappears after accidentally or actively dropping blood into the cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture is broken, Klein stares at the mottled long table in front, and frowns and interprets:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To enter or open the "Grossel Travels", either long-term contact, reach a limit, or drop your own blood on the cover?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is this too simple? Maybe... It’s so simple. The Ron soldier in the story is just an ordinary person when he’s on the scene. He doesn’t even know occultism. With the help of his companions, he grows into a 'disciplined knight’ step by step... So, open the way. Not complicated, most people can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A small number of former researchers, including 'Iceberg Lieutenant' Edwina, are extraordinary people with enough occult knowledge, clearly can't take I don’t know how to die in my own blood. This is just like the ordinary people using the effective 'magic mirror divination method'. It is very easy to provoke a strong unknown and hidden existence, so they have no problem. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adding to Edwina most of the time, "Grossel Travels" is placed in the collection room, occasionally contact, so until She recently had a new research idea, and after a long-term touch, did the book reach the conditions for opening? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, even the 'mirror' Arrods only knows that this book is weird, and the masters have been missing, suspected to be with the dragons and 'The City of Miracles' is related to Levished. This shows that when Grosser Travels is opened, it will interfere with the surrounding environment and erase the corresponding clues. Therefore, most of its collectors in the past are not clear about it. The problem, there is no research idea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The missing masters should not only be the few in the story, the rest may have died of various problems, failed to Leave a name in the travel note..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein regained his thoughts and made another divination, hoping to get away from the Grosser Travels.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he saw a more violent blizzard in the gray dream world, and saw a huge figure standing on the top of the ice peak.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a translucent dragon with four feet standing still close to five meters. It’s like a close relative of a lizard with an ugly face. The blue eyes and the thick and powerful tail, with a pair of huge wings covering the membrane behind them, just unfolding, there is a feeling of covering the sky.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Its scales are like ice crystals, and the shimmering shimmer is the most beautiful and dreamy place on the whole body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, this frost is carved like The dragon raised his neck and body and made a terrible encounter that penetrated the blizzard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"King of the North"... The Frost Dragon... Klein got out of the dream and tapped the handrail of the high back chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His interpretation of the divination of the divination is:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the "Grossel Travels" The key is the "King of the North"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein initially suspected that it was necessary to kill this frosty dragon and let the main character of Grosser achieve the goal, so that the story would be "end" and open. The passage of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, you can also try to force the break between the world of the book and the real world... Klein relies on a wealth of experience and soon has the idea of ​​trying . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first picked up the "Black Emperor" on the right hand side and integrated it into his own spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, Klein's body covered with black full body armor, a heavy crown on the top of the head, the atmosphere became noble and majestic, people dare not Direct view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he swayed the power of this mysterious space above the fog to the maximum, letting them flow like water, surging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Klein did not hesitate and waved through the "Poseidon Scepter" in the heap of debris to infuse his own spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cyan gems at the top of the white bones are lit one after another, giving off dazzling brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The innumerable silver and white lightnings emerged, hovering in the magnificent palace, Netz, as if forming a thunderous ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, with the suppression and balance of the "Black Emperor" personality, Klein put all the power of the incitement into the storm of lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunder is swaying above the fog, going straight into the distance, a thick flash of lightning or falling or falling at the same time, lingering in Grosse Travel Notes is on the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glamorous brilliance enveloped the entire palace and lasted for twenty seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything subsided, Klein looked at the target again and found that the mottled long table was ruined, and the dark brown book was intact, only the corners There are rolls up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than I imagined... Also, can create a book in the world of the world, which is simple... Oh, the previous 8,000 pounds to buy absolutely no loss Ah, it can be used as a shield. It can definitely block at least the holy-level attack. The only problem is that the area is too small and the coverage is not enough... Klein’s thoughts flashed, and the bronze long table quickly recovered. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there is no way to forcefully penetrate the "barrier" of the world of the book and the real world, he can only begin to consider how to enter in the normal way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get some blood out first, then bring it here, wipe it onto the cover, and use the spirit to match the 'Black Emperor' and 'Poseidon' to enter? This does not have to worry about encountering the 'King of the Five Seas' Nast, because he can't feel it, and can't enter the book world, but the problem is that after she rescued the 'Iceberg Lieutenant', she can be sure of the Germans. Paro is the Grand Theft Auto 'Black Emperor'...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, there is one of the most important issues. Entering with the spirit means the flesh is outside, in the ' The captain of the Golden Dream's interior, and I don't know the time flow of the world in the book, it is easy to go for a few days, in that case, the body will accidentally encounter accidents, after all, lack of protection, and in strange places, At that time, I rescued Edwina, but found that 'self' was gone, and the jokes opened up. "Klein quickly denied the idea of ​​spiritual entry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not too trusting most of the "Golden Dream", the strongest hunter Anderson is also wary.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After trying to divinate and enter the book to save people, there is no danger, but after failing, Klein meditates for a while and returns. In the real world, then, without hesitation, he took back Grosser's Travels and dealt with the residual traces of the ritual.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
