			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a while, Klein, who had no answer, had no dangerous hunch, and he took up the slender blood crystal, then bent down and examined the loss. Half-headed and demonized Gilthias. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if I can get a reward, how much can I get... I don't know who the military contact person is here? Take a telegram to Us Kent? This time, plus the time of his remote operation, no three or four days will definitely be bad, I have to leave tomorrow... and, inevitably, to the middleman." He sipped a few words, go On one side, I picked up a half-height silk hat with obvious scorch marks and put it on my head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he dragged the heavy and huge demon corpse, step by step to the door, and stretched out the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind screamed in, and the silence in the house disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein licks his finger off the "line of the spirit" and continues to drag the horrible demon corpse, through the corridor, down the stairs, down to the first floor . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there are no more people left in the bar, the table is turned over, the pieces are scattered, and the whole place is full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein entered the hall through a severely broken staircase, looked around and found the boss who was squinting and squeezing behind the bar – there were few bodyguards he hired. Position, scattered around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒,哒,哒... Klein stepped over and the demon corpse behind him smashed a lot of tables and chairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, what do you want to do?" The boss stepped back and asked with a scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His bodyguards gathered together in a treacherous manner, their eyes drifting, their bodies are different, and it seems that once an accident occurs, they will immediately rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stopped and took Gilci's body to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he was dumb and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you get a bounty?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss stayed for a second, his instinct moved down, and he saw the huge demon corpse still entwined with a little blue flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and his bodyguards took a sigh of relief at the same time, with an illusion that they are not in the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This turned out to be a real demon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is exactly the same as the demons described in the church books and legends except for the uncut goat horns! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ordinary people living in pirate paradise, it is not too rare to witness supernatural powers. In this respect, their knowledge is obviously higher than that of Austria. The people of the colony and the kingdom of the kingdom in the west of Ravi, but as the owner of the big bar and the guards, they have never seen the real demon, and even suspect that this is the church’s smearing of the unofficial extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss struggled to retract his gaze and looked at the cold and dangerous adventurer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes, they, they should have a way to confirm that this is Gilthias.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it Gilch Ess? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean secretly sighed and silently nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss thought for two seconds Extrusion with a fearful smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you can't get it all, you know, it takes some money, about 30%, otherwise You have to wait a long time, 9500 pounds is not a small amount, for Toscat Port, at least a week, this is because there are often pirates here, often there are adventurers to take a reward, so there are always plenty of money In Olawi, in other places, maybe two weeks or even a month. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9,500 pounds is really not a small amount, and Klein clearly remembers that when the city of Tingen was in the first place, the budget of the night squad was only 1,000 pounds a month. It is also shared by the church and the police.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it, said to the bar owner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Do you know me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know." The boss nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein swept everyone and continued to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can find me Where do you live?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yes." The boss didn't dare to lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein "hmm", said in a flat and straightforward tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Before noon tomorrow, send a reward of 6,000 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6000 pounds? This is less than 70%, less than 600 pounds... The boss slammed, and did not expect crazy adventurers to take the initiative to cut prices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you do it?" Klein asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extra £650 is his compensation for the bar. After all, the situation here is quite bad, but this kind of words cannot be said by crazy adventurers themselves. He believes that the bar owner is not a philanthropist, and certainly will not hand over the extra money to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss replied with a serious thought:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enable!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the official process is really not so fast, he is not worried about it, because he intends to borrow some money first, together with his savings, to put the rewards that Gelman Sparrow needs. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much business that can earn hundreds of pounds at a time, never let go! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded, didn't speak again, turned his body and walked to the bar door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When approaching the door, he pulled out a few yellow copper coins from his pocket and threw them to a small round table next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang, these coins rolled to a calming, totaling 8 pence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of doing this, Klein’s footsteps in black long dresses did not stop and slow, and the back disappeared quickly at the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He, what does he mean?" The boss said with amazement and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of bodyguards shook their heads with the same expression, indicating that they did not know what the intention of Gilman Sparo lost the coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only bodyguard who was originally at the gate frowned and thought about it, not sure:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"When he first came in, he took it away, took someone else's beer and threw it to Gilthias.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the cup Beer with a cup of money? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bar was quiet again, although the boss and several bodyguards could not accept such an explanation, but inexplicably felt that this was quite in line with the crazy adventurer German The style of Spalo.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ruined a set of clothes, It’s almost 9 pounds... okay, this time the income is very high... Well, I’ll re-match it tomorrow... After turning into another street, Klein stopped and looked at his own state.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not in a hurry to return to the hotel where he stayed. First, according to the information provided by the "New Lun Party" boss Mosona, he found a drug controlled and helped the gang. Many bad things, even the police who faked the plot to kill witnesses, used a psychic method to confirm the other's crimes, and then let "squirming hunger" enjoy the true meal that belongs to today.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing this, Klein returned to the hotel in a carriage and entered the room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly Arranged, he used rituals to bring "squirming hunger" and slender blood crystals to the fog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit to the top of the bronze long table, gram Ryan did not hesitate to pick up the gloves and release the soul of the "Light Priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strongest of the sequence 5 is a veteran, temperamental and easy-going old man. He puts a simple white priest's robes and bows to the mysterious existence in the fog. He expressed his gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gently decapitated, it is a response, and then directly with a paper pen, writing the next divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'Sun' route formula above 7 or more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying on the back of the chair, he began to use the "dream divination" way to psychic . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray world quickly changed. He saw that the "Light Priest" had a brown parchment in the sun-filled study. The above is a copy of the formula in Guvsak: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 6, 'Notary".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Main material: 1 part of the rhizome of the tree of the elderly, 5 of the tail feathers of the Chiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Auxiliary materials: 100 ml of radiant Qiling tree juice, a golden flower of the golden side, a white flower of the white side, and 5 drops of the water fern juice." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds of pause, the waves floated and rebuilt a luxurious palace with gold statues everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, a man with a pure light that makes people dare not look straight to the half-billions below:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the potion recipe of 'Light of the Priest', remember to drive out the darkness and praise the sun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is excited and unfolding Old parchment in hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 5, 'The Priest of Light'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Main material: the red crown of the king of the dawn rooster, a piece of pure white brilliant stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Auxiliary materials: 5 grams of rosemary, 7 drops of kumquat juice, 10 ml of rock water, 60 ml of blood of the King of the Dawn Rooster.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ritual: In the pure darkness, bury the whole body in ice that would not melt normally, and then take the potion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture disappears quickly and there is no more content.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not Unexpectedly, he knew very well that when it comes to the semi-god field, the seven churches often provide potions and rituals directly, and will not give formulas.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, The figure of "The Priest of Light" has dissipated more than half of the forcible psychic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His painful expression is faint, his head is up, arms Opened out and made a gesture of embracing the sun.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the sun! "The priest of light" closed his eyes and opened his mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last sentence he said, his spirit quickly disintegrated, Falling into the fog, disappearing completely.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A devotee... Klein sighed and commented, then quickly recalled what he saw in his dream and transcribed the recipe. Down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main materials of the "Notary" is the rhizome of the tree of the elders... I remember the "psychologist" potion of Miss Justice The fruit of the tree of the elders is needed... It seems that the "audience" and the "sun" are really likely to be interchanged in high sequences... The ritual of "the priest of light" is difficult for the average person to find ice that normally does not melt. Blocks, but the small "sun" is different, the living creatures of "the land of God's abandonment" may disappear in pure darkness. I have to think of a way to evade... to drive away the darkness, to praise the sun is to play the law? Klein thought for a while. , picked up the slender blood crystals deposited in Gilch's body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; He considered for a few seconds, and carefully wrote the corresponding divination statement: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Its origin. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With items and paper, Klein once again whispered the sentence and entered the dream.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the gray world, he saw the two tall, high-lifting sailboats "dead" and saw Gilthias climbing the ladder and going up to the deck.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
