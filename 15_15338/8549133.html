			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-sit back to the chair until the bells of the church in the distance are ringing again, for seven consecutive times, Zhou Mingrui slowly stands up and comes to the cabinet and takes out Clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black vest, in the same color, tight pants, a half-high hat, with a touch of book, let Zhou Mingrui look into the mirror It seems to be watching an English drama about Victorian stories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not going to the interview, just buying a dish, preparing the material for the transfer ceremony..." Suddenly, he muttered and shook his head and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is so remembered to hang up the upcoming interview, so that it becomes a physical instinct. When your attention is not concentrated enough, you are habitually put on this A decent set of clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breathed, Zhou Mingrui took off his formal attire, vest, put on a brown-yellow old jacket, and the top of his head was changed to a felt hat of the same color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packing up himself, he stepped to the height of the bed, lifted the upper cushion, and stretched his hand from the inconspicuous hole at the bottom, for a while I explored and found the mezzanine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When his right hand was retracted, there was already one more banknote in the palm, about seven or eight, and the color was dark green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Benson’s current savings, even including the three-day living expenses, which only have two five-year-old banknotes, and the rest are a soler’s . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the currency system of the Kingdom of Luen, Süller is on the second floor, from the ancient silver coins, one Sule equals twelve copper pennies, one and five Two face values. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the currency is the gold pound, which also belongs to the banknotes, but is guaranteed by gold and is directly linked. One gold pound is equal to twenty solers, one or five And ten of these three face values. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui unfolded the banknote and smelled a very light and very light special ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the taste of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it’s from the influence of Klein’s memory fragmentation, perhaps because of the hunger that money has never changed. At this moment, Zhou Mingrui feels that he is in love. These little guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, their patterns are so beautiful that George III, who has two mustaches and a serious old-fashioned look, is so cute...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;瞧, the watermark seen through the sun is so enticing, the well-designed anti-counterfeit label makes it completely different from the fake enchanting goods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appreciating for a few tens of seconds, Zhou Mingrui pulled out two one-Suler banknotes, and then re-rolled the rest and stuffed it back into the mezzanine inside the mat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After smoothing the cloth around the hole, Zhou Mingrui folded the two banknotes that were taken out and placed them in the pocket on the left side of the brown-yellow jacket. Separate from a few pennies in your trouser pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do all this, he took the key into the right pocket, took a dark brown large paper bag, and walked quickly to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, hey, the footsteps went from fast to slow and eventually stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui is at the door, his brow does not know when it has wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s suicides have many doubts. If you go out like this, will you encounter any “accidents”? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of contemplation, Zhou Mingrui returned to the desk, opened the drawer, and took out the flashing brass luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only self-defense weapon he can think of and a powerful weapon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has never practiced shooting, but he can only get rid of this pistol, he will certainly scare people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capricorned the cold metal wheel, Zhou Mingrui put the pistol into the pocket where the banknote is, the palm of the hand tightens the banknote, the finger presses the gun tightly, perfect hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of security arises spontaneously, and he knows a little about it. He has a concern:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do you want to accidentally hit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts came to an end, Zhou Mingrui quickly found a way, he took out a pistol, swayed the wheel to the left, and turned the vacant nest that was vacated by "suicide" to the position to be hit, and then collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, even if it is a fire, it is just a "empty bomb"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-engaged the pistol, Zhou Mingrui’s left hand was inserted in his pocket and no longer came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed the hat with his right hand, opened the door and slammed it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corridors during the day are still dim, and the sunlight that the windows can penetrate is quite limited. Zhou Mingrui quickly steps down the stairs and leaves the apartment to feel the splendor and warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, although it is near July, it belongs to the midsummer, but Tingen is located in the north of the Kingdom of Rou, with unique climatic characteristics, and the highest temperature in the year is only 30 degrees Celsius. Less, the morning is cooler, and there are some places on the street where the dirty water is flowing and the debris is littered. In the memory of Klein, where the low-income class lives, even if it has a sewer, similar scenes are never rare, because people More because of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Come and come, delicious fried fish!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's hot and fresh The cuckoo soup, drink a bowl in the morning, and spirit all day!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fresh fish from the port, as long as 5 pence!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Muffins, squid soup with ginger beer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Conch, conch, conch!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The vegetables just collected from the farms outside the city are cheap and fresh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While selling vegetables, selling fruits, selling street food vendors selling food, shouting loudly, greeting the rushing road people, some of them will stop, carefully compare purchases, there are I waved impatiently because today's work has not yet been settled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui smells the stench and smell of the air, the left hand holds the gun firmly, tightens the banknotes, and the right hand holds the round felt hat, slightly curved Waist, bowed down through this raging street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are thieves in places where there are many people, especially in this neighborhood, there are many poor people who are unemployed for temporary work and hungry children driven by people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, when the density of the surrounding population returned to normal, Zhou Mingrui straightened his back and raised his head to look at the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a stray accordionist playing there, the melodies are sometimes melodious, and sometimes warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him, surrounded by a lot of children dressed in sputum, looking sallow because of malnutrition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They listen to music, follow the beat, wiggle the body in accordance with the instinct, dance the homemade dance, the face is full of happiness, just like being a little prince , is a little angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman with a numb expression, the skirt is dirty and the skin is dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes were dull and sluggish. Only when she looked at the group of children, only a slight glimmer of light flashed, seeming to see herself thirty years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui surpassed her and turned to another street, stopping in front of the "Sling Bakery". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the bakery is a 70-year-old grandmother named Wendy Sling, whose hair is all gray and her face is always a gentle smile. Klein had a memory, and she sold bread and pastries here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, her own baking cake and lemon cake are very delicious... Zhou Mingrui swallowed and smiled:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Sling, 8 pounds of rye bread."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, Little Klein, Benson, haven’t come back yet ?" Wendy asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still a few days." Zhou Mingrui vaguely replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter sighs while holding the rye bread:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is really a diligent good guy, there will be a good wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, her mouth is rising, slightly naughty and laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, you have graduated, our Hoi University history graduates~ Well, you can make money soon, you shouldn’t live now. Such an apartment must have at least one of its own washrooms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Sling, you are really like a young and lively lady today." Zhou Mingrui only Can laugh and respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Klein can successfully pass the interview and become a lecturer at the University of Tingen, the whole family will indeed go straight to a well-off! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his memory fragments, he even fantasized to rent a set of suburban houses, five or six rooms upstairs, two bathrooms, one large Balcony, two rooms downstairs, a dining room, a living room, a kitchen, a washroom, an underground storage room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an extravagant hope, even if the instructor of the internship period, the weekly salary can also have 2 gold pounds, after turning positive is 3 gold pounds 10 soler, you must know Klein’s brother, Benson, has been working for several years, and the weekly salary is only 1 pound and 10 sul. The average worker in the factory is even less than 1 pound or just getting started, and the rent of a single-family house is 19 Sule to 1 Pounds 18 Soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the difference between the monthly income of three or four thousand and the monthly income of one thousand and four five..." Zhou Mingrui secretly swears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the premise of all this is to be able to pass an interview with the University of Tingen or the University of Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for other ways, people without backgrounds can’t get recommendations and become public officials, and the history of employment is narrower, aristocrats or bankers, industry The demand for private consultants in the tycoon is not too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that Klein’s knowledge has also become a “fragment”, it is not complete, and many are incomplete. Zhou Mingrui’s expectations for Mrs. Sling are full of guilt and guilty conscience. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I have always been so young." Wendy replied humorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, she put the 16 pieces of rye bread weighed into the dark brown large paper bag that Zhou Mingrui brought, and spread the right hand: < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"9pence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weight of each rye bread is around 0.5 pounds, and the deviation Inevitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "9 pence, did you want 11 pence in the first two days?" Zhou Mingrui asked subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last month it was 15 pence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You want to thank the Abolition of the Grains Act, thank you to those who marched." Wendy smiled with both hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui seems to understand the nod, Klein has some memories of this, just remember that the core of the Grain Act is to protect the price of domestic agricultural products, the price Before rising to a certain extent, it does not import grain and grain originating from countries such as Fernetport, Marcy and Rumburg in the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do some people want to march against it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to say, Zhou Mingrui was afraid to bring out a revolver. He could only carefully pick up the banknotes, take one of them and hand it to Mrs. Sling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrieving three copper pennies, stuffed into the trouser pockets, he carried a paper bag filled with bread, and went to the "Lettuce and Meat" market separated by a street. I worked hard for my sister's tender pea stewed lamb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intersection of Iron Cross Street and Narcissus Street has a municipal square. At this time, a lot of tents have been set up, and clowns dressed in eccentric laughter are distributing leaflets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tomorrow, circus show?" Zhou Mingrui glanced at the flyers in the hands of others and whispered the contents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa definitely likes it, don’t know how to collect tickets? The idea flashed and Zhou Mingrui moved closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is waiting to ask one of the red and yellow clowns, and suddenly there is a hoarse voice on the side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
