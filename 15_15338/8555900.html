			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Klein picked up the diary, Audrey added another sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. 'Footer', there are ten pages of diary that will be given to you afterwards. This is the payment for your previous blessing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put it privately The promise was repeated, lest the "fool" thought that he had forgotten this matter. The reason why she first deducted the "Twilight Hermit" was because she wanted to complete a "debt" first, with A little showing off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide compensation for the blessing... "Magic" Firth chewed these words and suddenly found that he had missed a very important question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the matter of the Abraham family, Mr. "The Fool" sent an "angel" to help me interfere with divination! I should also pay the corresponding rewards... Finished, I didn't even think about it before... I thought that like other ceremonies, the end would be over... Firth was a little scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal ritual magic, when praying for the gods or corresponding help, they will sacrifice the sacrifices in advance, burning the essential oils and herbal extracts that please the target, equivalent to advance Paying a good reward, and in the "fool" related ceremony, many steps can be omitted, the cost can be paid after the event, or even not given, which makes the Fols subconscious accustomed to the former just thank you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is busy looking to the top of the bronze long table, sincerely said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected 'fool 'Sir, your interference with divination has greatly helped me, and I will collect 10 pages of Russell's diary as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See "Justice" The performance of Miss and the "Magician", "Sun" Dairik Berg, suddenly realized that he had found a way to fully express his gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Silver City does not have the so-called diary of Russell the Great... The amount of Mr. Fool is very interested in history, I have to read more similar Information and literature... Dairik’s thoughts turned and made a promise to Mr. Gao’s “Footer”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "downside down man" is watching this all, and there is no doubt about the "fool" who has "angel" as a servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any organization, there must be a role like a "just" lady... The power of the example is endless... There are a lot more "debts" out of thin air. Klein was delighted to say a few words in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a high-ranking "fool", he has been embarrassed to pay directly, and always believes that it is normal and reasonable to help members of their own organization, completely You don't have to make a big market, so you don't manipulate the "world" to do the corresponding performance to remind everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, "justice" they are willing to pay, and Klein will not refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." He nodded with a smile and re-focused his diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On January 13th, steadily contacted Mr. 'Gate'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This powerful and extraordinary person who was lost in the depths of the darkness and trapped in the storm did not eagerly urge me to complete the complicated and difficult ritual and help him return to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He seems to have understood that he must come up with something that will impress me, instead of giving three imaginary wishes, so that I can consider whether to take a hidden, Great risk to save him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. 'Men' did not mention this matter for the time being, but instead talked with interest about the Tarot I invented. Card, huh, huh, the word invented must be quoted. From this point, it can be seen that Mr. Gate can indeed touch the real world in a specific way at a certain time, thus observing many things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I exchanged the 'moon' card, I thought of one thing that Charato had mentioned. He said that the life school worships the moon, not more. Further 'the goddess of the night', yes, the latter half is what I added!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked this question about Mr. Gate's Quaternary The strong, he chuckled twice, and did not make a positive answer, but he was a lot more frank than the cover-up, the head of the divination, the diviner who wanted to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Stars!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is very interesting. I asked, who is the real owner of the ‘moon’? His answer is more and more interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said with a smile, the 'Moon' card currently has no owner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I don't have Misunderstanding, what he means is that the top of the 'moon' path is empty, and the position of sequence 0 is empty! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not right, isn't there a "primitive moon"? Seeing this, Klein came up with such an idea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the "Moon" card does not represent the goddess, he has long anticipated that regardless of the beliefs of the life school, the attitude of the vampires, or the records in the book of Secrets, Vaguely pointed out a problem, "night" is not equal to "the moon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In comparison, the vampire ancestor Lilith and the "primitive moon" are more like this The sequence of the route 0.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the history class of Silver City, Lilith is likely to have fallen into the dark second era, but the "primitive moon" is still today Some people believe in and have responded to the existence. Of course, those who pray to Him will not end well. Why does Mr. "Men" say that "Moon" has no master at present? From the book of Secrets, it can be seen At the time of the Quaternary, the "primitive moon" was always there... Clay I was almost frowning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, he roughly had three guesses: First, Mr. "Gate" did not know enough, and did not know the secret "primitive moon" , but this may be very low. Second, the so-called "primitive moon" is actually a vest of a god. In essence, it does not occupy the sequence 0 position of the "moon" pathway. The third is the sequence 1 of the "moon" pathway or the corresponding The seal is pretending.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is also a possibility that the 'uniqueness' of the 'moon' approach responds on its own. Klein speaks silently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequence of the "Black Emperor" card description of the 0 potion formula, the most important extraordinary material is not the full characteristics of the sequence 1 , but something that is named "uniqueness", different ways have different "uniqueness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True God is unique!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the first guess, the other may not be small... What is the extraordinary way of the "Moon" route? Klein turned to the second page diary, fortunately found this and One page is connected: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I continue to ask, 'Mr. Gate' is not willing to say more, oh, he wants to hang my appetite Let me save him? no way! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hide the curiosity and turn to ridicule the 'door' is not enough respect for the true God, he leisurely, right, answer me leisurely, this is the Quaternary Aristocratic attitude towards the gods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy is too loaded! However, I was really interested in the great aristocracy of the Quaternary, and I asked about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. 'Men' told me that in the Tudor dynasty, there are five nobles, Abraham, Antigonus, Amon, Tamara and Jacob. Each of these families can be called the 'angel family' and has extremely terrible strength.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Angel family', only this name can Explain a lot of questions, it really makes people look forward to! Mr. 'Men' said that the Quaternary angel family is not limited to these five, but also the Zarathu and Zoroastrian families who have been loyal to the Solomon Empire, the Augustus dynasty of Augustus Lun, Einhorn, the Castilla family, the secret activity of Andrérad, the Beria family, and the angel family, which is derived from the true god, the witch family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The last winner of the Quaternary was the Terencer dynasty, but where did their royal family go? Augustus and Soren The angel family divided up the northern continent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As Mr. 'Men' said last time, the number of top cadres in the Quaternary is beyond my imagination, however, Most of them have been buried in the dust of history. Even the Sauron family has been declining and overthrown by me. After another thousand years and two thousand years, perhaps the family of Augustus will cease to exist, only those The true God seems to shine forever in the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
