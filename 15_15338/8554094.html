			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a dare to offer... Klein is so angry and funny when he hears the vampire’s request.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the Utravsky bishop in front and thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, can I borrow your candle? It was the last time, I forgot what its name was."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Utravsky bishop still has a chance to answer in the future, the vampire in the basement has already made a sound Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do? What do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bishop Travski spoke softly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is called a heart candle, what do you borrow it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;French, you are very cooperative, and you know how to use it... Klein’s mouth is upturned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I plan to use it and go directly inside Ask the deepest part of the friend's heart."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, I have some special talents in this area, I am very good at doing similar things..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice has not fallen, The vampire in the basement has shouted: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard, give up your thoughts!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is a curse for the noble blood family!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, feed and feed! I said, I said, I tell you the 'universal key 'Source!'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein suddenly chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you very much Cooperate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! The dirty old man’s friend is really not a good person! As a blood family, I just went to the hospital to steal the blood from the blood bottle. Very restrained, why should I be locked here, listen to the flies like the Bible of Life every day! The vampire in the basement complained angrily.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, if you are really as described in your own words, and you are met, then I have told you a lot of words, but unfortunately, when you got lost in this church, the opposite is a murderer who loves to fight, and now he is sincerely repenting of the priest who is passionate about faith. This can only say that your luck is not so good... However, the condition of Bishop Utravovsky has healed and should not really hurt you. At most, you are detained by you... Klein responded silently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire in the basement paused for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" More than a month ago, I went to the Southern District Hospital to steal blood bottles and drink it. A thief. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He originally wanted to enter the hospital's financial office. Who knows that he lost his way, opened the door to the blood bank, and was caught by me on the spot. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He used the 'master key', he told me that this was discovered during the process of stealing a house before he was stolen. There is also a pocket watch with diamonds, um, in the basement. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He initially thought that the key corresponds to a room or a safe, and tried it all over, and found that all could be opened, this pair For a thief, it was an unimaginable surprise. After that, he repeatedly succeeded until he was caught by me and confiscated the key. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Awful, I didn't even think that the key would make people lost!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very consistent with the picture I saw in my divination... However, is this "master key" a curse? The former owner was detained because he lost his way. The owner was also caught on the spot because of getting lost... Maybe, I really have to throw it on the fog, and take it out when there is a need, but this is a lot of trouble, maybe it will delay things... Klein control With a change in expression, ask without hesitation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire in the basement muttered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are doubting my wisdom, how can I not ask this thing."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said that he was at No. 48, Hewan Avenue, South Bridge, I was going to have time to explore it, and the result... damn it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well, I have finished answering, don't bother me any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't leave, but slowly took out a second One-penny penny denomination of copper coins, whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is lying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven times, Klein, whose eyes turned deep, bounced the coin and watched it roll and fall in the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the head is up, and it is affirmative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the vampire is lying! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the thief’s story is consistent with the picture I saw in my divination. It is confirmed by each other that it should not be fake... The vampire must have lied on the specific address. ! Klein looked at the Utravsky bishop and smiled low: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He lied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Let me think about why he lied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a very unwise move to anger and retaliate against me who has nothing to do with it. It is not conducive to his situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, I think, he is actually asking for help in this way, the address is likely to belong to his companion, priest "Don't you go see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basement was completely silent, and after a few seconds, the vampire laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am simply not willing to tell you that it is so simple, you just threatened me, I lied to retaliate against you, isn't it normal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the feeling of forcing and calming... Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, the real answer? If you lie again, I do not mind This address was delivered to the three churches, and it was said to be related to the recent serial killings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Human beings are really vicious..." The vampire gnawed his teeth Sighed, "32 Wiltie Street, South Bridge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein threw a coin and got the answer that the other party did not lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the vampire does not interfere with the ability to divination... well, go back and check the fog... Klein presses his chest and leans against the basement Heavy stone gate, bent over and bowed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your cooperation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼The vampire in the basement did not respond with a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein turned and was about to leave, he suddenly shouted loudly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Remember, my name is Emlin White. Remember, my name is Emlin White."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember what your name does? I am not planning to save you, I am not prepared, I have no home court advantage, I can beat Father Uttravsky, and he has magical items that return blood... Well, is this vampire companion rewarding people, he I hope I will sell this information? Klein snorted and walked out of the harvest church without saying anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anywhere I found a quiet and uninhabited place, he untied the spirit of the left wrist cuff, and now he is going to explore the 32nd of Wilty Street. Divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer he got was that there was some danger, but not too high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not right. The thief came out with a “master key” when he didn’t encounter anything. Is it dangerous in another hidden place in the house? Klein thought about it for a moment and felt that he was better prepared to go there again, lest he could find an enemy that was difficult to deal with now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, at least I have to wait until I buy a bullet that can purify the shadow of the soul... He bowed his head slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this kind of consideration process, combined with the last fight with the "Dawn Knight" Uttrasky Bishop, Klein suddenly felt that he could vaguely sum up The first code of the "magician": <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not perform without preparation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is a big chance to wear it... Klein silently added a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday morning, Klein prepared butter and baked two slices of bread After that, I was not in a hurry to eat, and I opened the door and took out the newspaper from today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咦, there is a letter... He took the letter that was caught in the newspaper and returned to the restaurant while aiming at the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stuart sent it... It seems that he has completed the preliminary investigation." Klein slightly decapitated, pulled the envelope, and shook the paper. While reading, sit next to the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart claimed that the two suspects did not have any abnormal performance, one guarding the grocery store and the wife and children, living a lifeless life, a busy All kinds of temporary work, rushing to maintain their lives, they are not violent, no urge to fight, and there is no such thing as keeping one person in the room. At the end of the letter, Stuart sighed a few words about the bad conditions in the Eastern District, vowed to save enough money, not to fall there when he was old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your help, if there are other clues, I will share it with you." Seeing the other party failed to find useful traces, Klein simply returned The letter, let him not be involved in the case deeper, so as not to be perceived as dangerous by the "demon", killing hidden dangers in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placing the pen and paper, Klein picked up the bread that had been infiltrated with the butter, and spent the leisure time with the black tea and the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, he is more regrettable that the "eye of wisdom" Mr. Lao, the extraordinary party, has not yet shown signs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the existence of the 'devil' has seriously affected the lives of the extraordinary people of Beckland, and hopes that Mr. Essinger Stanton can detect me. Prompt, something to gain, um, he should be the official 'certified' extraordinary person..." Klein put down the newspaper, picked up the napkin and wiped his mouth, and packed up to go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His arrangement today was planned last week:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the Kingdom Museum to visit Searle Memorial Exhibition! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens, a luxury villa in the Earl of Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey wears a light-colored dress that boldly uses lace, covered with a white fur, waiting for the close-fitting maid Anne to wear her inlaid pearls , the soft cap that hangs down the fine tulle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside her, Su Shi was there, and her neck was tied with a satin bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My beautiful little princess, where are you going to go?" Earl Hall came down from the stairs and asked about his two beautiful mustaches. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey Eyes replied brightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dad, I am going to see Luo Searle Memorial Exhibition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the original Russell Diary's diary, find an opportunity to get some of the "fool" Mr.... she added a sentence in her heart . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
