			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the woods, crossed the artificial lake, Zilingers took the wind and looked away from the chasers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and tried to pretend to sneak into the Tasok River along the canal and then turned to the economic center of Beckland, Hilston Area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he suddenly had a flower in front of his eyes and saw that the various colors in the darkness became very rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green trees are more green, the red fruits are more red, the black water is darker, and everything is like a canvas that has been splashed with oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the high sky that is covered by the blushing month, there are countless transparent shadows that are difficult to describe the form, and there are clear and brilliance of different colors with mysterious knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qilingus found himself paused, floating in the air, his feet were rising black water, and there was a pale skin under the water. Grab the palms out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops! Zilingers understood that he had suffered an ambush from others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the strength of the ambush is absolutely not low! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a huge humanoid skeleton in front of his face. This monster is four meters high, with a dark flame burning in his eye socket, and his bones are illusory and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qilinger’s eyes stared at the enemy without emotion, and the corner of his mouth outlined a sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the gloves of his left palm burst into a brilliant light, and it became as if it were made of pure gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qilingus leaned back and arms wide open as if he was hugging the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pure, blazing brilliance suddenly descends from the sky, enveloping the huge skeleton, and the entire oil painting world is violently turbulent, dark The pale palms under the water evaporate one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the extraordinary ability of the "Priest of Light"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the extraordinary ability of the "Sun" Route Sequence 5! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the nemesis of the dead spirits! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The splendid light column dissipated, and the huge shin bone was first extinguished by the dark flame of the eye socket, and then became transparent, and the inch disappeared in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless Qilingus once again used the ability of "Light Priest" to break the oil-painted world, his expression solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a huge cheekbones on his left hand, nearly four meters tall, and his eyes burned with black flames, exactly like the monsters just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the same skeleton bones emerged from the four sides of Qilingus, one, two, three... more than one hundred One! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hundreds of pairs of eyes burning with black flames cast their sights on the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And below, the dark water is getting higher and higher, and it’s about to touch the foot of Qilingus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pale, illusory palm grows out again, constantly waving up, trying to catch the straw of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You spread out to chase, try to contain." Storm Church Cardinal Ace Sneek gave a sigh of relief and flew up in a sudden hurricane, flew to the direction of Qilingus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Nigan and others did not join the ranks of "the punishers", self-sustaining, standing by the window, standing on the balcony and watching, this time, The ordinary aristocrats who ran in a panic slowly calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there was a darkness in the past, the shouts came and went, they didn’t know what was going on, only the Duke might have encountered an assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger Wilson bit his teeth and ran out of the house of the Duke of Nigan, rushing to the Hillston area around the opposite Municipal Park. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there is only a little hope, he is not willing to miss it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he heard a voice "carry" by the wind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to catch up "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not catch up? The voice of Cardinal Sneek... Alger ran for a few more steps before he paused and turned to look in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the sky above the woods and the artificial lake, and the Archbishop Sneek, wearing a black embroidered storm symbolic robe, floated there and stared down obliquely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger frowned and refused to think about the reason and rushed to the position of the cardinal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the closeness of the distance, he became more and more clear with the extraordinary ability of the "voyager". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Song of God" Founder’s face has no expression, but his gesture shows his dignity, drilling from a black bonnet The white hair of the flowers swayed with the wind, setting off a very serious silver plaque. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger took his eyes and ran out of the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a glimpse of the cold lake surface shining in the blushing moonlight, and a tall figure near the waterfront. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure has a unique wide chin, brown hair behind the head of the ancient warrior's hair, dark green eyes and ice cooling holes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qilings! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurricane Lieutenant" Qilingus! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger was a glimpse, and immediately surprised and happy, can't believe his eyes, doubting that darkness caused an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t had time to make more reactions, and Horan sees the face of Qieringus flying fast and rotten, rotten to the yellow-green pus, rotten to flesh and blood Drop it one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Snapped! Snapped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qilingus’s face was left with only white bones, and the two empty eyes were out of the depression, squatting on the ground on the lake side by side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sound of squeaking, Qilingus was completely scattered, and the clothes were laid on it, blocking the rotten pieces of meat and the bones of Baisensen, blocking the Flashing brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than twenty seconds, Qilingus, one of the seven pirate generals, died in front of Alger in such a strange way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thrilling scene is deeply imprinted in Alger’s mind, making him suspect that he is making a terrible nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Qilingus not successfully escaped? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can it be so strange to die here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to him, he lost his life in a short time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He But the "winder" of Sequence 6, he is the master of "squirming hunger"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who did it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why killing Zilingers...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to contain in Alger When countless thoughts, he heard the magnetic voice of "Singer of God" Aes Snake:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you tell others about the information? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does anyone else know about this information?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger recovered Calm, looking at the body of Qilingus, I was prepared to explain: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just received the information and reported it to the Archbishop." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, he couldn't help but blame in his heart: If Aesne Sneek went for a walk on the Tsock River, he would spend a lot of time looking for him, and Zilingers might not escape at all. The residence of the Duke of Nigan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, such resentment he dare not speak out in front of a high-ranking strongman, can only continue to describe with respect and humility:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people who got the information directly even sacrificed, and the people who transferred did not open the letter, I can confirm this."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am not sure if the source of the intelligence still has a leak, since we can know that others can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger Speaking and talking, I also guessed in the mind who killed the "Hurricane Lieutenant" Qilingus: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entrusted Zilingers to assassinate the Duke of Nigan People, or organizations? But since Qieringus has successfully ran away and there is no possibility of revealing anything, there is no reason to kill him... If it is me, I will let Qilingus lurk, in the thought that he has escaped Baker In the case of Rand, another assassination...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Qilingus always believes in himself, he will not tell anyone in advance of the assassination plan, Nigan The Duke had recently held a meeting for several bills in September. There is no chance, except for Zilingus himself, no one can be sure when and where he will start...unless it is a "prophet" ...may be very low...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other forces? Impossible, Miss Justice said the problem on the spot and transmitted the information in the way of praying to Mr. Fool. Except for us, there can be no organization that gets the news at the same time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Mr. Fool"... Alger was shocked and thought of a possibility: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shot was the leader of Mr. Fool! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He happened to be in Beckland, so "just" helped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger is more and more aware that this guess is close to reality:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only "Tarot" Members and subordinates can know the intelligence for the first time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the "fool" of the genius is the shot, in order to make people feel that things are different, lack of purpose! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of his imagination, Archbishop Sneek was silent for a moment, and said to other "offenders" who came one after another:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Qilingus is dead, a high-ranking strongman killed him, or used a seal of the same order, but it is quite dangerous and not very likely." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After preliminary observation, I think it is a high sequence strongman of the 'Death' route, maybe a member of the spiritual group, but not the one I know, It may also be a member of another hidden organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The motive is unknown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirit The group originated in the southern continent and was said to have been the secret organization established by some descendants of death to try to resurrect the god of death. After being invaded and colonized in the southern continent, they were almost destroyed, but eventually survived tenaciously and developed into the northern continents. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High sequence strong... Yes, only the high sequence strong can kill Zilingers in such a short time! A leader of Mr. "The Fool" is in a high sequence... This is a "half god"! Alger once again looked at the rotten bones of the beach. The whole person’s state was very detached, just like losing all his emotions, and he was staring at everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one day, I betrayed Mr. "The Fool"... He suddenly came up with such an idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, his mind immediately showed the horror of the rapid decay of Zilingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger couldn’t help but shudder and lowered his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he also relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is impossible to break away and it is difficult to resist, you can only choose loyalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call...Qilings died, no one will threaten me with that secret! He vomited and settled down completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
