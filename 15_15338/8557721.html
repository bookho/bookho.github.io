			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, in the palace of the giant residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat in the position of the fool, and lifted his right hand, letting the "Poseidon Scepter" hidden in the debris pile flew out and fell to the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally intended to place this seal of "1" class next to the seat, which is respect for the semi-god items, but After careful consideration, he believes that the "Poseidon Scepter" is still a "fool" who can't match the mysterious and powerful, and can fight against the evil spirits such as "real creator" and "original witch". The level of "the card of 亵渎" is barely enough, so Or throw the "Poseidon Scepter" into the debris pile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the little blue around the white bones, Klein thought, giving the idea of ​​making them a preliminary division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he expected, those blue and blue dots completed their own differentiation according to his will, simply praised "Poseidon", nothing to pray to sink to the bottom, disappear The speed is accelerating, and the confession involves asking for prayers to float upwards, closer to Klein's palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He follows the spiritual intuition and “points” one of the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, he saw the waves rising high and heard the whistling wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An offshore fishing boat is high and low in the undulating dark blue, throwing it up and being overturned at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fishing boat, it is obvious that the local indigenous people are clinging to the mast or pulling the ropes, and doing their best, many of them are horrified I remembered the name of "Poseidon". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein perceives this as an ongoing prayer, and raises the milky white scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the scepter, the blue and blue "gems" bloomed halo one after another, and they entered the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishermen are gradually desperate, and suddenly feel the ship that has been thrown away and settled down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They look around and see the hilly layers of waves that don’t know when they have become peaceful, and the winds that plunder the sea are getting slower and slower. It is as soft as the taste of Zarha beer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark clouds in the airspace dissipated, and a storm will still show the full appearance in the future, and will be forcibly pressed back by mysterious forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishermen quickly woke up from a sluggish state and understood what was going on:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Poseidon" has blessed everyone, "Poseidon" shows his majesty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump, plop, plop! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all squatted on the deck, spread their hands and put them on their lips, not neatly mourning the name of "Poseidon":<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, praise you, the leader of the sea and the spiritual world, the protector of the Rothde Islands, the dominator of the sea creatures, the master of the tsunami and storm, the great Cavi Tuva!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, Klein was inexplicably depressed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear that I saved you, why should I thank Cavitowa? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea snake will only deliberately create a hurricane, pick up the waves, intimidate you, and let you have to believe in it devoutly...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was silent for two seconds, suddenly smirking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cavitowa is dead, now Cavitewa It’s my other identity.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why should I be in a bad mood because someone else thanked me for another identity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the problem that must be paid attention to in the real play of 'No Face Man'? Really integrated into identity, regard his emotions as his own joy I am angry, but I can't forget who I was. It's really hard to do. If you don't pay attention, you will be mentally disordered. If you don't have a spirit, you won't be out of control..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Playing 'Poseidon' is still quite rewarding.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although with fog shielding and isolation, this kind of play may not receive feedback and directly promote me. The digestion of the 'no face' potion, but also can provide experience and lessons to help me find a safer and more effective way to play. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convergence, Klein spreads spirituality to another light spot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time The pray came from a bridge hole, a woman whose clothes were broken and whose body had festered and pused leaned against the corner, muttering the name of "Poseidon" and doing the final confession.<br /><br />&nbsp ;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through her description, Klein seems to have seen her short life with her own eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an indigenous woman whose parents believe in "Poseidon "So, she also believes in "Poseidon". In the first ten years, my father worked as a miner, repaired the road, paved the rails, and the mother used various temporary work, sewing, washing, docking, and intermittent street. The girl, the family is quite difficult but still able to survive.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change happened two years ago, his father died unfortunately in a road accident, Rothschild The railway company only gave a rather meager compensation, and the family gradually embarked on a road.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl was sold to the "Red Theater" by her mother and became a legal prostitute.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Russell had invented a condom, many pirates And the adventurers are eager for a moment of refreshment, unwilling to use, and the "Red Theater" itself is not mandatory, the girl fights against the invalid, can only yield, and finally I do not know who was infected with the disease.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The manager of the "Red Theater" tried to do a simple treatment. When she saw that there was not much improvement, she drove her out because the cost of follow-up treatment was obviously higher than the cost of buying another girl. A lot of expensive.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sick girl not only can't find a new job, but she has no money to rent a house. Her mother and her younger siblings didn't know where to go. Maybe he is already dead, maybe he has been taken away, he has become a slave.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is a wanderer, lives under the bridge, relying on charity food and some Free medicines have been supported for some time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but After all, it was short-lived. Her condition became more and more serious, her body became weaker and weaker, and she quickly reached the end of her life.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, she recalled eating The best time to wear the warmest time, recalling some of the words that pirates and adventurers occasionally said, whispering to "Poseidon":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I want to live like a person..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein once again lifted his cane, only to find that the seal did not have the ability to treat the disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wondered if he would buy a batch of pharmacy from Emlin White in the name of the "world," but found that the prayer picture came from noon, the girl Already gone, in the muddy and dirty bridge hole, in the pain and strong hunger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein silently for a while, so that the perspective of the prayer picture is elevated, showing the position of the bridge hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After writing down the characteristics of the nearby streets and surrounding areas, Klein leaned back on the back of the chair and sighed, laughing without a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a humble wish.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is nothing to play... I try to get you buried Like a person..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He retracted his attention, browsed other light spots, and looked for objects that could be played, but for a while, it was hard to gain In the process, Klein noticed that Karat, Edmonton and other rebel forces held a ceremony to put a group of objects into the altar and pray for "Poseidon." "Giving strength.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary "things" they exchanged are so come... At the level of the demigod, it’s really different... and, They are accustomed to not responding immediately, and seem to want those items to stay overnight in the altar... It seems that the Cavieva sea snake is not responding immediately, it depends on it. Mood, see if it sleeps, otherwise you can only do some instinctive responses, can not make extraordinary "things" in batches... Klein picked up the "Poseidon Scepter" and once again let the blue-green "gems" shine Light up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
