			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, Klein turned on the vision, looked around the room, and saw the blushing moonlight, Mrs. Snow's bedroom was luxurious and gorgeous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thick carpet, spacious space, quilt cover, messy table of skin care products and cosmetics, glittering with different brilliance Jewelry, half-open and half-cloaked cloakroom, light clothing and sling stockings thrown freely in the rocking chair, inlaid with gold silk and many ornaments, one by one into Klein's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most eye-catching thing in the whole room is an unfinished oil painting with Mrs. Shelen’s own naked body, her hair is like a waterfall. The brown pelicans are like the eyes of the deer in the forest. They are pure and hydrated, but they are sharp and eye-catching, and they are quite nose and lips. They also outline the feminine charm of mature women. The two are combined in a contradictory posture, but they are emitted. Amazing charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neck is down, Klein only glanced at it, there is no fineness, this is not a fake dress, he even looked at the other side's "small dirty film". Still afraid of what "Little Yellow Rabbit"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His attention was drawn to the paint, plates, brushes, and a silver-plated full-length mirror next to the painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This combination, such a positional relationship, gave him a strange idea, that is, the author of this painting is Mrs. Shelen Own, not a painter she hooked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beautiful, attractive, charming and pure woman, taking off her clothes, looking at the mirror, portraying herself, recording beauty... This scene feels strange Weird... Mrs. Xuelun is too narcissistic, right? Klein silently sighed and regained his gaze and began to look for evidence of possible crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the teachings of Leonard and Frye, he always wears black gloves, and every time he looks for a place, he must remember the original look in advance so that afterwards recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a "divination", this is not the slightest difficulty. If you forget it, you can easily recall it with the technique of "dream divination." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, before he went out tonight, he also gave himself divination, no danger, quite smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good god stick thing to do...even if I am already a "clown"... Klein self-spoken, spending nearly twenty Minutes searched for Mrs. Shelen’s bedroom, did not find anything worth paying attention to, and did not see a little spiritual light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he stopped in front of the safe in the corner of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron-gray one is one meter high, thick and heavy, giving an unusually strong feeling. It seems to have moved the explosives, and don't want to get rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a characteristic of the steam age... there must be an extremely complex mechanical combination..." Klein tried to unlock it and shamefully failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He temporarily pushed the safe to the end, removed the left hand glove and removed the citrine pendant wrapped around the wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When holding the silver chain, let the spirit sag, Klein removes the heat from the smell in the room and enters the state of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his eyes deep and whispered to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This room has a secret room or Dark grid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This room has a secret room or a dark compartment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seven passes, Klein’s eyelids returned to normal, looking at the citrine pendant and seeing it rotate counterclockwise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means negation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded invisibly, left Mrs. Snown’s bedroom, and quietly rummaged through the study, living room, sun room, etc. But none of them found useful and valuable clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he does not need to use the "sticks to find things" is because he does not know what he is looking for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver pocket watch with a stalked pattern, he glanced open, confirmed the time, and then returned to walk back to Mrs. Shelen’s bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully closing the wooden door, Klein took out the ritual silver plaque, sprayed the spirit, and combined it with the natural forces, blocking the entire room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to "call" himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will use the spirit to drill into the heavy safe and check the contents inside! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't need to know how to unlock!" Klein muttered in Chinese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is praying to yourself, all the processes can be simplified, not so demanding, so Klein took out a candle with sandalwood Ignite with spirituality, even if the altar is arranged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I call in my name:"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fool who does not belong to this era, the mysterious ruler above the fog, the king of yellow and black who is in good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The curse echoed in Mrs. Shelen’s bedroom, and Klein’s spirituality poured out, and the candlelight smashed into a gray, palm-sized light curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he reversed four steps, penetrated the cockroach, and entered the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the "Summoning Gate" behind the top of the old high table, Klein was hoping to respond and suddenly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, come in, by the way, be a divination, see if you can find any clues... Here, in addition to the interference will be ruled out, my ability is still certain Enhanced... and the environment in which my body is in, so that the current divination is equivalent to the use of Mrs. Snown’s carry-on items...” He sat down with a parchment and a round pen in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about divination? Klein fell into thought: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a problem with Mrs. Shelen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, who? Everyone has made a mistake, and everyone has certain problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Xue Lun is involved in crime?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "...this is not rigorous enough. As a social and cultural name, it is normal to involve some dirty and unprovable things...and what is the definition of crime? The law of the Kingdom of Lun, or Indy Republic of the Republic, or my free heart?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts rollover, Klein didn't want to delay time. After all, his body was still in the real world, so he planned to confirm several related divinations that he had done before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick up the pen without writing, and a divination statement appears on the parchment in front of him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The death of John Maynard is influenced by extraordinary factors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where Klein goes to the house of Maynard and helps the police psychic, Divination done, the answer at the time was no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding the silver chain, let the citrine pendant almost touch the word on the parchment, Klein half closed his eyes, silently recited the divination statement: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The death of John Maynard is influenced by extraordinary factors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"John May Nader’s death is influenced by extraordinary factors.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All over, he opened his eyes and looked at the spirit, and the pupils shrank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citrine Pendant is doing a clockwise turn! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clockwise rotation is affirmative! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of Mr. Maynard is influenced by extraordinary factors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stares at the calming spirit, and his heart rolls over the waves:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My divination was influenced by people at the time, and it interfered with..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Shelen is an extraordinary person, a very extraordinary person? Or she has this behind her." The characters helped to jointly plan the death of Dr. Maynard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to remove the powerful contender for the mayor’s throne, Remove the new party’s future members of the House of Commons?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thought flashed, and Klein wrote a new divination statement:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Shelen is an extraordinary person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still meditation seven times, still "spiritual", Klein The current environment in which he is located and some of the information about Mrs. Shelen completed divination and saw the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is that the citrine pendant turns clockwise, the answer is yes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Xue Lun is an extraordinary person... Klein’s heart is tight, no delay, immediately responded to his “call” and pushed the mysterious door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the confusion and dizziness, he saw Mrs. Shelen’s bedroom and saw herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein came to the bulky safe in semi-floating and semi-flight, explored his right hand, and carefully pushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Mrs. Shelen is an extraordinary person, he must be wary of the traps placed in the safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this kind of spiritual state that is doomed with a little bit of mysterious space and most of its own spirituality, Klein does not need to divination, only close to danger, can Get tips - the essence of most divination is to rely on the spirit of the spirit of the spirit to gain revelation, simply by its own spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the transparent palm through the thick metal door, Klein did not notice the slightest abnormality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sweeping up and down, he rushed forward and the whole spirits got into the safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that it was divided into three layers, one with gold bars, thick banknotes and more expensive jewels, and one with a lack of cover. The file, Klein slammed the gang, blew a few times, failed to open it, and saw the contents inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, wait for Mr. Azick’s copper whistle to try again... Klein tried it before, completely wrapped in the spirit In the case of the spell and the Aziz copper whistle, the two items can penetrate the obstacles and appear to be semi-real and semi-illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom layer of the safe is quite strange, with only a black and white photo, a young man with a beautiful eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Xue Lun’s former lover? They were forcibly dismantled, and Mrs. Xue Lun had to marry the old baron, so she began to fall and wandered in one man after another. On the bed, but in the depths of her heart, there is still a pure land. When the night is quiet, I will take out this photo and shed tears..." Kline instantly made up a mournful A big drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, the more he looks, the more wrong he is, because the young man in the photo seems, probably, maybe, looks a little like Mrs. Shelen...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Xue Lun’s younger brother? She is an extraordinary person... Hey, she will not be the path of the witch? Like "Teacher" Teres! Klein suddenly flashed a glimmer of light and shocked himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did Terry stay in Tingen before because she has a companion here? Klein looked at the photos and felt that the young man was quite similar to Mrs. Shelen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His almost transparent face made a grinning expression, feeling that he couldn’t face the "small dirty film" before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convergence, Klein groped around the safe to see if there was something else hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he can’t pick up the paper now, the feeling of passing through the article and passing through the air is different, and there is no feeling between the different density items. same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the groping, Klein suddenly glimpsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
