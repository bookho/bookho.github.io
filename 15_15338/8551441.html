			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein certainly can’t mention the “reader” formula at the beginning, but he didn’t hide his thoughts, after all, the audience was "It's not so easy to fool." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hou. Eugen has a recent abnormal performance?" He first asked Dast Gudrian to develop into a member of the Spiritual Alchemy Association. The madhouse "patient". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dast examines Klein’s eyes, expressions, and movements and thinks about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, he is the same as before. Frankly speaking, I think that if he wants to leave the madhouse, he can be healthy and normal immediately, but he has not done so. He still stays inside. He seems to try to heal every A patient, um, those who are confused or violent or thinking abnormally have gotten a little better, maybe, maybe Hood Eugen is exercising his extraordinary ability in this way."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sequence 7 "Psychologist" corresponding to "Audience"? Maybe higher... From Hood Eugen is not a madhouse doctor, but an incarnation of the patient, indicating that he does not really master the "playing method", it should be like Dust’s guess, he is exercising his extraordinary Ability, and this kind of exercise is close to the "playing method", which can alleviate the negative influence of the potion to some extent, so Hood Eugen simply takes the madhouse as home... Klein calmly shows himself to Hood. Eugen's business has in-depth thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this will make Dast Goodlin feel that he knows a lot, knows a lot, and is unpredictable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein also inferred another thing, that is, the psychological alchemy did not master the "playing method", after all, at least a sequence of 7 Powerful members are not clear - in this era of rare people, no matter which secret organization, sequence 7 is at least the middle level, enough to know some important things, especially those that can effectively help members to fight out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the psychological alchemy club is a secret organization that has been established in the last two or three hundred years, even later. It is normal to not grasp or say that the "playing method" is normal. At present, the only one that explicitly proposes this method is the secret society, which is an ancient organization that has a history of more than 1,500 years and can be traced back to the last era! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咦, the goddess church is still older than the secret society. It’s just three thousand years since the history of the “Revelation of the Sun”. This is not counting the myths and legends of the past... Why didn’t such a church find “playing the law”? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a long history, in such a large organization, there will always be members who have unique ideas and try to experiment with various possibilities, like " Like the psychic, Dai Li, they may not be able to explicitly propose the method of play, but they have started from the name of the potion, touched the right path, and gradually found out something through good feedback, so that generations accumulate , one by one, if the top is a group of curls, it is impossible to sum up the "playing the law"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s thoughts were divergent to make associations, and the whole person suddenly burst into surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of other night-timers who don’t know how to play the law, people like "Psychic" Dai Li are geniuses, which cannot be imitated by ordinary members. Exist, so no one will doubt why Dai Li's experience is difficult to port to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the minds of people who have mastered the "playing the law", this is very weird! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein believes that in the long history of the Church of the Night God, "Psychic" Dai Li is definitely not the first to quickly digest the low-sequence magic with a similar method. The members of the medicine, she may not even enter the top ten, the top fifty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This doesn't make sense from the probabilities...unless Dai Li is not his own comprehension of 'playing the law', with the guidance of others, it can explain the Church of the Night Goddess I can't sum up the 'playing method' because of the old path. All members follow the past will, believe in the experience of their predecessors, and dare not have the slightest rebellion. After all, a rebellion often means losing control... well, In addition to this explanation, there is another possibility that the top of the church has concealed the 'playing method' because of certain problems..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to flip the corresponding information, Look for examples of the extraordinary people who belong to the goddess church to quickly digest the potions and figure out their later endings..." Klein thought deeply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dast looked at his face, waited for a minute or two, and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Police officer, is there any problem with Hood Eugen's performance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not for the time being, I just think of something else." Klein smiled and replied, throwing doubts aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What action has the psychological alchemy club done recently?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, except for a small gathering of Ahowa County that exchanges items and experience." Dast did not answer in a vague way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded lightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to your own situation?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dast controls his own expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not too good, still often heard Some proverbs have some hallucinations. If I am not a psychiatrist, I will even think that I have a similar disease."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he The face was a bit more heavy: "I followed Hood Eugen and your embarrassment, not paying attention to the hallucinations and slang, which made me a lot more comfortable, but they still affected my sleep and made me violent. I become irritable and become not like myself. It is like growing up a whole new body in my body, or I can describe it as a new personality. I am worried and afraid of it. Maybe one day, I will suddenly Out of control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I expected, even without divination, I can expect... Klein is ready to laugh Laughter: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to worry, you are now a peripheral member of the night, have your own welfare, and as an ancient organization, we master A lot of ways to avoid getting out of control, this is not necessarily 100% effective, but it can definitely help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, I personally would like to share my with you. Experience, you have to know that the gentleman standing in front of you, in just a month, completely got rid of the hallucinations and slang, let them no longer appear, you should know from Hood Eugen and other companions How difficult is this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the "viewer" corresponding to the sequence 8 "readers", Klein boasted a little, boasting frankly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police, there are lies in your words, but the main part is real." Dast suddenly calmly said, "What do you want from me?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The audience" is really hard to deceive... Kline smiled and replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No It’s just what I want to get.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Miss Justice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, He knew that Dust would have thought it was the night squad who wanted to get something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If your approach does work, and you want to get the items or intelligence I can touch..." Dast said with discretion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will prepay your benefits." Klein said calmly, "We want the formula of 'readers'."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will not conceal this potion formula and will hand it over to the captain, saying that Dast is in exchange for his experience in mastering the potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the process, Klein will definitely verify the formula, "carelessly" in the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the formula that he exchanged for his personal experience can accumulate more merits for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, plus the previous part, he may not even need to be extra busy, you can apply for the "clown formula" plus the main material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recipe made two transactions, it’s a good deal... Kline’s mood turned better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dast stared at his eyes, silent for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are calm... ... I will try to get this formula, but I am not sure how long it will take. If it is too dangerous, I hope to use other compensation instead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem "Klein didn't intend to force the other side too much, and then implicitly described the "playing the law." "The key to combating out of control lies in the name of the potion. We must understand it and understand its true meaning. This is not just thinking." Things that can be done must be truly experienced. For example, as an 'audience', you have to understand that you are just an 'audience', not an 'actor', and what the 'audience' looks like, you need to go in life. Excavate, try, sum up its 'Code of Conduct' and strictly demand yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
