			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a toss, Klein initially figured out the power of the "Poseidon Scepter":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can create a tsunami, can hurricane, can produce heavy rain, can bring lightning strikes, can make people fly in the sky, walk on the bottom of the sea, almost without any restrictions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost invulnerable and can directly smash the enemy’s head. It allows the holder to never get lost without the superposition of other powerful factors. It can provide unimaginable balance, drive many sea creatures, respond to the prayers of believers, and make people gain the same power as sea monsters, which is equal to the master of a sea area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a god level for Klein, even on the earth, against the formation of the aircraft carrier! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't look at him now is sequence 6, there are a lot of practical extraordinary ability, in the eyes of ordinary people, can be regarded as the real strong, belongs to the legend The character, but still inherently fragile, is still closer to "people". It is really appropriate for a revolver to solve him. Of course, resurrection after death is another matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those possessed by "Poseidon Scepter" all surpassed the "human" level, which is a folklore story, a definitely clear deity in the minds of the people. Or the power of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that starting with sequence 4, it’s called demigod, which is really more like God than human... Klein silently said, Then I laughed at myself: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I can use the 'Poseidon Scepter', I can already serve as the senior deacon of the night, and become the most powerful of the church. One of several people... Ins. Zangweier, if there is no '0-08', and at sea, I can immediately avenge him, and even have a lot of hope for success.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But can I use 'Poseidon'? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has just discovered the negative of "Poseidon Scepter" The effect is amazing. In the dark church, it is easy to get the evaluation of the "1" seal, and I don't know how many researchers are going to die to figure out the best seal and use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three negative effects of "Poseidon Scepter":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is to hold The person becomes violent, it is easy to be angry, it is easy to overheat the mind; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is to periodically let all the biological thinking within a certain range solidify and drain them The blood, including the holder, as to the extent of the range, the specific value of the cycle, not the professional researcher Kleen difficult to give a precise description, can only make a rough estimate, the range is 600 meters to 1 km The period is 20 minutes to 35 minutes; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is to gather and present the prayers of the believers, the sound and the picture are prepared, which makes it easy to make the spirit not strong enough Semi-god holders are directly out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first one is okay, if used only for a short period of time, anger and irritability are acceptable, in simple terms, holding such a strong Seals, you will finish...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third, in fact, there are ways to circumvent, 'Poseidon' response to faith is distance-limited, that is to say As long as you leave the Rothde Islands and the nearby waters, you will not receive the "signal", and you will not be affected. Um... If you have been on the fog, it seems to break the distance limit, just the voice or picture of prayer. Being shielded into a light spot does not have any effect on me, so I can freely choose not to respond, respond to who, how to respond...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I responded At the time, I was able to use the power of 'Poseidon Scepter'...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The biggest problem is the second one, I am okay, when I became a black emperor It belongs to the resentment, no blood, not afraid to be drained, but the surrounding creatures are miserable, this is completely inseparable. I, and the cycle is not good can not grasp ...... a dangerous situation, and to discuss with the enemy, we change the time change locations again about? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein carefully thought about the scenes using "Poseidon Scepter", but it depends on the environment and relies on accurate judgments beforehand. Not very feasible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right, there is another use. When Miss 'Justice' and Mr. 'Inverted Man' pray for help, I no longer have the option of paper angels. I can also provide rain and wind.... Of course, this is all Like the purification ability of the 'sun brooch', it is based on the paper angel...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really think about it, with the 'Poseidon Scepter', I am Above the fog can behave like a real demigod..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s mood is getting better as he discovers that “Poseidon Scepter” is currently It's not completely unusable, which can make him a lot more.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He regains his attention and re-focuses his eyes on the top inlaid with blue-green The sapphire's white bones, thinking about another question, is whether to respond to the prayers of the "Poseidon" believers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cavitowa is dead, There is no need to give those people a target of faith...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, The priests and rebel high-levels who are still alive are aware of the anomalies and no longer receive responses. For a long time, they will not really accept the worst results. People will always be lucky and accustomed to self-comfort. Self-hypnosis, especially when you are in a sinister environment where you can't see the dawn, like Silver City. After more than two thousand years, you are still sacrificing the "creator". I believe that others are just abandoned by disgust, there is always One day I can get a response again...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, the "Poseidon" fanatic believers will not only believe that Caviova has been Falling down, thus stopping the live sacrifice, will also increase the intensity, hoping to get the gods' care again... Without a few years, more than a decade of propaganda and blows, it is difficult to let them wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the Rebels did not have the support of the indigenous god of Cavitewa, I am afraid that they could only fully fall to Fossac or Intis, at that time, with They are likely to be driven to do inhumane things, such as attacks on places where civilians gather, for example, to keep those innocent children in front of their eyes...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You need to give them some guidance. You need to tell them what is the correct way of faith, but you can't burden me. I can help you within the limits of what I can. I am not responsible for saving their fate. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein fingers tapped the edge of the mottled long table and suddenly laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do you want to do real play? ‘Sea God’ Cavi Tuva is a good object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just don't know if this is a foggy partition and I can't get feedback.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, I have to give it a try before I can figure it out." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quickly made a decision, inexplicably feeling refreshed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He After considering it, first of all, there is a scene that needs to be emerged, and then hold the “Poseidon Scepter” to spread the spirituality and touch one of the light spots.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the jungle of the Blue Mountains, a hidden cave.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barehead Rebel Army Kara I fell down from my wheelchair, and my eyes looked desperate and confused to climb the self-broken statue of Cavitowan.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He faintly noticed what, But I don't want to believe it, because it means that all persistence, all sacrifices, all sufferings will be meaningless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No...he is silent Shouting, constantly whispering the name of "Poseidon" Cavitowa, trying to get a response from the gods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was holding his elbows and grabbed his fingers into the mud Ground, one inch and one inch moved to that In front of the shattered statue, the sea snake head carved out of the stone was picked up, and the eye was found to be sagged into a black hole, and the teeth were dropped.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karat almost solidified, and it seemed to have lost light.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he suddenly saw a blurred figure and saw the other side behind it pouring into the sky. A deep blue tsunami and a branch of silvery white lightning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
