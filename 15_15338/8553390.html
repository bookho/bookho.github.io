			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joewood District, Hope Road No. 19. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a close to the Tsock River passing through Beckland, where pedestrians can see a slightly turbid but unusually wide surface through the gap between the houses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Daily Observer reporter Mike Joseph walked down the carriage and pointed to the three-story gray-blue building in front of him, wearing black next to him. Double-breasted long dress, Klein Road wearing a half-high silk hat and gold-rimmed glasses:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the Golden Rose, Joabel District, Gabriel Land Bridge Area The best legal brothel opens every day at 3 pm and is open until 2 am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best legal brothel in the Joawood and Bakerland Bridge areas ? In other words, are these two districts better than it but not legal? Klein silently sighed, aiming at the entrance of the building with a golden rose, without the so-called signboard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this supposed to be a street girl?" he responded with a mouthful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the grade is higher." Mike took the road and led Klein to the front of the building and pushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he entered, Klein smelled a slightly pungent mixed scent and heard a soothing but awkward melody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He instinctively looked around and found that there were black hats and half-high hats on both sides of the entrance and in all corners of the hall as a legal place to operate. These are obviously used to deal with drunks and sluts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden hall is surrounded by a variety of sofas and chairs, and even a piano, and the center is surrounded by dancing places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a color or gold or brown or light yellow or black, a dress or a complicated or simple or gorgeous lady is sitting in a different place, They have mature charms, some are shy and tender, some are youthful, and some are quite beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These ladies or daughters enjoy the melody, or talk to each other, or read newspapers and magazines quietly, or dance with the men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because at 3:30 in the afternoon, there are not many customers, only a few, and at a glance, it is more like a regular dance, not a brothel interior scene. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If at 8 o'clock in the evening, you can see some interesting performances, huh, if there is a lady who is fancy, she invited her to dance in the past. In the beautiful melody, ask her the price. If the two sides can reach an agreement, you can go to a room on the second or third floor to have a wonderful time. Hey, if you are willing to spend money, you can sleep here for a whole night. Mike walked his head to the left and right, suddenly disappeared from the calm and gentleman before, and became slightly frivolous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked into the hall with a smile and approached a young girl who was young and up to fifteen or six years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, is this a nature or a professional performance? Klein looked quite a bit stunned and subconsciously followed Mike. Joseph. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The victim, Hibel, is only 16 years old. In theory, girls of similar age and she are more likely to be friends, know more." Mike lowered his voice and explained one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately picked up a slightly sparse eyebrow and returned to the normal volume:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Which lady did you look at?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just your bodyguard." Klein responded according to normal logic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike Wei nodded nodded, suddenly laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I did that kind of thing I am not used to watching."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will stay out of the door." Klein understood Mike's meaning and put on a rigorous and professional attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike no longer said more, came to the green girl, bent over and reached for invitation to dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Mike came back and sullenly annoyed at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too expensive."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two approached, he whispered again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The girl knows Hibel, but the owner here is Lopez Ms. Z banned them from communicating with others, otherwise they will be severely punished. God, when it comes to punishment, the poor girl even instinctively trembles, I can imagine how terrible it is."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sympathizes but has no way to sigh and press the voice to ask: "So, what are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I don't want to be unfortunate for those girls, I plan to go directly to Ms. Lopez." Mike took Klein's shoulder and said, "Protect me!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned over his body and solemnly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are in a dangerous situation, you must listen to me. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you understand? Listen to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, ok. Mike raised his hands to the shoulder and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, he walked toward the single-seat sofa in the corner, where he sat with a charming, bright dress and a woman with heavy makeup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't want to give up after dancing, lose face in front of those girls, I suggest you talk to Ms. Lopez first, figure out the different girls Price." Mike raised his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady heard the communication between the two, looked over and slowly got up and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, two gentlemen, I am Lopez, do you have a girl who is fancy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Mike suddenly looked up and down and laughed. "I appreciate you very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also very happy with you...in this place Like going home... Kline’s mouth twitched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lomez’s expression was sluggish for a second, and immediately smirked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sorry, I am not feeling well today, you should know that women are uncomfortable every month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See no way to turn Lopez into room communication, Mike silenced for a few seconds and suddenly became serious: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Lopez, I am a journalist, I want to tell you about the situation of Hibel, this is My documents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lomez’s face suddenly became gloomy and replied impatiently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I know the police have already told you, you should go find them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hibel is a wandering orphan, adopted by me, that night She accepted an invitation from a guest to go to the other's home for the night and die on her way back in the early morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, please leave!" Go and invite the ladies to dance."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, Lopez waved and let the two of the next beaters come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a step and stopped in front of Mike Joseph, guarding him back to the hall. The two beaters saw him and did not recklessly drive away. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps, Klein slammed the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is lying."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?" Mike squinted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When she talks, the line of sight is very sloppy, she doesn't dare to look at you, but she will look at you quietly, which shows that she is lying and observing your reaction. In addition, her stance is very high-prepared and looks very anxious.” Klein gave an analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really are a big detective. Only with the keen observation and outstanding reasoning ability can you find these useful details."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just because I am driving The vision, observing the wrong color of Lopez's emotions... Others are the reasons for finding afterwards... Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you Praise, we should go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike Joseph looked back at Lopez and found that she was heading to the side door of the hall, seeming to go to her own lounge The side door belongs to the corner of the corner, the neighborhood is very deserted, and there are many places in the hall that can't see what is happening there. It also guards two thugs outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, we should follow Ms. Lopez and observe her reaction afterwards. Maybe the anxiety just made her do something..." Mike suddenly turned his head. Looking at Klein, "Can you solve the two thugs soon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., I am only responsible for protecting you, and this is illegal. Kline smiled and responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I add money! According to the fighting, a total of 5 pounds! If we flee, there is a fight, it is 10 pounds!" Mike Joseph bite Bite the teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The deal!" Klein took the initiative and shook hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people circled around the circle, avoiding the two former beaters and quietly coming to the side door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guest stops, please leave here." One of them took a step forward and stopped Klein and Mike Joseph. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, we are right..." Klein politely bowed and apologized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, his right fist punched out and hit the abdomen in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thug hits the lower abdomen in an instinctive manner, and the body bends into a bow shape, while Klein, who is standing up straight, erects his left palm and squats on the other side. Behind the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hitter fell directly to the ground, fainting in the past, and his companions obviously did not expect such a situation, looked at it, did not have time Make an effective response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately slipped past, stretched his right palm, and left the boxing abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hitter slammed down and spit out the undigested food, and Klein pulled back his right hand in time and squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, his left hand held the other side, let the beater slowly fall to the ground, no sound of plop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at each other, Klein twisted the handle, pushed the side door open, and flashed in. Mike Joseph buried his body and followed quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are you so skilled...you are just a reporter! In Klein's belly, the footsteps were light but the frequency was fast on the floor-floored hallway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, they heard the voice of Lopez:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Telling Ka Ping, recently Give someone over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaping? Give someone? Klein looked at Mike on the side and found him equally confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, they heard Lopez’s footsteps coming to the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!" Klein pulled Mike and ran to the entrance without going back. He ran out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, he closed the side door and broke the lock so that the people inside would not come out for a while. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the two of them did not happen to go through the hall, near the exit, and grew up in the vaguely angry voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
