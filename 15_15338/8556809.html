Donna asked with a big eyes and curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has no expectation of emotions because she is still young enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erland did not answer immediately, forked the fried fish side ribs, swallowed two bites, and then licked a little Sonia wine . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sweet taste completely dilutes the frying taste of the fried..." He closed his eyes halfway, a foodie's pie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few seconds of recollection, he slowly answered the questions of Donna:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't I know if there is a 'no old spring', and I can't confirm whether the 'immortal king' Agaritu has drunk its spring water. I only know one thing, that is, when I was very young, I heard this. The legend of the pirate king is like 'the king of the five seas' Nast seems to be alive forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their beards must be long and long, beyond Chest!" Denton gave his opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, the 'King of the Five Seas' Nast's beard only under the neck, he sat on the deck, draped in a black and silver side The robes, wearing a spire crown that is twice as tall as his head, look down on everything around him like a god...” Allan’s tone was gradually low, as if he was caught in a quagmire of memories, and it’s hard to break free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle Captain, have you seen the 'King of the Five Seas'?" Donna asked excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most legendary pirate. His name is popular at sea, and even the children in the port city are familiar with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole generation of generations grew up listening to stories about him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a sense, in many people’s perceptions, Nast is equal to the real pirate king... I remember the promotion of the "Black Emperor" One of the conditions is to link the name with the name of the 'Emperor' and go deep into the hearts of the people... Is this a preliminary version of the simple version? I don't know if the "King of the Five Seas" has reached the sequence... Although Kline is focused on tasting the fish, he is still swayed by the people's topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Donna’s question, Ellan sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was still very young and served on the William V. Once, our fleet tried to cross the Scourge of the Raging Sea, where it met the Black Emperor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" In those few minutes, including the fleet chief, everyone lost the will to resist, fortunately Nast did not order to attack us. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cool! "Board Danton's eyes are brightly praised.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erland no longer continues this topic, smiles and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the king of the undead, Agatur, I have not actually seen it. I only know that he is a pale middle-aged man on the reward order. To what extent is it pale? Let me give you an example that is easy to understand, like a dead body that has just begun to rot for a while. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna and Denton heard this metaphor, and subconsciously looked at the corpse of the fisherman who had been riddled with holes, and unknowingly squirmed his throat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the focus of the reward order is not the appearance, the amount, only in Lun, Agato is worth 100,000 pounds, and he is the amount of the four kings. lowest. "Alan has opened the subject. "We continue the story of the treasure. The third is the 'Solo of the Solomon Empire'. In the Quaternary, when the huge empire was dismembered and destroyed, its royal family took the gods. The treasures of Tudor, boarded the ships, and sailed into the depths of the foggy sea, waiting for the opportunity to rebuild the dynasty. However, five hundred years passed, a thousand years passed, and after 1,500 years passed, they never appeared again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that ‘the king of the five seas’ is a part of the heritage of the Solomon Empire. No one knows whether he is a true descendant of the Black Emperor. Cecil added with great interest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The foggy sea?" West Bank of the North Continent? Donna recalled her knowledge of geography.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the west side of the northern continent is the foggy sea, on the east is the sea of ​​Sonia, the south is the violent sea, the north is the North Sea, the east and west sides of the south continent are similar to the northern continent, and the south is the polar sea. Together they are the so-called "five sea". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of Lun is backed by the Hornaces Mountains and the inland sea, east to the Sea of ​​Sonia, south to the Gulf of Desi, occupying the trip There are several excellent estuaries in the sea of ​​violent, but it does not involve the foggy sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way..." Donna was not interested in the treasures that were too far away. Instead, she asked, "What about the fourth treasure?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That belongs to the last empire of the Quaternary, Terenzos, rumored that they built a huge ship equivalent to a city, transferring all the treasures of all the treasures. Above, the ridiculous thing is that their escape did not work, the scheduled passengers and crew did not arrive in the port in time, and none survived.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ship disappeared by itself. Until today, it is still often claimed that on a foggy night, the huge ship was seen passing silently. It was called the 'ghost empire' and the place where it was scattered throughout Suni Yahai, oh, this is summed up from those stories. "Erland looked up at the red moon at high altitude, with a little ridicule in his tone, and a hidden yearning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe tomorrow night, no, today Late, we can see it passing by! Donna looked forward and excitedly thinking about it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein packed up the rest of the food, drank the lipstick tea, and listened with interest to Elland. The remaining treasures: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fifth is the 'Lost Newnes', rumored to be under the misty sea, there is a civilization belonging to a smart creature. The seafarers and adventurers in the sea often find strange items that point to Newnes in the old age, but members of this civilization have never appeared, as if they have long since disappeared into the world. "Alan has drank the remaining Sunia blood wine road. "That is a legacy left by civilization. The richness is absolutely unimaginable." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erland spent two seconds, put down the glass and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The treasure I am most eager for, and actually more than the legend, is the 'Sinking Laurel'. More than a hundred years ago, it was loaded with the gold jewels and various valuables that the kingdom obtained from East Byron, because it deviated from the channel. I sank in the sea of ​​violent seas and the Sunia Sea, and I have not been discovered until today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that the above items total a few million pounds!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Millions Pound?" This number makes Donna stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a businessman’s daughter, and has been educated for many years, she has a vague understanding of what this number represents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Luen, the millionaire is an absolute rich man, second only to the top big aristocrats! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few million pounds? Mrs. Mary, who has joined me for free at the Cragg Club, is a member of the Kingdom’s Air Pollution Investigation Committee. The majority shareholder of Coim’s company is only tens of thousands of pounds. Even so, she is rich enough in the aristocracy and merchant circles. It is a very popular divorced lady, even a nobleman's child... Klein quickly found a comparison object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan's mouth sighs with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can find the sinking laurel ', then I will no longer be the captain, I am going to Bakerland, I want to be a philanthropist, I want to buy land, donate to the political party, get a hereditary title!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to Talim, the Lord, that is, the baron from the baron is about 300,000 pounds, the baron is about 800,000 pounds... If you salvage the treasure, the Viscount, even the count, it is imaginable ... a few million pounds! Klein helped the other party to improve the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is me, I won't be like this, I want to buy a big manor." Cecil also began to think about the life after harvesting the treasure, "I I have to ask a lot of servants and domestic helpers, grow large quantities of wheat, build vineyards, and make wine for myself... and, in large rooms that can be sun-baked, leisurely cattle, sheep and horses, bread from their own mills, like Draw a beautiful view..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
