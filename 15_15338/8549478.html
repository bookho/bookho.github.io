			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick talked to himself while looking at Quentin Cohen, looking for hints and inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cohen with a dark eye and a dark blue scorpion shook his head without hesitation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have a point Impression."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...well, maybe just the same root." Azick put down his left hand and laughed at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was slightly disappointed with the results, but couldn’t help but add one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Teacher, Mr. Azick, you know, I am very interested in exploring and restoring the history of the Quaternary. If you have something to think about, or have other information, can you write to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Because of today's business, the senior associate professor of Cohen, who is gray-haired, is quite satisfied with Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azk also nodded with a nod:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your address is the one before?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the time being, but I am going to move now, I will write to you at that time." Klein answered with respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cohen senior associate professor shakes the black cane road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really should change for a better environment "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Klein glanced at the newspaper in Azick's hand and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, Mr. Azick, what did the newspaper say about Welch and Naya? I only knew a little from the police responsible for the investigation."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick is waiting to answer, and the old associate professor of Cohen, who is not too much wrinkles, suddenly took a pocket watch along the gold chain on the black tuxedo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clicked on it and clicked on his cane:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The meeting is about to begin Azick, we can't delay, you give the newspaper to Moretti."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Azick turned the newspaper in his hand. Delivered to Klein, "We have to go upstairs, remember to write, my address with Cohen has not changed, it is still the office of the history department of Hoy University, haha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He turned and smiled and left the room with Cohen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took off the hat and watched the two gentlemen leave, then bid farewell to the owner of the office, Harvin Stone, along the corridor, slowly out of the gray three The gate of a small building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sunshine, he lifted his cane, unfolded the newspaper, and saw that the head was:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morning News." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tingen has a lot of newspapers and magazines...What morning, evening, honest, Bakerland, Tasok , family magazines, story comments... Klein recalled a bit, and there are seven or eight names in their minds. Of course, some of them are not local, from steam-based "distribution"<br /><br />&nbsp Today, as industrial papermaking and printing become more developed, the price of a newspaper has dropped to 1 pence, and the coverage of the population has become wider and wider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not carefully look at other content, and soon found a "news version" of "indoor robbery and murder" report;<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... According to the police department, Mr. Welch’s home scene was terrible and lost all the gold, jewellery and banknotes, as well as all the valuable, easy-to-take items, even There are no copper pennies left. There is reason to believe that this is a group of cruel and sinister gangsters who will not hesitate to kill innocent people who have seen them, such as Mr. Welch, such as Ms. Naya."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a violation of the laws of the kingdom! This is a provocation to public safety! No one wants to encounter similar things! Of course, the good news is that the police department has locked in The murderer caught the principal offender and we will give follow-up reports as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reporter, John Browning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing a treatment and disguising... Klein walked on the boulevard and nodded invisibly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flipped the newspaper with his hands and read other news and serial stories while walking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the cold hair behind him was all erected, as if there was a fine needle stuck there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is watching me? Looking at me? Monitor me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thought came to life, and Klein vaguely realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the Earth, he also felt the invisible gaze, and finally found the source of the gaze, but never once reflected as clearly as before, "conclusion" clear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing in the original main memory fragment, too! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it through, or is that strange "transportation ceremony" that made my "sixth sense" stronger? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein resisted the urge to find a gaze, learned novels, movies, and TV shows that he had seen, slowly stepping down, picking up newspapers, and looking forward to Yihe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed by him, he looked around the landscape a little bit and then turned around naturally to see the surrounding situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the trees, the lawn, and the students passing by, there are no people here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Klein is sure who is still watching himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s heartbeat speeds up, blood swells with fierce screams Spray thin flow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He unfolds the newspaper, half covering his face, afraid that someone will find his expression wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he clenched his cane and prepared for the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One step, two steps, three steps, Klein moves slowly, just like just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was sniffed and looked at it still, but there was no danger of sudden explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body walked a little stiffly through the avenue. He arrived at the waiting point of the public carriage, and fortunately found that there was just one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Iron...Zote...no, Champagne Street." Klein continued to reject his own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally planned to go home directly, but was afraid to lead the sneaky sneaky sneaker to the apartment, and then, wanted to go to Zouteland Street, "Night people" or colleagues asked for help, but they were worried that the other party was stunned and let themselves be exposed. Therefore, they had to pick a place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"6 pence." The toll collector replied in a familiar manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t bring the gold pound out today, put them in the place where they used to hide money, just took away the two Sule’s banknotes, and he came before I also spent the same amount of money, and I just had 1 Sule 6 pence left, so I took all the coins and gave them to the toll collector. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the carriage, find the position to sit down, as the door closes, Klein feels that the uneasiness of being watched has finally disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly exhaled, only feeling a slight tremor in his hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do next? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked out the window of the carriage and tried to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the premise of not clearing the purpose of the snooper, it is considered malicious! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One idea emerged, and he was vetoed by Klein one by one. He had never experienced similar things, and it took him a few minutes to find his ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must notify the "nights", only they can really solve the trouble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but can’t go straight like this, it’s exposed, maybe this is the purpose of the other party...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Following this line of thinking, Klein made a rough plan one after another, and the idea became clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spit out the turbidity, restored the basic calm, and carefully looked at the scenery swept away from the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the carriage arrived at Champagne Street, the accident did not happen, but after Klein pushed the door and got off the bus, he immediately had the feeling of uneasiness stared at being watched. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pretended not to notice anything, took the newspaper, carried a cane, and walked slowly towards Zouteland Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he did not enter the street, but instead went to the red moon street on the back, where there was a beautiful white square and a large spire church! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Selena Church! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Night Goddess Church at the headquarters in Tingen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a believer, it is not a strange thing to come to the mass and pray on the rest day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cathedral has a distinct earth-like Gothic style, black overall, with a high, mottled clock tower on the façade, located in red and blue Above the huge center buttress between the lattice windows, the clouds are inserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stepped into the church and walked along the aisle to the Great Prayer Hall, all the way through, with a narrow blue window inlaid with blue and red shards. It was dyed with the color of the light, the blue was nearly black, the red was like the moon, and the surrounding was very dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of being watched disappeared again, and Klein looked as usual, without joy, step by step to the open big prayer hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no high window here, the deep darkness becomes the protagonist, but behind the arched platform, the gate is facing the wall, ten or twenty The round hole of the size of the fist penetrates out, letting the splendid, pure sun shine into it, condensing and bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a pedestrian in the night, suddenly looking up, seeing the starry sky, seeing a dragonfly, it is so sublime, so pure, so sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he always thought that the gods could be studied and understood, Klein couldn’t help but bow his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the low and gentle sermon of the bishop, he walked quietly on the aisle separating the left and right seats, looking for a place where no one was close to the passage, sitting slowly It’s down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying the cane against the back of the front chair, Klein took off the top hat, rested on the thigh with the newspaper, and then clasped his hands against the hanging forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process, he is slow and orderly, just like making prayers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed his eyes and listened quietly to the voice of the bishop in the dark sight:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "They are naked, have no clothes and no food, and are unobstructed in the cold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are wet by the rain, because there is no shelter, it is tight Hold the rock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are the mothers whose children were taken away, they are orphans who have lost hope, they are the poor who have been forced to leave the right path." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The night did not give up and gave them care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......(Note 1)< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echo echoes, sounds in the ear, Klein is dark in front of the eyes, the mind is cleaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmly understood this until the bishop completed the sermon and ended the mass ceremonies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop opened the door to the confession room, a gentleman, a lady, and lined up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
