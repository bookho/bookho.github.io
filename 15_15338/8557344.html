			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer to one of the two main streets, and Klein, who had changed his face, went straight to the green postbox and took a long time out of his pocket. Prepared letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his "death notice" written in the official format of the police station, sent to the sheriff of the port town of Simim, the content is local residents Winter's news of death in Beyam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When deciding to play this role, Klein has already developed a corresponding plan, so that things can go smoothly, without deviating from the track, and not causing the girl Hard to make up for damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His plan is to use the "Sleep Charm" to disguise the real play as a dream, so that if the girl Rui Ni has no love for Winter, directly He refused his confession and did not feel any embarrassment when he heard about the death of the other party. At most, he felt afraid, and this can be effectively comforted by going to church to pray and confess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the girl is also fond of Winter, responding to the confession, the reason for dreams helps Klein get away, and the death notice can break the core. Nie’s expectation does not have a bad influence on her future life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But even this is still a bit cruel, no matter what kind of woman, in the face of the boy who likes to confess after the death, it is definitely grief, I can't let it go for a long time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... If you don’t do anything, if the death of Winter is passed back normally, Rui Ni will be very sad, just Not necessarily so serious, but the knot in her heart may never be solved, and it will be entangled in the whole life when Went ventured out to pursue the future of the two, or simply did not like himself...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing wrong with this ending. When she relieves the pain, she will treat the future life with the gentleness she once loved.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, no matter what, in order to play, forcibly involved in the lives of others, so that innocent people are affected to some extent, even if there is an excuse to complete the wish, it is not really kind, really like Rose. As said, the more extraordinary the way, the more The feeling of distortion and sorrow, 'playing the law' is not necessarily a catalyst... I can only try to minimize this impact..." After the delivery, Klein breathed a sigh of relief and featured a local character with no features. Face, walk to the only hotel in the town.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, he summed up the experience just now, that is, "true disguise as another person and "Harvest feedback" should be the main clause of the "No Faces Code", second only to "You can pretend to be anyone, but only yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change To do some "faceless people", perhaps for this play, block Wente's death, promise Rui Ni's confession, spend one to two years with each other in love, get married, have children, and then, regardless of this identity The bondage of the relationship, remember who you are, leave it coldly... In the process, if it has not been exposed, the potion will almost be digested... but I really can't do it! I can't pass my own. I can only hit the ball... Klein is awkward, inexplicably afraid <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and silently laughed at himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The extraordinary must fight against not only Danger and madness, as well as a variety of evil thoughts that stem from oneself, and the gloomy gravity that sinks in a little bit of indifference...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even so, at the end It may also be polluted by the abyss, becoming the kind of 'monster' that he vowed to clear, oh..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convergence, Klein stepped into the hotel, To the boss behind the counter: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A normal room. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin-skinned boss looked up and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A valid identification document. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I just squeeze my face? Klein smirked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forgot to carry it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you can't stay, this is the rule of our town. "The boss re-embeds his head and calculates today's income and expenditure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss suddenly opened his eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, put it away! I don't want to be locked up by the sheriff!<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go out, go out, you are a dirty guy with no proof of identity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was slightly driven out of the hotel, unable to believe that the omnipotent money had just lost its effect.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, he turned into an unmanned alley and changed back to the deep-minded Gelman Sparo.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Ryan returned to the hotel and tapped the counter table, using the Lun language with Beckland's accent:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One room. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss looked up and immediately put down the items in his hand, stood up and nodded and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Okay, ok. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you need a room that can see the sea, is it still quiet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He switched to The lame, Lun language with a strong spice, no mention of identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a real world... Klein groaned and politely responded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quiet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, yes, good." The boss responded with a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he called the waiter to guard the counter, took the key and led Klein to the second floor:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr., how many days do you need to stay? Every night is 1 Sule 5 pence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight." Klein was somewhat affected. Without this enthusiasm, the words replied succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the "Azure Winds" Hotel, he and Daniz lived in a luxury suite, one night was 5 Sule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the room chosen by the boss is clean and tidy, and the common wet conditions in the port hotel are basically not. Klein looks around and is happy to nod: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my pleasure." Obvious fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein put down his luggage, took a break, got up and went back to the ground floor, ready to solve the dinner problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first floor, in addition to the counter, there are a lot of tables in the mess, the surface is slightly greasy, the corners, the fireplace burning, emitting light and heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South of Rothschild is about 10 degrees in the winter, but for the locals, this is still a cold weather that needs to be grilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein randomly found a place to sit down, ordered a local speciality barbecue and fragrant mushroom soup, the staple food is potato bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of waiting, he quietly swept the diners in the restaurant, and his instinct fell to a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady has a simple black hair and a pair of very characteristic blue-gray eyelids, which look good and look good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is obviously not a native, but she is wearing a men’s shirt with a thick brown jacket and a rounded hat with a concave top in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the more common adventurer in the sea, as well as the three men on the same table, with obvious sun and rain characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein never concealed his attitude of admiring a beautiful lady, but the other party caught his attention but not from appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have fresher mud spots on their boots... just back in the jungle? Oh, it’s an adventurer... Klein made a preliminary judgment based on some clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the four adventurers came by boat from Bayam, even if they had stepped on the sewage and encountered mud, the traces should have dried out. The road inside the town was clean and tidy because it didn't rain for the past two days. It was just dusty. Excluding these two possibilities, there was only one explanation for the other party to explore and return from the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had heard before that many adventurers would go deep into the virgin forests of the colonial islands, looking for abandoned and forgotten pagan temples or altars. In those places, there are often ancient gold and jewels, but they were buried in places where no one knows about them. The bars in each island are not lacking in the legend of anyone who is full of treasures in the jungle adventure. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be evil spirits in those places... It’s better to hunt pirates, at least get the information in advance... Klein regained his gaze and concentrated on waiting for food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seven Great Churches classify the various gods in the original beliefs of the colonies as evil spirits, but Klein believes that there should be some part of the natural spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the special barbecues came up, they were cut into small pieces, skewered on wooden signs, and the surface was coated with brown-red sauce, scent Rich, attractive color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a bit like the roast skewers of the last generation... In Lun, it’s a large piece of meat, which is baked and baked by the chef... The way to add more flavor... Klein picked up the roots and took a piece of meat down, only the gravy was slightly overflowing, and the salty scent was slightly sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like the type I like! He nodded with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meal, Klein was quite satisfied, and even tasted the local "eucalyptus sap", which is a special drink, just like Lemonade with sugar and milk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the room, because last night hunting, not sleeping all night, he finished washing early, put out the fireplace, and got into the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sleeping too early, there is bound to be a problem, that is, waking up in the middle of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s dream was interrupted, opened his eyes, and accumulated a little bit of courage to open the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The midnight Simi is eighty-nine degrees Celsius, and in terms of physical sense, it is cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quietly lying for a while, Klein stretched out his arm and shivered back silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a few seconds, he once again explored and picked up the "sun brooch" on the bedside table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this only provides a spiritual summer, the essence does not provide heat, but at least can deceive yourself, it is not cold now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein moved out of the bed and went straight to the bathroom in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He narrowed his eyes and relieved the pressure on his lower abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everything is done, he pulls his pants and prepares to wash his hands, and the inspiration is triggered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein frowned slightly and looked up at the vents in the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a black and slippery thing fell and hung there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a poisonous snake that spits the core! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was startled, opened his mouth and made a sound:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake was hit hard and turned into two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? Klein stared for a few seconds, seeing no more movements, squatting out of the bathroom and taking out a gold coin from his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
