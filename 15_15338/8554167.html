			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the outside, there is nothing special about the bookmark. Russell’s portraits can be seen everywhere in the commemorative exhibition. The image of the emperor is still in middle age. The same is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned over and over again and found a small stamp that was poked out to confirm that this was the bookmark that Miss Justice had verified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tries to spread his spirituality and slowly infuse it. The result is just like ordinary things. Spirituality is only flowing, not infiltrated, nor able to Make any changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, Russell’s idea is to find a “good person” that will not be specifically limited to extraordinary people... Klein thought about it and switched to Fossa克语低沉 pronunciation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pirate King!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bookmark still does not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried it again in Gufsak, ​​Intis, and Lunes, but he still only got the same result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the language of the mysterious field such as Giant, Elvish, and Dragon, because of too limited goals, Klein can only try it without any hope. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt he failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Klein used the words in the Vosak language and translated: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"one piece !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bookmark lies quietly in his palm and does not show any abnormality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein followed the previous process and tried it again in a different language, and the results continued to suffer setbacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that my initial guess is wrong. Russell in youth will use the stalk of One Piece to joke, but he may not be like this in old age. People will always be old and change.” Klein reflected on the mistake and tapped the edge of the mottled long table with his fingers, trying to reason about the opening method from some of the information revealed in the diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he has a pen and paper, and he has recorded the process of thinking, so as to avoid confusion and contradiction:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this matter, Russell is both crazy and desperate, and it also shows a bad taste. The description of 'the winners' is not in line with the current world language habits. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, what is certain is that he really wanted some people to accidentally discover the speciality of '亵渎牌'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since this is the case, the method of opening it will not be too unimaginable, and there may be possibilities in daily life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"" Russell needs coincidence coincidence, for example, when holding a bookmark with no value and casually reading a specific vocabulary, then, congratulations, you have an adventure! Well, this is very It is in line with that bad taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to this logic, different '亵渎之牌' should There are different opening spells, and you can motivate all the things like 'Big Card' with just one word, obviously not Russell's style."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What is the opening spell of this card? Well, the first thing that can be ruled out is the ones that are commonly used, which will always be said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, manufacture At the time of '亵渎之牌', Russell’s state was desperate, crazy, reluctant, nostalgic, struggling, angry, and could try to enter this state of mind, pretending that I was Russell at that time. Imagine what would be set up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stopped the pen and played Roselle, trying to find inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first tried some curses and hopes in various languages ​​plus Guvsack, and shamefully harvested the failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, he is trying to figure out what a most desperate strongman would be most reluctant to do:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His wife Matilda? Such a romantic guy, should not have such deep feelings for the original match."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His child? Eldest daughter Bernard, eldest son Charles, second son Bonova..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the diary, the most difficult thing for him to be relieved It is his daughter, who may become the Bernard of the mysterious world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein paused and took a breath, ready to make new attempts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Berner." He read in Intis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bookmarks are unresponsive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has switched to Lun, Plateau, and Fossic, but still can't get the desired result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed, his voice low, and the corresponding Guuffsack syllable:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Berner黛."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name reverberates over the empty, silent fog, and Klein is looking for new inspiration. Suddenly I feel the bookmark in my hand sinks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It immediately generates an invisible vortex that madly absorbs the spirit of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very big burden for ordinary people, but for the "magician" of Sequence 7, it is really not too serious. Klein easily survived this level and couldn't help but look at the things in the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bookmarks, the bright light shines a little, and the image of the Russell emperor is completely new. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat on an ancient stone throne with a black crown inlaid with various gems on his head. He was wearing dark armor and covered with the same color. The cloak, holding the scepter in his hand, his eyes are indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top left corner of the bookmark, the star of the star condenses a line of text:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" :Black Emperor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sequence 0! Sure enough to hide the secret of God! The black emperor turned out to be the sequence 0... Klein smiled and thought half-sighing and wondering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the bookmark became three-dimensional, like a book of miniatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book has no wind and moves, showing a Russell image with a white hood, and a corresponding ancient Fossack text description: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 9, Lawyer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good at discovering and exploiting loopholes and opponents Weakness, with excellent eloquence and speculative logic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Potion recipe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at the recipe and touched it without looking at it. The book turned over:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 8: Barbarian "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem that cannot be solved by law will surely be put into strength. This is also a kind of rule... the extraordinary person of this sequence is spiritual. The influence has a fairly high resistance..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Potion recipe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Kline’s touch, “Big Card” The book is flipped page by page:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 7: Briber."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 6: Corrupted Baron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 5: Chaotic Tutor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Sequence 4: The Earl of Fallen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 3: Frenzy Mage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 2: Duke of Entropy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 1: Order Prince."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 0: Black Emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a general review, Klein couldn’t help but sigh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This really hides the mystery of being a god!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s no wonder that the extraordinary people of this path have reached a high sequence and will try to establish a kingdom. Will walk on the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the ritual of God is required to do this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be promoted from Sequence 1 "The Prince of the Order" to "Black Emperor", the ritual required is to have your own country and let your name and emperor The title is linked together and becomes common sense of the people, and it is also necessary to establish a set of rules that are rigorously complex but out of normal, including architectural style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, drive the people, secretly establish nine mausoleums similar to the pyramids, and then enter one of them, in the majority of the people involved, scattered in different cities In the corresponding ritual ceremony, take the potion of sequence 0. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the promotion is successful, the "Black Emperor" will not really die until the nine secret tombs are completely destroyed. Even if it dies, He can also go from one of the tombs. Nei Su wakes up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s even more terrifying is that even if you succeed in blasphemy and destroy all nine mausoleums, as long as there is a certain amount of remnant in the order established by that god, then He is also likely to be resurrected, which seems to be a loophole in death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best way to get him completely annihilated is to have a new "black emperor"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the god!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And mortals are unable to fight against the gods, even angels The same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without being a god, you can never imagine the power of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russell made a few words in the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Klein also knows one thing, that is, once a route has the true God of sequence 0, it is impossible to appear the extraordinary of sequence 1. One is impossible. If there is no sequence 0, then in the same way, sequence 1 has up to three digits. This is the detailed content of the extraordinary conservation and immortality laws! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the description of the 10 sequences of the "Black Emperor", "Klein", Klein clearly sees that the biggest feature of this route is that Derived into the shadow of order! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell also mentioned that after the promotion of the sequence, holding this "Big Card" will produce some kind of extraordinary material that it needs. Subtle induction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, only for the high sequencers corresponding to the "Black Emperor" route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, this is of no use to me." Klein watched the "Big Card" re-thinning and turned into a playing card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is no longer disguised, the surface is Russell sitting on the stone throne, is the sequence 0 "Black Emperor"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein silenced for a few seconds, silently said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This card is the biggest for me The effect is to get the recipe for the items you need, followed by some knowledge about the gods and sequences. In addition, there is almost no place to come in handy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, at least this way, as the leader of the Tarot Club, as a fool, I am no longer empty, I have mastered a way of God, and will not even be able to get a high-sequence formula!"
