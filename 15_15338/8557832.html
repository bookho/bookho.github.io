			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the idea, Klein immediately planned to do some preparatory work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to explore the spiritual world, choose the object that is suitable for being a messenger, and when you leave the Rothde Islands and the surrounding waters, bring the "Poseidon Scepter" to the past. Convince the target to be your own messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you get lost, or you are in a dangerous situation, immediately end the call and return to the fog, so there is basically no risk... Klein has been stunned for a few seconds, anti-lock At the door of the house, I began to hold my own ceremony to summon myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the ceremony, he quickly entered the fog, but did not rush to respond, but sat down and let the "Poseidon Scepter" fly from the debris Out, fall to the palm of your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intends to routinely browse the prayers of believers to see if there is anything that needs to be answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, Klein found that some prayers were actually very interesting, because human beings can deceive friends and deceive relatives, but it is difficult to convince them when they confess or pray to the gods. Live the most real ideas, at the most, make some modifications to make them look so bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mixed-race who entered the middle of the Bayam Police Department apparently has a tendency to convert to the "Lord of the Storm", but when he confessed, he tried his best to act. Described as a plan to bear the burden of humiliation. For a better tomorrow of local descent, he can only repent of the pain to the gods, hoping that he will protect himself from the identity of the storm believers and climb higher in the police system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his words did not sound flawed, his volatility of thoughts and the ups and downs of his emotions were clearly presented in the prayer picture. It was a A feeling that cannot be concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-deception while also wanting to deceive the gods...Changed to Cavitewa, this wise little sea snake, maybe you believe it... I gave it to him A lightning bolt, or send him ten wind blades? Well, the mixed-race who can climb to the position of senior inspector is very good. Keep it. The twenty-five children also have the use of twenty-five children... Klein raised the "Poseidon Scepter" and let one of the blue and blue "gems" 熠熠Glittering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light shines into the picture, invisibly infiltrating the senior inspector named Braa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a curse, nor is it an influence. It is a mark of divine nature and is hardly noticed by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, it’s a unilateral “special attention”... Klein silently added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to browse and saw a young believer with a skinny bronze hair pleading for the gods to let a man named Zhangm suffer a storm, buried in the ocean, surface The reason is that the other party is not pious enough. The real thought in the heart is that the same fishermen, Zhangm has more harvests than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something broken, the heart is really elusive... Klein frowned first, silently, and then had a vague idea: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't want to be a real player, you don't have to have loopholes in appearance, habits, and so on. You have to maintain the same basic personality. You can't make too many changes, and the personality is different from everyone. There are certain differences...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Browse through the prayers of believers, I am equal to not having to be so troubled to see different personalities, different psychological conditions, and the 'face' of thousands of people, not just the looks...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This has a very important role in the follow-up play of my 'faceless man' and can save time in accumulating experience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is increasingly feeling "Poseidon" is not helpful to yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you actually play a half-god, it will not give feedback, and certainly there will be no small gains... This is a high-level state The experience... Kline’s spirit is so refreshing that it’s no longer perfunctory when browsing the prayer screen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene of the scene flew past, his eyes stopped on a businessman called Ralph. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trader praised the miracle of "Poseidon" reappearing on the earth, saying that he would contribute one-third of his net worth, which is worth 20,000 gold pounds. The property was given to the Rebels, half as military expenses and half to reshape the statue of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is no need to be so troublesome, just to sacrifice directly... Klein snorted half-jokingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it, with the background of the coexistence of the waves and the storm, the background of heavy rain and lightning, and the low response: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help your compatriots, companions, Praise my name.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The young lambs need help, food and education. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intends to let Ralph build a charitable fund with 20,000 gold pounds of wealth, and widely seek donations from the community to compensate for the damage, build consensus, help rule An excuse to provide certain food, clothing and education to children of local descent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the rebel army’s military expenses, Klein thought very well, here In the world of extraordinary power, it is very difficult to succeed only by the resistance of the local people in the colony. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the help of foreign countries such as Fossac and Intis.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The provision of funds is undoubtedly a part of help.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, you can’t add a “should be justified to spend money” in the Ten Commandments. Losing the image of "Poseidon"... The rebel army should not always think about destroying the garrison. It is necessary to destroy the traffic facilities and improve the difficulty of the Governor's Office. To promote the talk... As a keyboard powerhouse, Klein is similar. There is no shortage of ideas.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly converges on hair Scattered thinking, made a divination today to explore whether the spiritual world is dangerous.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After getting a dangerous revelation, Klein brought the "Black Emperor" card, Naturally changing the image and stepping into the “gate of summoning.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the real world, he will put a few magical items into the body, prevent it, Then, up to the next time, with meditation, I sensed the spiritual world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One step forward, through the invisible curtain, Klein illusory floated.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is surrounded by red, yellow, blue, green and other color blocks, as if the most abstract oil painting, the concept of human beings up and down, etc. is no longer common here, if In a similar way, the direction and position will be lost.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein roams carefully and casually, and sometimes sees a child’s stick-like yellow sun, sometimes There is no real river flowing through it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A flat woman with a half-length, a moon with a smile, a canoe with a head and tail, a ball of chaos, a serpent-shaped ladder leading to a seven-light clean light...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In this chaotic world, except for the spiritual creatures, all kinds of information are compounded in the form of abstract symbols. Therefore, the divination can only be revelation, and you need to interpret it yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those symbolic symbols, there may be a chance to live and become a non-physical monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the spiritual world that cannot be understood and treated with human common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another question that makes Klein wonder. When he came in last time, it’s easy to discover the spiritual creatures and notice that they don’t know where to look. Come over, the creepy eyes, the headless woman carrying four heads, the black-and-white eyes and the giant jellyfish with the tentacles and the gimmicks are all so simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, he roamed for a while, a spiritual creature didn’t see it, even the shadows in the distance that were difficult to describe the form disappeared. It seems to be hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s always impossible to be afraid to give me a messenger? Well, I am a spiritual body directly into the spiritual world. The thoughts in my heart may be presented by the special invisible here, and become the symbol of the secret. So I have interaction with the spiritual world, which naturally affects the choice of the road. Klein wondered, but he couldn't find the reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has flashed all kinds of thoughts in his heart, his body suddenly sinks and falls freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Klein still only saw the brightly superimposed color blocks and various symbols of the entities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the situation? He began to think about writing a letter asking Mr. Azick, or throwing the radio ticker on the fog, smeared with breath to contact the mirror Arodus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the self-floating, Klein suddenly moved his mind and slammed to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
