			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North District, Alka Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copsti Reid is sitting on the easy chair in the living room, with a fireplace burning in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a senior faculty member of the public school, he earns more than £4 a week, which is enough for a single person to live quite well, but he wears at home. There are a lot of patches on the clothes, and the cups on the table are very simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the wig, Copsti’s most striking is the towering cheekbones and the slightly chicken breasts – this is a kind of The deformed state of the sternum bulging forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a collection of poems written in Guvsak on his knees, but he hasn’t flipped a page for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copsti’s eyes were not blinded, and suddenly I heard someone smirking at the ear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very confused, you have not escaped, still stay at home, are you not afraid of the police coming to the door?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice is low and hoarse, Like a boy who is changing his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copsti stumbled and almost jumped from the easy chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly looked around and saw the sofa position a few steps away, I don’t know when I had sat in a figure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure is wearing a summer linen shirt and light trousers, and his face is stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, who are you? What are you doing?" Copsti asked the handrail and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who uses the illusion ability, leans back and holds his hands and opens his mouth leisurely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Last night, oh, it should be early this morning, I just saved you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save us?" Copthorne sees each other Not too malicious, a little relaxed, "You, you are the man in the woods? Have you solved the dead body that we wake up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking room He was quite cramped and showed obvious fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can sneak in when I am awake but unaware of it, I am sure I can’t resist it... Copstead’s heart flashed a similar idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are lucky enough, I just passed by, otherwise there will be a body in the ground, a body that has been bitten into pieces." Klein smiled. " Going back to our previous question, I am very curious. You dare to stay at home. Do you know what crimes you committed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is from Cop The performance before and after the "Resurrection Ceremony" by Stie confirms that the other party is a rookie. It is impossible to have the skill of hiding the true emotional color of the person. Therefore, I intend to find out the original reason only by asking the method of adding "Lingshi". Check it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I know, buying corpses privately and stealing other people’s graves, this is a crime that will allow me to go to jail for more than ten years, and, moreover, I am sure It will also be punished by the church." Copsti, who is less than 30 years old, took a breath and smiled bitterly. "However, as long as they don't make too many problems, the children and their parents will not tell me. Because they have done the same thing, even if they have reduced their sentence and surrendered their sentence, they will eventually go to jail for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Copthorne laughed at himself. A smile, "There are children who have told my parents about their identity. They are looking for a gang to warn me, let me resign within a week, away from school, I promised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Klein gently tapped his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a good thing to change the environment, of course, don’t do anything similar, and confuse the ignorant child is a great crime. Bad line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no more, I actually I think it would be so dangerous. I just watched them have the same hobbies as me. I wanted to teach them and lead them to find the mystery of eternal life. As for the dig of the grave, many doctors did it a long time ago." Quite sighed with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where did you learn 'spiritual dance'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ling dance? Ah, I call it death dance." Coptic is a first Hey, immediately realized, "This is an old gentleman who taught me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An old gentleman?" Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copsti stumbled upon his memories:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a tramp Because of serious illness, I fainted at my doorstep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't know that he was sick, thinking that he was just fainting, he helped him Go home, give him a hot towel, and apply medicated oil to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After he wakes up, let me not send him to the hospital or clinic, and mentioned Death is not the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I experienced the death of my parents and several relatives and was very interested in similar things, so I chatted with him and found He has profound knowledge and an amazing philosophy in this respect. He seems to be very satisfied with my curiosity. In the end, he even performed a miracle that killed a mosquito and awakened it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the beginning... I have seen at least ten similar novels in my life, all of them are good-hearted, the old grandfather who hangs up and go home, and then get the adventure... Ryan’s mouth twitched: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“So, have you left him at home?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Coptic Zheng focused on the following: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, if it is not enough time, I even want to be his student."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In those few days, he taught me death dance and taught me a lot of knowledge. Unfortunately, this time is too short. When I first entered the state, he died, leaving only one A copper whistle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not fallen, Coptic has produced a copper whistle that is not old and exquisite:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the piece."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have one...probably the ancestor... Klein spit out, Thoughtfully asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long ago was this? What did he look like? Where did you bury him?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Six months ago, his most obvious feature was the spot Hair plus erythema shot from the side, and he let me bury him in the back garden. "Copsti calculated the next date.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Mr. Azke, but the probability is a member of the spiritual group, the sequence may not be low... Ryan turned to ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to 'Ling Dance', you learned the 'resurrection ceremony'? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "That ceremony, I just learned half, can only be gradually improved based on scattered knowledge and folklore found, and improved again and again." Copstead replied very honestly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improved according to folklore? Hey, that poor black cat, may the goddess bless you... Klein Resist the urge to draw a blushing month on the chest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else? He asked one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, there is this copper whistle, I think it is the key to communicating the world outside the senses." Copstead raised his hand and sighed, "Every time I blow it, I feel that it is getting cold, I feel someone is watching me, I feel someone is pulling me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time he spoke, in the eyes of Kline, who was driving "Lingshi", the ground was wave-like, and the cold atmosphere filled with it. The fire and the lights were also dimmed. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a skull with three dead fish eyes, and a black, knot-like tentacle around the skull. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tentacle stretched out, sometimes touching Coptic’s legs, and sometimes pulling his clothes, it was quite impatient, but Cop Steve did not respond at all, and seemed to be unaware of it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Coptic looked excitedly at him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it felt? The surrounding area is getting cold! The gas light is also darkened!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really, someone is watching me, pulling me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messy messenger is working hard Touched Copsti, over and over again, but in the end, I still didn't receive the letter and reluctantly drilled back to the "ground." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s mouth squinted and whispered in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recovering what he said, he is not a dish, he is a lame of the dish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is not an extraordinary person at all!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that he was the kind of occultist just getting started. Now it seems that he hasn't found it anywhere..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;“The 'death' route to the 'collector' of sequence 9 can directly see ghosts and spirits...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with Copsti at the ceremony After using the bronze whistle to order the performance of the living body, Klein completely believed that he did not lie, could not help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he thought of a question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you write a note to the messenger just now Where will it go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real Spirits members? Senior members?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;According to this idea, Klein first said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It really became cold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After the response was completed, he quickly opened the subject: "Have you ever felt abnormal from the death of the old gentleman to the present?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ......I didn’t have it before, but in the last two weeks, I occasionally felt that someone around me could wake up like a corpse.” Copstead asked half of the fear and doubts. “Is this an illusion?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s in line with Yateru’s statement that he didn’t lie... Klein’s eye for Coptic’s gas field color, really reminded:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suggest you after In the month, go to the church at least three times a week to participate in the mass and listen to the prayer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't want to do this, you can book a grave for yourself." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." Coptilly responded with disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought it was a performance of his own progress! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it, using the commanding tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me to see that The body of the old gentleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Okay." Copthorne wanted to refuse, but instantly recognized the reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the tool and led Klein out of the back door of the kitchen, into the ruined garden, parked in front of a sloping tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stood by and watched Copsti skillfully dig the dirt and reveal the slate below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting the top layer, Copthorne used the tool to open the slate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slate is pressed against the mud that has just been dug out, and the tomb that is not so deep is sprinkled into the blushing moonlight that faintly penetrates the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copsti was consciously staring at him, suddenly screaming, stepping back a few steps and falling to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
