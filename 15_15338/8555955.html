			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The similar feeling is no stranger. The experienced Klein immediately controlled the facial expression and the slight tremor of the body with the help of the "clown" ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He softly but not hurriedly retracted his gaze, leaving the casual glimpse of the moment without revealing too many anomalies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, Talim is so young, he is not even married, no children." Klein sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he said this is because this sentence allows him to see a subtle reaction when the woman is given a reasonable explanation: from Talim A certain relationship of women associates with each other's marriage and family situation, and associates with a friend who died young, so he is not happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, in fact, at his age, he should be married four or five years ago, but unfortunately, his grandfather’s affairs left him extremely strong. The psychological shadow has always rejected marriage, until recently it has improved." Reporter Mike echoed and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the like-like normal Klein seems to have a bush of thorns deeply and slowly inserted into his skin and flesh, let his spirit Highly tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left-handed little girl in a black dress with a sapphire ring straightens her body and looks around in a circle, then accompanied by two maids, quietly left. The tomb of Talim gradually drifted away from the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of being stabbed behind him quickly became cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is she, why should she come to the tomb to offer flowers? Talim's lover? However, how can Talim, who has no money, no status, no status, has a relationship with a terrible person who is involved in a “0” seal or a demigod at the same level? This is not a novel! Moreover, it should be that she used the curse to kill Tallim... The water behind it is deep... Klein calmly listened to reporter Mike and surgeon Allen telling Tali’s past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly spread his mind and thought that the most confusing thing about this was:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The death of an ordinary person who has no money, no power, no identity, no status, no strength, and even a "0" seal or a strong person at the same level is incredible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not an isolated case, something similar is around me... Klein suddenly associates and looks to surgeon Allen: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ordinary person’s home is likely to have a sequence 1 "Silver Snake"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following this line of thought, Klein recalled the nearly five-month time that passed through, and suddenly found himself unconsciously and with many deities, many horrors The seal has a substantial involvement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman who killed Talim just now, "Silver of the Mercury" Will Anthony, "The Devil" Amon, the means of the Kingdom Museum Mysterious female, high-ranking strongman of the rose school, "0-08", "1-42", Ins. Zangweier, the variation of the sun's emblem, the Antignus family notes, suspected death descendants Mr. Azk. Aggs, Mr. "Gate", the twilight hermit will... One name flashes in Klein's mind, and every few ones makes him want to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sinks his mind and thinks carefully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not yet in these On the 'real creator' and 'eternal glory'... Strictly speaking, I can also rank into this rank. After all, it is due to black divination, and it is the soul of the world that has a strange fog... This is Luo The turmoil of another era after Searle, so half-god, horror seals will come into real life..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thoughts flashing, The depressed journalist Mike and the surgeon Allen have left the scene, and he left the cemetery without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he looked around and looked for a taxi, a familiar carriage drove out from the hidden place and stopped in front of him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently, the door is open, the old butler with the hair combed down, and the gesture of making a courtesy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness is waiting for you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Klein didn't have a half-drink and entered the spacious and warm compartment. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince Edessack is wearing a dark blue coat collar with a golden sash-like attire on his chest, which makes him look very noble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rubbed the diamond collar, and the narrow eyes had a few sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even when I attend a friend's funeral, I am restricted. I can't go directly to it. I can only go far and watch. I can only send people to give flowers for me. This is the royal family's freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "If Talim's grandfather did not lose the title, you should not have to avoid anything." Kline sat down opposite Prince Edsac's gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed Sach picks up the red-and-blooded Ormiller Wine Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哎I originally planned to find an opportunity to help Tallim’s father recover a certain title, but unfortunately...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went deep into the topic and asked: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock, have you received the parcel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." What did Klein ask? Answer nothing, never make too many descriptions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed Sack gently sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the progress?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used Taliem's ​​hair, flesh and blood and carry-on items to do a few divinations, but I came to the conclusion that he died of a sudden heart disease." Ryan’s smooth narrative with no emotions implies that “I am not high in sequence” and “I am limited in level”. “I am good at divination but the other party is more powerful.” “I definitely can’t investigate the truth”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edsack reveals an unspeakable disappointment and sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are you going to investigate?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Starting with people who have been in contact with Talme a few days before the death and where they have been.” Klein replied according to the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed Sack looked at the old housekeeper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is sure to inevitably interrogate and money Buying, um... investing Sherlock 100 pounds for investigation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, His Royal Highness the Prince." The old butler was ready to take out from his pocket. a stack of banknotes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you pay directly for £100? Klein once again felt the generosity of Prince Edessac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will work hard to investigate." He took the 100 pounds of cash and broke into his pocket, not counting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope we can let Talim rest in peace." Prince Edsac clenched his right fist and tapped his left chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he looked out the window and looked at the Crown Cemetery not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still had some friendship with Tallim... Klein secretly sighed and was led by the old butler to leave the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens, a luxury villa in the Earl of Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey looked at the long-haired and waist psychology teacher Isilante, pretending to watch carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately lowered the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isilant stunned and sipped for a few seconds: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go back and ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Good." Audrey responded briskly, just as it was just a matter of similarly interesting serial trading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Island retracts attention and says seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Audrey, although you Already the extraordinary person of sequence 8, but you have not received formal occult education, and many of the application skills of 'audience' and 'reader' are not well understood. From today, I will Guide you to become a truly extraordinary person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what I hope." Audrey said sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden-haired big dog Susie at her feet also happily swayed her tail, seemingly happy for the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who was determined to be passively absent, took the carriage and returned to the Ming 15 Sker Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the door and entered the house, just about to remove the hat, the action suddenly solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spiritual instinct tells him that a stranger has entered the living room and entered the room! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...has almost no cover... is it a warning? It’s better to have a warning than to have no warning... Klein stood in the hall and was silent for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he turned and went out to take the rental carriage to the steam church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This church towers over the chimney and bell tower. The former represents the power of steam, and the latter hangs complex clocks, symbolizing the beauty of machinery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, neither the weekend nor the noon and the evening, the believers in the church hall are praying quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat in the aisle position, leaned on the cane, took off his hat, and prayed for ten minutes in front of the sacred emblem in the forefront. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he took things and walked along the aisle to the altar, to the bishop who stood next to him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to confess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, God is watching you." Faces of kindness, the two pale bishops headed to the side Notice room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein followed closely and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat in a chair and crossed the board to the bishop:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I regret, I In the face of distress, I did not adhere to the principle and chose to withdraw."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was your idea at the time?" the bishop asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately took the death of Tallim, his doubts, the reminder of "the heart of the machine", the commission of Prince Edsac, and the divination After failing to get the answer, the original book was described once in the face of the royal family’s retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he did not look for Carlson directly was that he was not only being looked at by him but also being secretly observed by Prince Edsac, once it was clear With perfunctory and absenteeism intentions, there may be other difficulties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Steam Church is the headquarters of the Beckland Parish of the Church of Steam and Machinery, one of their three great sanctuaries, no one can peep here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein intends to use the steam church to convey his true ideas and avoid being involved in deeper conflicts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, follow the will of the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop is quiet and listens, and the tone is unchanged:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
