			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark room is covered with a thin layer of light red moon yarn, and everything is indistinct and not clear enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three men in black coats are sleeping in different places, and on the small sofa, Klein is half-baked in the night and looks closed. Into the sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dreams are gray and twisted worlds, sometimes flashing brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, these brilliances have become a picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a gloomy corner, the ground is flowing with sewage, the man with short brown hair, white shirt and brown vest is lying on the wall, surrounded by dense gray mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s lips were smashed in half, revealing slightly yellow teeth and rotten gums. His nose was only bloody, mixed with short hair. The flesh and blood on the face disappeared, and the white bones were clearly presented. A white, obese aphid drilled and drilled everywhere, and the throat was bitten. It seemed to be bitten by a beast. At least half of it is missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein reluctantly identified this as Zerrell Victor Lee, and the black and white photos he and Ian gave to the black and white photographs were no longer equivalent. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zherel is dead, and in a few days, it is estimated that there will be only bones left, and even the bones may not be complete... Klein is out of the dream Recalling the picture I just saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past experience has allowed him to see a similar body more calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking out the window of the blushing month, Klein thought for ten seconds and decided to try psychic, psychic to the black man next to the sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The corresponding "Amanda" pure dew and "Eye of the Eyes" potion, he has prepared a bottle in the preparation of the previous few days, As for the tranquil potion, Klein doesn't need it. He can keep calm and reason when others invade their dreams and force their spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arranging a simple altar and letting the quiet and tranquil scent spread out, creating a half-awake state, Klein turned to himself, A fool who does not belong to this age" makes a prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he entered the fog and responded with more than two-thirds of the spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I am promoted to Sequence 7, similar prayers should also be like the summoning and sacrifice rituals, slightly inciting the power of the mysterious space above the fog... Looking around, Klein made a rough judgment and quickly returned to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked through the starry sky and the chaotic and noisy thinking storm, entered the mental level of the target man, and saw the illusory figure floating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who sent you to Zeerel's house?" Klein glanced, and asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s vain eyes replied innocently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Merso, Mersault sent me to wait for a boy named Ian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light and shadow in his spiritual world changed, showing a skinny, darker complexion The man, the leader of the group of people who had been chasing Ian on the steam subway before Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really is him... Klein consumes too much spirituality in response to the petition, and at this point he has begun to feel tired and busy to ask for time: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is instructing Meerso?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know...he is our Zimmer No one can instruct him, except the boss, of the party’s 'inmates'.” The man said awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zmang...the word corresponding to the "warrior" in the plateau language...the pseudo-historian true occultist Klein’s head suddenly hurts and the body is involuntarily Just fly outside the storm of thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not rush to leave, methodically packed up the materials and short brown hair, opened the window of the convex window, let the cold night wind blow in, dispelling the taste of "Amanda" pure dew and "Eye of the Eyes" potion . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, Klein returned to the balcony, locked the door from the inside, and wiped all the places he touched. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Zerrell’s bedroom was restored to his previous state, he took a slap in the face of the three men who were still asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Straight up, Klein wears gloves, jumps and jumps agilely to the outside of the belly window, and on the toes, with an unusually small space Stand still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted the vertical latch up, blocked it with the tarot card, used the ability of the "clown", felt the details, adjusted the balance . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, Klein slowly pulled back the tarot card, and the vertical bolt was stable in place, not falling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swipe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first closed the half of the window without the bolt, then flashed over, the right hand jerked inward and the other half closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This movement is fast, so that the bolt will fall down until there is vibration, and it will be inserted into the matching iron hole precisely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! The sound that is difficult to eliminate sounds like a strong wind that hits the glass surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein knows that the three men in the bedroom will wake up slowly, no longer delay, and jump directly to the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The height of the second floor will not be a little dangerous for him now, but it will not be silent when landing, and it will not be obvious. The movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quickly left nearby and left Rose Street, but did not take the rental carriage back to Minsk Street in Jowood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned a few turns and headed for the immediate east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold night, the wind slammed into the bones, Klein shuddered, decided to add a sweater in the future, decided to buy in the next few days Charcoal, let the fireplace play its role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, without his map, he entered the Bakerland East by instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few gas lamps here, so you can see them one or two far away. If the dark clouds have not covered the red moon tonight, Klein believes that many roads will It can't be seen at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking and walking, he suddenly saw a pair of eyes in the deep darkness in front of him, and a figure of a ball was highlighted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They swayed from the blurry distance, silent, silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live? Klein slammed, and the detective held the "Requiem of the Soul" and the Tarot card, and quickly opened the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the color of the unhealthy and weak air field, and also saw the appearance of that figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are living people, normal living people, but the expression is numb, the eyes are empty, the movement is weak, there are men and women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s almost the morning, how are they still walking down the street... Klein’s doubts are on the side, crossing the crowd from the street, but very Fast, he encountered the second wave, the third wave, the same numbness contained pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned slightly, was about to ask, suddenly heard a scream in front of him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Get up! Give me up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You guys raised!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Streets and parks are not the place for you guys to sleep!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has had the same experience himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein breathed a sigh of relief and stepped forward to his one-bedroom house on Black Palm Street in the Eastern District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, he slept for two hours, initially recovered his spirituality, and then went out again, folding the withered branches as "Buddles." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The location of Zerrell's body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The location of Zerrell's body." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In and after divination, with the help of a short brown hair Ryan walked for a long time and went to the corner of the Eastern District, where there was a sewer entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- After the plague 12 years ago, the Kingdom of Lun gradually established an advanced sewer system in the capital, surpassing the Republic of Intis in one fell swoop. Russell Heritage." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removing the lid, Klein held his breath and climbed down the vertical metal ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is not a special clothing, no pockets, no too many items, he abandoned the "Crag oil" learned from Frye. The "Crag's Oil", which refreshes the mind and eliminates the odor, is regretted at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten seconds, Klein landed on the ground and felt the thickness of the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dirty feelings provoke a fine shackle in his arms and body, but he can only be patient, continue to walk forward, in the air Walk forward in a quiet sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a road ahead, one of which is relatively hidden, with a thicker smell that is more disgusting than other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned to the end, and when he reached the end, he saw the dense spiritual light and the color of the gas field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the use of candles, he opened the eyes of the vision, directly reflecting the gloomy corner, reflecting the rotten, smashed Rotten corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly the same as the picture he saw in the dream divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吱! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray, densely packed mice fled, but some remained in place, refused to leave, and could not bear food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that Zeerel, Klein quickly hesitated to set up a psychic ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well... If Ian’s description is no problem, Zerel’s death will be a few days, and “Psychic” should be able to harvest certain, superficial information... ...he thought with confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the wind swirling, with the establishment of the spiritual wall, the mice all fled, and Klein performed the ceremony step by step, as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The death of Zerrell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The death of Zerrell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and over again, Klein’s eyes turned black, no pupils, no see With a white eye, he quickly entered the dream with meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the foggy illusory world, nothing is presented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein opened his eyes and made a frowning judgment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Psychic failure ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone's handling the spirit of Zeerel..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
