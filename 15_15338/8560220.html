			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quieted for a few seconds, Klein stepped forward, stepped on the ladder, and carefully walked down the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light around it is gradually dimmed, only the gray color shrouds the quiet world. The more the Klein goes down, the more it is locked into the dark. The feeling of the dark silent room, the ear can slowly hear the sound of his blood flowing and the powerful heart jumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter is getting faster and faster, a little bit of anxiety and panic that is hard to contain, and Klein is busy converging, looking at the cascading light balls to calm the mood Restore status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His side, on behalf of the gray-white cliffs in the subconscious area of ​​Grosell, stands cold and chills, but it seems to die, but the gray around it will flash from time to time. A light spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stared at it, and saw from one of the spots the Grosse who was tearing open the mouth of the human plug and the horrified Grosser, at that time, The latter is less than 3 meters and is clearly still in its infancy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light flashed over and there was a dusk of the peaks, and the time seemed to be slow here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is looking for more valuable information in Grosell's subconscious, and the sound of the beast breathing in the ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After brushing, a huge palm was found in the surrounding gray, it was gray-blue, covered with decaying traces, with a distinct yellow Green liquid, the action quickly caught Klein's ankle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the voice of the Dutch, the lower steps, the same palms are grabbed one by one, as if to force Klein’s spirit Into the soul world is the most secluded and most difficult to measure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, these rotten palms are like the sea, dense, constantly struggling to stretch up and send out a horrible gasp that can make people feel roots The Klein instinct jumped up and jumped three steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the countless palms of the giant body did not stop, on the surface of the ladder, the tides squirmed upwards, drowning every inch of space below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is about to explore the right palm, take the "the death knell", to purify the bullets with "killing" to solve this group of unclear "monsters", in my mind Suddenly flashed two questions: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do these "palms" come from? Why is it in Grosell's subconscious? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is a moment, the inspiration is strong, Klein vaguely understands something, immediately give up the use of "the death knell", calmly breathe, and see the light ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only rotten giant palm rushed to his feet and grabbed his crotch and calves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, they disappeared silently and never seemed to have appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, this is the illusion that I was influenced by Grosell’s subconscious mind. Here, the mind and the mind not only directly 'face' but also blend with each other. If there is no corresponding extraordinary ability, the deeper it is, the more likely it is that the emotional collapse will be eroded by the other party's subconscious. The final 'mental body' is seriously polluted, and the whole person becomes a mentally ill person who cannot recover rationality, and this is likely It will lead to loss of control... This is not the same as psychic. It is not to stay awake and rational to avoid being polluted, because it is already inside the target 'mental body'..." Klein silently and consciously realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hesitated for a few seconds, turned his body, climbed up the ladder, no longer went deep into Grosell’s spiritual world, because he lacked to appease his own soul. Extraordinary ability, strong support for the down is equal to suicide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After collecting the magical items in this area, consider the issue of continuing exploration." Klein determined the idea, the faster and faster, and finally jumped Back to the dream of Grosell, he returned to the place where the "Giant Wang Ting" guards lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has felt exhausted, immediately left the dream, walked out of the blacksmith's shop in Grosse, and once again examined the singularity of the world in the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the previous speculation that the deceased will be "reborn" and become a new character, then Klein will not need to worry about anything, but if the latter, he will have to reduce the frequency of exploring the world in the book, and strictly control each time. The time of stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't judge at the moment, first respond to the latter situation, and caution is always right..." Klein quickly decided to return to the gray Above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw a familiar figure again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-eyed blue-eyed Longzel sits on a long wooden bench by the street, staring blankly at the sky as if it had been burnt, as if contemplative . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that the former ruin of the former Lun soldier is on his own hands, ready to be sent back to Bakerland’s Storm Church Cemetery, Klein sighs silently Going over, sitting next to Longzel, ask in a chat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you thinking?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am thinking, who am I, where do I come from, and where should I go back..." Longzel did not regain his gaze and said with a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for Klein to ask again, he shook his head and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I always feel I don't belong here, not myself, there is a place waiting for me to go back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They laughed at me always thinking about these useless questions, so give me I took the nickname of a 'philosopher'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;talking, he looked at the falling sunset, once again fell silent and screamed out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not speak, sat quietly there, accompanied Longzel to see the setting sun, and then disappeared silently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longzel did not notice that the people around him had left, like a marble statue, looking far away, for a long time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the replenishment, Alger Wilson commanded the "Blue Avenger" to leave the rebel private port, not too much in the Rothde Islands stop留.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has to return to Paso Island during the specified time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, In the captain's room, he was looking forward to the illusory door of spirituality and expanded candlelight on the altar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the gate of sacrifice. It is also the door to accept the gift!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the illusion of illusion, the mysterious door slowly opens, revealing the endless depth and darkness inside.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light bursts from the inside, and immediately converges. When everything is calm, there are two more items on the altar. I don’t know when the door is full of strange symbols.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger was very calm and thanked Mr. Fool, and ended the ceremony in accordance with the process before reaching out to pick up the two items on the altar.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them is a neatly folded piece of paper, one is a transparent "Jellyfish" wrapped in azure water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger first examined the latter and found that there were occasions when the wind blew the whirlpool, sometimes there was a flash of silver and white, and sometimes a long-distance song came out. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This voice has a feminine feeling... It seems that the owner of this feature is a lady." Alger could not help but sigh, because it means not Which quasi-high-level member of the Storm Church was killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Storm Church has no female quasi-high-level and high-level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting the extraordinary characteristics of the "Sea Singer", Alger unfolds the paper, skips the main material column, quickly scans the auxiliary materials, and finally looks at Parked in the ceremony section. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, there are already extraordinary characteristics, what is the main material is completely unimportant, you can look at it later, and the auxiliary materials are relatively easy to collect. Type, don't need to care too much, only ritual, is the most important thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
