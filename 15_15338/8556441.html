			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to see Klein’s eyes is the altar that surrounds the radiance and the tall and thin figure that stands on the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure removed the hood, revealing a beautiful demon like a female face, the left chest, shoulders, abdomen, thighs are covered with creeping Thick and disgusting flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around him, the light layer is filled with illusory and transparent figures, filled with numbness, despair, pain, depression and other feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And outside the altar, the four figures of the previous prayers have fallen, their skin is dry, tightly wrapped around the bones, like a body that has been weathered for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the entire hall, a glimpse of the brilliance penetrates the void, along with stone pillars, floors, and air filled with symbolic symbols and magical signs. The altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just came out of hiding, Mr. A opened his eyes and looked at his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His pupils are stained with blood, and there is extreme madness in indifference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other extraordinary people, I am afraid that I have been subconsciously removed my eyes and I dare not look at it, but Klein has faced the "eternal glory" and has seen it. "Monster of the gods" Amon, there is no fear of this, calmly pull the trigger, let a silver "hunting bullet" inscribed with many patterns spurt out and rush to the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. A, who witnessed this scene, subconsciously wanted to raise his hand, but eventually stopped, indifferently watching the silver bullets drill into the light layer around the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uninterrupted, the "Hunting Bullet" full of patterns melted in the radiance of the cascading, disappeared, and was reluctant to be counted by the hard-to-find Negative emotions are engulfed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, it was completely broken down, leaving no trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s eyelashes, slammed, and shot all the remaining bullets in the revolver, pale gold “purified bullets”, brass In the color, the "exorcism bullets" that bloomed in Jinmang were connected end to end, and they penetrated into the light layer around the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they also disintegrated, disappeared, and failed to make the slightest flaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. A smirked and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Useless, little reptile, ceremony already Officially started, your strength cannot be broken and interrupted, even the extraordinary ones of the sequence 5 can't do it!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you are lucky too, you Will live to witness the coming of my Lord and into His body. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Mr. A ignored Klein and closed his eyes again. It seems that the other party is really just a small bug.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Shepherd" raised his hands and raised his arms, and shouted in ancient Hermes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The Lord who created everything;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The dominating behind the shadows; (Note 1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The fall of all living beings." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your devout believer prays for your coming;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing to give my body, Let it be a container and take on your great will! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the prayer, Mr. A’s head shines from the unknown, completely covering him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The unwillingness of the adult shadows and the negative emotions of the depositions flooded into Mr. A.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰,砰,砰!< Bryan /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein even slammed the fingers and manipulated the flames, trying to attack the altar, but they still irresistibly broke down in the surrounding light layer, extinguished, melted, No effect at all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, regardless of the sun brooch, the biotoxin bottle, the all-black eye, or the "black emperor" card that only enhances the personality, it seems that it is impossible to break through the barrier of the altar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you just wait for Miss Justice to find the reinforcements in time? Or watch the "real creator" come? Klein's spirit is tense, his thoughts fly, and he quickly thinks about what countermeasures he can have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He filtered the contents of his body in one piece, and his palms did not consciously pull out the cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, he thought of something! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to consider the consequences, he reached into his pocket and grabbed a metal-filled item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stepped forward a few steps, slamming his arm and throwing the item in his palm and throwing it at the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brass-colored glow, the item entered the laminated light layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a quaint key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the "master key." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light layer, the brass "master key" began to decompose and began to melt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when its outer shell is gone, the curse inside it appears directly, connecting the unknown "Mr." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens, a luxury villa in the Earl of Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey stood by the floor-to-ceiling window and looked at the distance with anxiety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw the fog on the horizon gradually thickening, the yellowish tinted iron black, and slowly rendered in the direction of her own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a bit wrong." Jin Mao big dog Su Shi is next to her, also looking at the usual haze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I hope I can stop it... Audrey is not sure what the fog means, just silently praying to the goddess and the "fool" in his heart, asking them Don't let the "original witch" come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she noticed that the branches outside the window began to shake and the glass shook slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The wind is coming..." Audrey feels inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joewood District, Holy Wind Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a horrible storm that is visible to the naked eye, and then an unimaginable hurricane is swaying toward the east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deposited mist was blown away, and the rich yellow and iron black quickly faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dry branch fell to the ground, dust and dirt rose in the air, as the fog went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many pedestrian hats have left their heads, and the body has to shake to hold trees or walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors in the dock area seem to have returned to the port city and are witnessing a typhoon attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoke in the eastern and factory areas is weakened, and the mild discomfort of healthy people is alleviated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! Bang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning jumps, thunder blows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They quickly subsided, and the rain began to clean the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it was destroyed in time, according to her estimation, the "haze" just now can directly cause more than 20,000 deaths, and there is a spread of plague. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, my potion is also digested almost, but this is only a matter of harvest... The traces of a large number of people missing will be erased, pointing to the aurora Yes, pointing to the "real creator", no one can guess what the royal family really wants to do... I should leave, take away Terry... Desperate lady is thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her whereabouts is hidden and handled beforehand, so she is not worried about being blocked by Beckerland’s demigods for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the other party finds the trace, she is far from the city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the desperate lady was ready to leave the carriage, she saw a figure in front of her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure sits across from her, is a young woman, dressed in a classical robes with a hood, black eyes and hair, beautiful but sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After throwing out the "master key", Klein took it again. Azick copper whistle, then hold his breath and wait for the result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If his concept is not realized, the barrier of the altar is still not broken, then he will use the Aziz copper whistle to see if he can get the "message" "s help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more, he will enter the fog, move out the "Black Emperor" cards and other items, try every possibility, fight to the last second! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, in the afternoon, there is no blushing month, let alone the clear full moon, so Klein lacks enough curse on the "master key". Confidence, only hope that the dissolution of the altar barrier threatens its existence and allows it to react instinctively, such as the reverse communication of "Mr." and the transmission of His help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a second or two, Klein saw the "master key" decomposed into the tiniest light particles and a illusory twisted blush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blush is struggling in the rapid fade, and it bursts open! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Klein lost his hearing and saw the resentment in the light layer and the innumerable figures that were unwilling to turn into a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They change quickly, they are dark green, they grow a second brain, the third eye, or the fifth leg...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They merged into a torrent and poured into Mr. A’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mr. Horan opened his eyes, and the indifferent blood was a horror that he could not believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the light layer around the entire altar was distorted and collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge explosion spread out from the center of the altar and set off a horrible storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! The last four large stone pillars were broken instantly, and Klein in the distance had only had time to make a rolling action, and he was shot by the shock wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hit the wall, flattened, and turned into thin paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin paper was quickly shredded by subsequent wind waves and sprinkled around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein himself emerged in the corner, using walls to counter the storms caused by the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The destruction effect of the "Master Key" manufacturing is beyond his imagination! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse that was forcibly ablated did have an instinctive reaction, passing the shout of Mr. Gate, and the at least angel-level exile The sound polluted the ritual needs of resentment and numbness, so the altar lost balance and went to the path of self-destruction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
