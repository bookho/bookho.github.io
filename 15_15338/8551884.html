			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned to the captain’s office and saw the door open, and Dunn Smith leaned back against the back of the chair and sniffed the pipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ash, Dunn changed his position:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your state is very good, It’s not like just taking a potion.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This may be the benefit of a thorough digestion and promotion.” Klein closed the door and opened the chair. under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Dunn both know that "playing the law" can be freed from the relevant issues without being bound by the oath, but at this time the two have no tacit understanding. To mention this matter, I was silent when I asked for a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it, and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is your Sesima left? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, as a senior deacon, he has other things." Dunn sighed for a few seconds. "Well, he took away the old." The pair of red eyes left by Neil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein asked strangely and slyly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den took the coffee and took a sip, silently for a long time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can't deceive ourselves. The out-of-control team has actually become a monster, and I told you that after the monster dies, there will be some things that are enriched with extraordinary power. If these things are uncontrollable and have various problems, then they must be Seal, um, this is one of the sources of seals, and the rule inside the night is that the items left by the out-of-control team are kept off-site and avoid stimuli to his companions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbs p; "Understandable rules." Klein took a slightly heavy head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he was keenly aware that the captain had just missed a possibility, so he asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If the 'monster' is left behind, the enrichment of the extraordinary power can be controlled?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun looked at him, the gray eyes were quiet It seems to be the quietest night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't want to know the answer."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein stunned and suddenly realized a possibility:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normal monsters will be left behind Extraordinary materials are used to modulate the corresponding potions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the monster that the loser becomes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the things they left behind are controllable, will they be treated as extraordinary materials...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein suddenly had a strong nausea, could not help but retching a few times, and the line of sight became blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a chilly guess... but it’s very likely to be close to the real answer! In a flash, he had a deeper understanding of the words "in order to resist the abyss, must bear the corrosion of the abyss" "is the guardian, but also a group of poor pests against the dangers and madness." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this one of the reasons why the church conceals "playing the law"? A certain degree of recycling? But this will make the high-level itself also deviate from the church... Kline’s heart clearly reflects his changing face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his reaction, Dunn suddenly smiled, and some of the light in the ashes was flashing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can think about the good things, our companions have changed the way to accompany us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are always with us. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, Dunn bowed his head, took the coffee, and got to his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another ten seconds of silence. He leaned back and raised his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;“And you can rest assured that as long as we can collect extraordinary materials from normal sources, we will not do the things you want.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the regulations, you can get a day off when you are promoted, and you should not practice fighting in the afternoon, but you must find someone to tell Gao Wen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Klein nodded lightly, took a deep breath, and straightened his back: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, I have finished the occult course, I want to The morning time is used to learn the skills of tracking, monitoring, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and added a serious expression:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to fulfill the duty of the night as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun looked at him deeply and said:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are more tough than I thought, then do what you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Captain "Kleinho Get up, chest drew Crimson months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving Blackthorn Security, Klein did not go home directly to rest Instead, take this opportunity to take the trackless public carriage to the Azick faculty's home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang, Dangdang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the crisp bells, Azke in a white shirt and black vest opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The button of his vest has a gold bracelet with a diagonal slant hanging there, connected to the pocket watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to work?" Azk looked at the sky and found that the sun had not climbed to the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of some special circumstances, I was scheduled to take a break," Klein explained slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azk looked at him as if he had seen something and nodded and let the road open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the foyer, Klein put his cane, took off his hat, and followed Azker all the way to his living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living room is decorated with a fireplace, rocking chair, sofa and coffee table, and Klein sat in a familiar position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite Azke smiled and pointed to the cigar on the coffee table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Klein resolutely shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azk did not persuade him to take care of himself, pick up a cigar to warm up, and ask at random:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is things handled in Morse Town?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This must be thank you." Ryan said sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he silently spoke in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Azick, at Before you lose your memory, you must have left a lot of wealth for yourself. Otherwise, a faculty member who is not even an associate professor can enjoy cigars often? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party focused on the opportunity to play with cigars, he volunteered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Azick I have one thing I would like to ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Azk asked without looking up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slowed down and organized the language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My colleague got out of control , became a monster, I want to know if his soul is also polluted?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not sure whether Mr. Azke understands the meaning of losing control, so prepare After the corresponding explanation and description, I will wait for the other party to ask questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azke stopped his movements, raised his head and looked at Klein, focusing on the head: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is no doubt."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a similar situation, you have to discern carefully. If the direct cause of his loss of control is the temptation of a demon or a demon, try to avoid psychic, which is likely to give you Brings a fatal danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Klein gave a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of his home, he was not stable enough, he forgot the psychic, and Dunn Smith did not remind him that he missed the opportunity completely. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To think about it now, the captain did not forget, but deliberately did not mention... Kline was thoughtfully silent for a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not entangle the matter and referred to the previous encounter:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Az Mr. Ke, I tried to divinate the source of the haunted incident in the town of Morse, and saw a pyramid tomb that stood upside down. My companion told me that this is a symbol of death and that his descendants can get it. The glory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azko just put down the match, picked up the cigar cutter, and suddenly squatted there, for a long time no action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat back and leaned against the back of the sofa, his expression agglomerated abnormally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he opened his mouth slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is familiar to me. Feeling, but it didn't remind me of more things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately." Klein sighed sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that he could further awaken Mr. Azick’s memory with the revelation gained from that divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick cuts the cigar cap and shakes his head and smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it's very easy Recalling the old things, I think I have found a way to get rid of fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I must be grateful to you, thank you for always remembering me. "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I will Leaving Tingen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Klein asked recklessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not good to find out the black hands behind me who are influencing my destiny and stealing your child's skull? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick took a cigar and sighed and explained:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The target may have noticed my Concern and tracing, there has been no movement during this time, so I have no clues. Therefore, I intend to leave Tingen temporarily and go to Bakerland. On the one hand, I will take the opportunity to find the traces left before I lost my memory. , let the target relax and be vigilant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, Mr. Azick’s latest amnesia is near the University of Beckland... Unfortunately, there is no way to replace me. Check out the red chimney house... Klein Zheng focuses on the following: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will pay close attention to this matter, once the target has acted, it is exposed, immediately Notify you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Mr. Azick, how can I notify you in time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In Klein’s thoughts, if Azick is a descendant of death or has some connection with death, then his power type should Close to "human corpses" sequence, there must be a way to come up with something like "Dai Lixin make" things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, this can prove from the side whether Azick is related to death and whether it belongs to his descendants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick took a cigar and thought about it for a dozen seconds and untied a piece of jewelry from the left cuff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a delicate, old copper whistle with many exotic patterns that make it full of mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
