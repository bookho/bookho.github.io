			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, in the palace of the giant residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moon" Emlin seriously thought about the history of the blood family to Mr. "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and the ancestor are old friends, and they must know very well about the events before the Cataclysm. I don’t need to repeat them... In the Quaternary and the Fifth Age, the blood Glory is not uncommon, there are too many history worth telling, but the most important and most crucial is only one point... Emlin quickly got the idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his current cognition, the "fool" is probably the ancient god before the Cataclysm, for some reason, no fall, sleep so far, and Gradually recovering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good explanation of why in the long history of the millennium, the bloody clan’s record never appeared in a similar hidden existence until the other’s name suddenly Spread it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the discretion, Emlin straightened his back:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the Cataclysm, The blood family left the center of the historical stage of the North and South continents and became the aristocrats of different empire of different empire as individuals, not ethnic groups, or governed a territory, or guarded the castles in key areas.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Wait until our Queen, lead us out of the dark ages, the 'Queen of the Blood Moon', Olnia, became the wife of the Emperor of the Tennessee Empire, and the whole blood family will gather together and become an important support of this dynasty. At that time, Rue's Augustus, Fossack's Einhorne must respectfully call our Queen as the Queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In those days, Queen Ornia was a symbol of beauty. If there is a mirror that can answer questions, then the answer is 'who is the most beautiful woman in the world'. It can only be her..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin said that the more proud, the more proud he is, the more he has changed from being cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirror that answers the question, isn't this the Arrodes? I don't know if there is any member of the "Mechanical Heart" who has a painful pain. Come to the last sentence, "The Mirror Mirror tells me who is the most beautiful woman in the world"... What kind of answer will Arrods make? ? Klein's sitting posture has not changed, his mouth is smiling, his thoughts are divergent thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After saying a bunch, Emlin’s expression turned serious:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything was shattered in the Battle of the Four Emperors, the night emperor fell, the Queen fell, and the blood family suffered a heavy blow, and after winning the final victory, the Seven Gods supported Augustus and Einhorn. The four nobles of Sauron and Castilla divided the empire and destroyed the royal family that lacked the high-ranking people. Our blood family can only retreat into the deep mountains of no one, and hide in the dark corners to keep the continuation of the ethnic group."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am almost as expected... Seven gods, "The Battle of the Four Emperors" is already the Seven Gods... Klein thought of the statue of the six gods in the underground remains of the Tujia family . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, when the seven gods split and the four countries attacked each other, we finally got rid of the embarrassment after paying a certain price." At this time, Emlin Rare spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Klein Road with a gaze:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, Do you still have time to listen to me about the life story of the 'Queen of the Blood Moon' and the glory that the blood family once had? It is a heavy book composed of a glorious page, and I can repeat each part."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that you can still talk about one day and one night... I used to think that you are a vampire who likes dolls. I don’t know too much about history. I don’t think you are so professional and so academic. ... No wonder you always think that the blood family is noble, and therefore proud... This kind of guy who doesn't like to go out, has an interest in what field, really does in-depth research, and the life of the vampire is long enough... Klein After considering it, I am prepared to reject the good intentions of Emlin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is not interested in those history, but time does not allow him to listen to each other's long story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough is enough." Klein smiled slightly. "I like the exchange of equivalents. It won't let you make a statement without any gains. When you have a chance, you will Use the corresponding history to exchange what I want from me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...OK." Emlin was still a little lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time he has had the opportunity to tell the glory of the blood family to other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal times, in order to hide his identity, he can’t show off this with humans, and inside the blood family, he knows everything, and he’s not responsible for the newborn. education. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein no longer said more, regaining a condescending attitude:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, you Go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White had a crimson glow in his eyes and swallowed him quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief dizziness, he found himself still sitting in the rental carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he saw the illusory parchment and gained knowledge of how to pray for help from the "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was free at noon, I returned to my home and immediately held a ceremony. Please ask Mr. Fool to lift my psychological suggestion... Emlin suddenly felt a little excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the carriage arrived at the Harvest Church, he calmed down and gave the fare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the church, seeing the Utravsky bishops preaching for only a few believers, he is no longer as distressed as usual, his heart is quite relaxed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this state, he inexplicably thought of something:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Uttraski It seems that I have never stopped me from finding a way to relieve my psychological cues... What is he thinking about...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East District, a greasy coffee shop in the desktop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When arriving at the scheduled time, Klein enjoys the oatmeal with pea stewed lamb broth and listens to old Kohler telling the news he has collected in the last week. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is not much intelligence in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the other party finished, Klein thought about it and pulled out the two-dollar bill, pushing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have already given it!" Old Kohler was shocked and waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein chuckles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will go to the South for a holiday this week, After a hard year, it’s time to take a break.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I may have to come back in two weeks and three weeks, so pay your salary in advance, huh, don’t forget Help me collect the news. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, good! Old Kohler took the paper money with joy and gratitude.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, he has already thought about how to spend the New Year.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intends to buy the marinated ham that he was reluctant to buy and use it to match his own bread.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't wait... Thanks to Moriatti detective! He didn't swallow his mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein picked up his hat and thought about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should be aware of it, and there has been some chaos in the East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't let yourself take risks in order to inquire about the news. If you find something wrong, dodge it immediately, don't mix it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The matter surrounding Prince Edsack made him worry, so he thought about reminding Old Kohler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Old Kohler took his own chest. "I am very timid, I will not take risks."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Klein praised. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately remembered the pulping woman Liv and her two daughters who loved to read and hope to change their destiny, Frya and Daisy, said indulge: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You pay attention to the Liv family, don't let them be bullied, if there is a riot in the Eastern District, take them to a safe place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Riot... Are you referring to the workers' struggle?” Old Kohler asked inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost." Klein responded vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the limit he can reveal, otherwise it is easy to be suspected by people or seals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room with large and small dolls, 趁 noon time back At home, Emlin White sat in a chair and enjoyed the dim caused by the curtains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and shook his fist:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on for me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he turned to find spiritual material and began to write the name of the "fool" and the corresponding symbol and magic logo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he was busy, he tried the ceremony and the spirit gradually dispersed, as if he had come to an infinite height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vagueness, he saw countless shadows that were difficult to describe, and saw seven lines of light that seemed to contain a lot of knowledge, and saw the gray above the stilts. Fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the boundless fog, there is an ancient palace that cannot be seen. There is a shadow in the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Emlin saw a majestic and sacred golden figure, and saw the black wings behind the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t had time to count how many pairs of mysterious wings, and he feels that he is flying up and coming into contact with the golden figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He screamed and rolled his head around his body. There were bursts of blue smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Emlin only eased down and heard the low voice of "The Fool" echoing in his ear:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your psychological cues have been lifted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the feeling of dispelling psychological cues? It’s really painful... Emlin sat on the floor, gasping for a big breath, and his neatly groomed hair was cluttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the fog, Klein nodded thoughtfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sure enough, the purification and dispersal effect of the 'sun brooch' will simultaneously harm the vampire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already calculated in advance, removing the "sunshine" that the weakened psychological suggestion needs Not enough to hit Emlin, too lazy to change to a complicated approach, now it seems that the results are consistent with expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing this matter, Klein took off the citrine pendant in the left wrist cuff and divined for the next attempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is appropriate to go to the Red Rose Manor this afternoon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven times, he opened Eyes, seeing the spirit swing still there, no rotation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involving a “0” seal or the corresponding strong, the divination is too difficult to get effective revelation... Klein sighs roughly . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, he will be divined for tomorrow afternoon whether it is appropriate to go to the Red Rose Manor, again harvesting the results of the failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always said that divination is not a panacea, and now it is confirmed... I have to make my own decision... This step must go out, otherwise there is no way not to People perceive the stage and turn into the scenes... The sooner the better, the delay, or the possibility that it is impossible to clean up... Klein has a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately returned to the real world, put on a double-breasted long dress, put on a half-high silk hat, and walked out of Minsk Street, 15 Red Rose Manor of Prince Dessac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
