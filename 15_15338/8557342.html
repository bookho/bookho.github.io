			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there something to ask the captain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz frowned and watched Gelman Sparo leave the room, not knowing what the other party really was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this guy pursuing? Money, wealth? But he has time to have the opportunity to take away 'Steel' McVetti and 'Bloody Thorns' Terry’s head was replaced by a reward of nearly 10,000 pounds. The amount was reduced. There was also a seven or eight thousand pounds. But he did not do this, and he also generously divided my spoils. This is very contradictory. He heard me In the "flame", the first reaction pointed to a reward of 3,000 pounds... According to the captain, this is unscientific...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did he deliberately give up the bounty? What? Unless... unless he has a better way to get it safer, or who is it reserved for? Um... He has prepared for the emergence of the ‘damper’ in advance... He has his own network of contacts and intelligence channels! In this way, everything is explained! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adding to the half-god that killed Qilingers, hey, there is a hidden and powerful behind Gelman Spalo. Organization!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz was scared by his own speculation, and instinctively wanted to express this feeling in body language, and forgot that the left arm was still fractured. Suddenly, I was sore and grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him more and more scared and didn’t want the captain to meet such a crazy guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even suspected that the real purpose of German Sparrow was the captain’s 26,000 pounds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are singled out, the madman may not have won the captain, and we have mate, second, third and several sailors, but behind him There is a terrible organization! To hurt the captain, unless you cross over my body! Daniz raised his chest and raised his neck, full of self-sacrificing sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and took care of his hair, long and whispered, saying to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Re-observation, maybe Gellman Sparo really just want to ask something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously took a circle and found out The flying carpet and the shadow cloak are all there is no missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, Gilman Sparo left all the things that belonged to me, and he was not afraid of me taking the opportunity to escape? Or, he secretly sneaked Take my hair, easy to divination?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, he is a crazy guy, even if he wants to use his hair, he will come straight and reach out. Root, it is impossible to sneak up and do it... Yes, there is a strong and secret organization behind him! Maybe, maybe this time, there are people in that organization who monitor me in secret, waiting for me to leave, waiting for me to find the captain... insidious! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German Sparo must have deliberately went out!" Daniz felt that he had grasped the truth of the matter with his experience and wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a few steps back and forth and sat back on the easy chair, silently laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not leaving!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to see what you really want to do! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not bring the danger to the captain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 3 pm, Westem Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also part of the Rothschild Islands, but it is the farthest from the "generous city" of Baiam, which takes nearly five hours to reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein purchased a set of local specialties on the way, and bought a small suitcase to replace the clothes, a total of 14 Sule, not To 1 pound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really cheap, that’s a fraction of the dress...wearing wide-leg pants, a thick brown jacket, and a light brown cap, Klein’s topless The local face, walked down the passenger liner, and entered some of the old ports of Symi Island - spending time buying clothes, changing the image, he missed the 9 o'clock ferry, only 10 o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about the expenses of this play, he couldn’t help but count his current financial situation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The 'no face' feature sold for 3,825 pounds, and the pirate bounty of 3,000 pounds. Although the 6825 pounds have not yet been obtained, as long as the 'inverted man' is not exposed, it can basically be included in the budget...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Donna, their thanks to Jin Jia for the rest of the money, there are 255 pounds...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "'Steel' Maviti found 26 pounds 11 Sule 8 pence...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, there are 5 "ballast" gold coins ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t spent much money lately, and it’s a total of £1. It’s really a pleasant thing...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, I will have 7,110 pounds, and there are more extraordinary characteristics of 'nightmare', the fisherman's jealousy, the value is not low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think about this, I earned an extraordinary character of 3,000 pounds and 'live corpse', the latter 3,000 to 5,000 pounds, that is to say The income is seven or eight thousand pounds... This is just a 'steel' Mavitica's 'Bloody Thorns' Huntley and Scull, and wasted a lot... hunting pirates is a good job and can uphold justice. Punish sin, protect the weak, and get rich overnight..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned his head and looked to the side, only to see the color of the sea here than Baiyam There is a lot of clearness there, and the whole is like a green, huge, crystal-clear gem, reflecting the golden glow of the sun in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, generation after generation of adventurers go out to sea to find wealth, it is not unreasonable, even if the residual spirituality of the ancient grievances is deducted, the eyes of the six-winged gargoyles, Su The auxiliary materials of the "Grand Master" of the springs of Niagara Springs, the rest of the money can also make me here, in Desi Bay, in the colonies of the South Continent, in the non-metropolitan area, buy a fairly good The manor... Lun’s rural scenery is said to be very beautiful. If you really can’t go back, you can consider a similar place to settle... Well, I still have 10% of the Beckland Bike Company’s shares, and the return will not be low... ...Kline with a sigh of relief is thinking straight ahead about the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a boundless imagination, Klein began to consider a more realistic question, that is, the extraordinary characteristic of "nightmare" is to sell, or to find opportunities to return to the night church, or Crafted into craftsmen, made into magical items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the situation, the best plan is to sell to the church... The "dereliction of duty" Klein who has gone away with the two potions of the night is not sure Thinking about it. At the same time, he hopes that the small "sun" will reach Sequence 7 as soon as possible and is qualified to contact the method of removing the extraordinary characteristic mental pollution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for releasing the "light priest" in the glove, he is not in a hurry. The small "sun" just got the potion recipe of sequence 7, for the time being There is no need, I have to wait for a long time, and the ability of the "Light Priest" is very effective against the "blood thief" gang of pirates, much stronger than the "sun brooch". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking slowly, Klein entered the port town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are basically local races, the skin is near bronze, the black hair is naturally micro-volume, and the body exudes a long-lasting smell of dealing with spices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change the appearance, ask the situation of Rui Ni and whether there is a death message from Winter. After returning, Klein found a secluded corner and wiped his face with his hand. I turned myself into a very deep, thin and tall Winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carried the suitcase and went around the town to the suburbs and saw the winery of the Rui Ni family<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl with linen hair can't be called a girl, and it is obviously mature compared with Wenter's memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is cleaning the door, no one around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein took a deep breath and spit out slowly, feeling that his heart was full of embarrassing emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a keyboard powerhouse, he knows the doctrines of the method, experience, etc., but lacks further understanding, can only try to figure out the temperature of this scene. Special mood and performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, his eyes closed and went over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rinnie heard the footsteps, looked up and saw the visitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her mouth was slightly open, and she made a half-sounding "ah" sound, and immediately slammed her face: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you suddenly run back?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, you are just performing... Klein reveals a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am coming to say goodbye to you ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used the local dialect and brought a few nondescript Bayam accents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The language of the Rothde Islands is also derived from the ancient Fussac language, belonging to another variant, for Klein, who is a half historian, It's not difficult, it took a little time to get to the basics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell?" Rui Ni slightly asked in a strange way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned over his head and looked to the side, smiling and laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want Going to chase a treasure, I don’t know when I will come back.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I get a big sum of money, I buy a manor in the suburbs and plant some rubber trees. Get a vineyard, have your own mill, wine cellar, blacksmith shop, let the air fill a variety of spice flavors, then buy a few slaves, please some servants, just like those lords, huh, huh same. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He defeated the goose bumps that are about to emerge, turning to look at Rui Ni’s eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There is still a wife, but the mistress of the manor." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rinnie, I like you, I want to marry you, I said it today, not to get an answer, I am afraid I have no chance to tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rinnie listened quietly and suddenly angered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Winter, you are a coward! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah... This reaction is a bit wrong... Klein deliberately showed a surprised expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rinnie repressed the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three years ago, three years ago, I already Be prepared to go to Byam with you. As a result, you didn't say anything! You coward! You coward!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You tell me now, again What is the use? You are going to go out to sea soon, maybe you can't come back again! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more she talks, the more excited she is:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that you are happy, No regrets, but what should I do? Always thinking that you will come back, have been suffering? You are a selfish ghost! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waved her broom and slammed it to the opposite Winter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein knew that the real Winter would kill the broom, hug the girl, tell her that she would not go out to sea, but he couldn’t do it. He could only pretend to be embarrassed and ran all the way to the nearby alley. The head slammed the wall and silently said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too TM is ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rinnie returns to the door, holding a broom, Knocked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is gray and she doesn't know what to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the vagueness, she heard a voice, and then the whole person fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the spell of Klein turned out, pushed down the wall to sit on the ground of Rui Ni, and then quickly left here, hiding in the distance to peek ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rinnie quickly woke up and found that she didn’t know when she slept. Everything just seemed like a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is still sitting there for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she buried her head and made a whisper, thin, low-lying squeak that seemed to be squeezed out of the throat:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
