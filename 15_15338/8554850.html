			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler seems to be a little afraid of the other person’s embarrassment and unconsciously stepped back:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liv, this is a detective, he thinks, he wants to help you find something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Livdo has wrinkles and peeling marks turned to Klein Indifferently said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have already called the police."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She may only have more than 30 Years old, but the appearance looks close to fifty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked around the room with a lot of wet clothes, vaguely remembered when he came last time, there is a 13-year-old girl here, she is careful She wore a simple and rough homemade iron, and handled the wrinkled clothes after drying. Her hands were often burnt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the "missing" thing... Klein looks back at the pulping lady Liv, saying in an emotional-free tone:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you believe that the Eastern District Police will really look for Daisy?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must have caused something to be lost" Those people who don’t take their eyes to your home? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to lose another daughter after losing one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cruel but heartbreaking The words were introduced into the ear of the pulping lady Liv, the expression of her indifference on her face was a little disintegrated, her mouth was open, but nothing could be said, and her eyes gradually turned red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slammed her head and said in pain and desperation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't Money..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was quiet and quiet, and even the sobbing girl did not say anything again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein licked his mouth and sighed aloud:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I occasionally go Do volunteers, help others purely, huh, I haven't done it for a long time, please give me a chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Volunteer?" Li Fu raised his head and chewed With this word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This commission is free, no, not completely Free, good behavior will bring me great satisfaction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, you have no other way, why not try it?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liv silent for a moment, lifted the palm of his hand that wrinkled and swollen for a long time, wiped his eyes, and said: "<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Detective, you, you are a kind and kind gentleman..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice suddenly choked: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This is the case. At noon the day before yesterday, Frya led Daisy and sent a batch of washed clothes back, just outside the Eastern District. They have to go to several streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to get back to lunch, Frya chose a secluded alley, but she was just a one who didn't pay attention and found that the thing behind it was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She returned to the original search, never found, and Daisy has never returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Freia, where was it at the time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl named Freya has Standing up, his eyes were red and swollen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sobbed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just in the Axe Lane, Mr. Detective Will Daisy be fine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should." Klein replied with no expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there something that Daisy often carries? I can borrow a police dog. It has an excellent sense of smell and can find each other along the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...no." Li Fu, a woman who washed the pulp, thought about it and said sadly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girl Frya shed tears again and felt that things seemed to be in a desperate situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, she blinked her eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, there is one.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Western word book! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Word Book? "Old Kohler asked a question next to him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liffe sucked his nose:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I have a free school that lets Frya and Daisy go to the night, I can always wash the laundry, they, they can't always do this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wife is really a good mother... Klein couldn’t help but feel a word.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Free school is a night school established by three churches or some charitable organizations. It will be held from 8:00 to 10:00 pm. There is no charge at all, and even writing instruments and certain papers will be provided free of charge. It is an illiterate education. At the very least, some religious knowledge is involved. Old Neil once worked as a teacher for a few years at the free night goddess, and Klein heard him mention some things.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;——Because there are very few people who volunteer to be free school teachers, there is a unique teaching mode, that is, the teacher arrives in advance, first summons the students who have the best progress, and will talk about today. The content is instilled in them, and then they are responsible for the teaching of different classes, the teacher will patrol back and forth, correcting and correcting mistakes, which is called “guided system.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding to free schools, there are also free workshops for skilled workers, etc. Weaving, they are the few channels that the real poor can reach, and they can get rid of their own class.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there are too few similar organizations, and it’s hard to play. Substantial role.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Freya sobbed and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"黛Xi likes to study very much. She has been identified by the teacher as the guide of her class. She will put together the papers that have copied the words, hold them to sleep with them every day, and then get up early, go to the street outside. With the light of the morning, she has been very sorry. I regret that there are no street lights nearby..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashion rushed back to the bed, from the broken A stack of crumpled paper was taken under the pillow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the long-term wet environment, the words on the copy have been somewhat dizzy.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The edge of the paper is even more worn and seems to be turned over and over for a long time.<br /><br />&n Bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Detective, it, is it ok? "Freia will not have a so-called word book bound at all, handed it to Klein with both hands, and then asked with a sigh.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes. Klein replied very succinctly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not comforting Frya, although similar items are not carried around, but long-term goals are accompanied, And projecting the strong beliefs of the other party, is an excellent material for people to find people with the wand method.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned over the word book:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I started to act, the sooner I find it, the better." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liv and Freya can't find the extra words to describe their feelings, they can only watch Klein and the old Kohler leave, and continue to repeat Say "thank you", "Thank you, Mr. Detective", "Thank you, kind gentleman".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the apartment, Klein sideways Kohler Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have recently paid attention to those unemployed textile women workers, especially those who have not found a new job and have not become a street girl. I don't know where I went...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You pay attention to safety, ask less and listen more. If you do well, there will be bonuses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" Old Kohler focused on the first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not immediately say goodbye, hesitated, and asked in a full-looking tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Detective, you can definitely find something, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can only say that I can do my best." Klein did not guarantee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler sighed and smiled bitterly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I lost my child So, the last thing I want to see is this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his hand and headed for another street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not slow to leave here, on the way, using the "word book" of Daisy to wrap the cane's head, not unobtrusive In the case, I completed a "crowding person". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a result, the northwest direction... I can’t confirm whether it’s disturbed or misleading... He looked down at the direction in which the cane was going to fall, and reached out it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the revelation, Klein went out of the East and hired a rental carriage. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the carriage that was adjusted in the direction stopped at Ayers Street near the West End in the Jowood area, parked in a vast lawn, wide Garden, small fountain square and marble statue in front of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Klein’s cane has fallen down in the compartment, pointing straight to it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the window, Klein saw guards in the gates of the iron fence and a dog that spit out his tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alert there is quite strict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, even if he is not using divination, he can find out that there is no danger in it by his spiritual intuition! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is this? How can the disappearance of Daisy involve this dangerous place? Klein meditated for a few seconds and told the driver to move on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coachman responded with a slight surprise:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr., you are not coming to visit Kaping Mr.?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaping? Klein thinks the name is very familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you think so?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are people who come out from the Eastern District and take my carriage here. Oh, this is the home of Mr. Ka Ping, the richest man." The coach replied casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East District...Kaping...Rich?...Klein suddenly remembered who Kapin was:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; In many rumors, he is the leader of a bloody criminal group, and is associated with many disappearances of naive girls! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, he is the rich man who knows many big people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not say more, leaning back against the wall, half closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage slowly moved forward, and the luxury villa swept back and disappeared into the glass window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a small cubicle in a cafe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls already knows that the opposite old man is Lawrence Nord, from Constance City in the Middle of the Sea, is a public school teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know that Mrs. Anlisa’s husband had died, and she did not know that Mrs. Anlisa’s inheritance had become an extraordinary person, and she could not even think of Mrs. Anlisa. Will leave the relics to me... Will he be an extraordinary person? Does he have the ability to divination?
