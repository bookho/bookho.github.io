			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning hours, the sky is slightly bright, and the corners of the lane are mostly quiet and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Deniz’s cloak, Klein blends into the shadows and walks fast, feeling gray and black, the reality is blurry, all the sounds are As if coming from the depths of the stars, it is empty and far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the Avenue of Fragrant Trees to the maximum extent, he identified the position and “grows out” from the shadows, which emerges in an unmanned alley full of bricks and gravel. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shakes his hands and smashes the "steel" Maviti wrapped in the peacock blue "flying carpet" and throws it in front of him, in order to be in the other side The body can complete “grazing” before the body begins to dissipate! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lost the "flying carpet", stepped forward, extended his left palm, slightly pointed five fingers, and condescended to the body with the remaining temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The creepy hunger" is exposed to the original appearance, thin as if made of human skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its palm position splits two eyes, the pupil is bright red, like blood staining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden breeze chilling into the bone marrow in the alley, swirling on the body of the "steel" Maviti, twisting to form a nearly transparent The human figure can vaguely see thick lips and steel ball-like curls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McVati's expression is extremely painful, trying to resist the attraction of "squirming hunger", while the gray and black and green mixed light is like a surge. The moving Milky Way quickly flew out of the flesh and blood and blended into the transparent figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McViti makes a silent scream, trying to beg for mercy Inferior, can only be desperately drilled into the human leather gloves, fixed on the blank finger, and publicize the extraordinary characteristics, and have a certain relationship with the environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This association determines which abilities can be used when grazing the soul of "Steel" Maviti, perhaps one, maybe two, no more than three . The specific content is not controlled by Klein until it is fixed, purely random. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The creepy hunger" quickly covered the pale, and eventually changed back to the previous disguise: an ordinary black glove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed his eyes for a few seconds, and some relaxed and a little sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, his luck is not bad, but not too good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He succeeded in acquiring the three extraordinary abilities of "Steel" Maviti, but none of them wanted to be afraid of shooting, not afraid of fire, not afraid of a certain amount of bombs. "Body like steel" and tenacious vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the power of the "live corpse", which allows me to make a violent attack, to make up for the style defects of the previous agile fighting, and the second is the "ice" Master, although not like the witch route, condense the ice gun, create a blizzard, do the most direct attack, but can freeze the surrounding ground, reduce the air temperature, effectively affect the opponent's actions, if there is physical contact, even frozen the enemy , stiff his flesh and blood, perfect match with fighting ability, the third is "manipulating the living corpse", huh, huh, I am not afraid that people will not be able to afford the game in the future... Klein thinks a little, bending over to check "steel" Maiwei Carrying items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly found out 26 pounds 11 Sule 8 pence cash, and a bunch of seemingly normal strange things, such as candles, clips, thorns Whip, wait, etc. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that the "steel" Maviti probability is a member of the "Rose School" and belongs to the series of indulgence desires, Klein vaguely understands what, 呸With a cry, I put away the cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Wolfman' has super-self-healing power, 'live corpse' has a steel-like body, does not need to bring therapeutic drugs or items... and In the judgment of Daniz, there is no magical thing in Maviti... Also, the number of magical items is scarce, and many have obvious defects and negative effects. Not everyone wants to have it, anyone can have it, before the 'resentment', 'Live corpse', 'Wolfman' combination, only two magical items, 'Crimson Moonlight' and 'Biotoxin Bottle'..." Kline nodded and took a stack of paper from his pocket. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a reward order with the portrait of Maviti and the corresponding reward amount:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"6000 pounds!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stood up straight, stepped back, stepped on the peacock blue "flying carpet" and pulled out a paper man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a small arm, his wrists are shaking, throwing paper people out, turning into fire particles, flying and falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he became a shadow again, disappearing into the alley with the item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two or three minutes, Cordova Royer rushed with some of the "deceased" players, just to see a cool breeze will be rewarded Let the wind blow up, revealing the "steel" Maviti flesh and blood dissolves, the eyes round face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦, the reward is dropped next to it, still facing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Córdoba and others who lost their tracks with "steel The body of the body, silently returned to the area where the battle took place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team members who looked at the scene, as the deacon's Córdoba convergence, asked: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'Sun' believers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most important issue for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsible for finding clues, using supernatural means to restore the truth, is not the extraordinary person of the "storm" approach, but the "reader" Sequence 7 "Shouzhi", also known as "Detective", he did not rush to answer, came over and squatted to check the body of Maviti. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he looked up and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a 'solar' believer, with It should be the power of magical items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reason?" Cordova asked with a frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "deceased" player said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a deep flesh The sense of evil, one of the bodies is swallowed like this, leaving only its own speciality and objects. If it is a 'solar' believer, even if it depends on the goods, it will not do similar things. For them, Everything in the 'real creator' field is filthy and must be purified or sealed immediately, and should not be borrowed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Córdoba thought for a few seconds I agree with this judgment and instead ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aurora's people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the real 'Royal Bishop' or 'Shepherd' will not be so rough, they will definitely wrap the body in their own body, wait until they leave, and then do the treatment. There is no reason to dismember on the spot, which is a waste of time and leaves a The heap is still worthwhile. It’s like the negative effect of magical items, so eager to swallow.” The “scepter” calmly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are magical items in the field of 'Sun' and 'Secret"? Or the kind of 'Shepherd' ability? Berg, your judgment Which is it?” As a deacon, Córdoba has the right to know the “shepherd” and their special abilities, and the “scepter” knows that it is based on his position in the ranks, and the rest of the “offenders” I don't understand what they are saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Secretifier" Berg stood up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All are possible."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a suspect?" Cordova asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beg shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no target for the time being.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A terrible strongman..." Córdoba whispered in a dignified expression, and immediately his eyes lit up. "Will it be Edwina? She can simulate some extraordinary abilities she has seen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Secretary" Berger indulged in the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not rule out this possibility, but intelligence It shows that she was still near the island of Sunia a few days ago, unless she could simulate the corresponding ability and shuttle through the spiritual world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dowa took a few steps back and forth and looked around for a circle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Handling the scene, don't alarm nearby residents.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will submit the mission report, hoping to get more and more effective intelligence. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This involves a strongman who is at least equal to the sequence 5, so that he can only restrain the violent mood and make the most sensible decision.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Quinn’s house, in the basement of the heavy stone gate blockade.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the low bed, quietly looking at the candle on the table, Alger suddenly saw a flower, saw the diffuse fog, and the high back chair in the fog The "fool" overlooking everything.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blurred figure is placed underneath, hands clasped, against the front of the face, in a pious tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great 'fool', the matter has come to an end. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a smooth end? It is "steel" Maviti and several extraordinary people... "The world" is really neat, the strength is more than I imagined. To be strong, it is worthy of the "fool" Mr.... Hehe, he can sell extraordinary characteristics at the Tarot meeting, maybe more than one... How did he bypass the seal "2-37"? The speciality of the oracles? Alger's thoughts flashed, and the instinct thanked Mr. "The Fool".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he pulled out a metal vial and minted it inside. Pure dew is applied to the nose.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong irritating scent into the head, Alger instantly becomes very awake.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t know when he had a white gauze mask and poured the “Moon Essential Oil” up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary wearing a mask, Alger stood up and slowly walked over to the heavy stone door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a calm and steady out of the inside of the clothes. The sealed metal can, twisted the mechanical switch, and pulled out a pipe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he stuffed the pipe into the crack of the stone door and extended it. Go out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent, the gas in the metal can quickly spread out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is "Moon" Emlin's blood anesthesia gas!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can make strong ordinary people, sequence 9 with the body's extraordinary, higher sequence but physical Not good enough to stun the past!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the old Quinn can hold on, it will be obviously affected, as for his helpers and friends, huh... With Shimen, wait patiently.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gas in the tank diverged nearly one-third, he took the tube back and closed the switch.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his body and listened to the outside movement, and he got a satisfactory answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger showed a smile, breath Fast Convergence, doing backlog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his body muscles all swelled and he made a punch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Furious blow"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
