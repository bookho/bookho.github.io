			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room filled with the "Amanda" pure dew and the "Eye of the Eyes" potion, Klein's underarms are controlled by Klein. Constantly mourning the name of the "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a monotonous but rhythmic whisper, in the scent that is difficult to concentrate, the man’s spiritual body gradually diverges, and the whole person becomes awkward but Maintaining a certain level of peculiar waking is like self-hypnosis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He entered the "artificial" with the feedback of the "folly" name in the spiritual form of Klein "help" In the state of sleepwalking, the spirit of the star is close to the fog of infinity, close to the mystery above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein seized the opportunity, ended the call, returned to the ancient palace, and sat in the position of the "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a clear ray of light around his body, which outlined the illusory figure of Kapyeong’s man, and this mysterious space was influenced by the ceremony. There was a slight shock, and some forces were shaken and slowly flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein picked up the "Black Emperor" card and let a paper man flash in his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his wrist, and the paper man flew out, absorbing the biting power that was swayed above the fog, turning it into a gray-black cap. The man in a thick cotton coat is the same as the one in Kapin's hand. There is no difference between breath and feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper man overlaps with the target illusion, replacing him with the mysterious and unknown limitations of the spirit. At the same time, Klein held the "Black Emperor" card, spread out the spirituality, and touched the illusion of Kapyeong under the clear light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an application of the metaphysical element. The weak human being fits in with the great existence, feels the corresponding knowledge, and gains a wonderful spiritual experience. The normal difference is that here Klein plays the role of great existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this state of close fit, the interaction is corresponding, human beings can acquire the knowledge of great existence, and the great existence can naturally be read by questioning. Out of the desired scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Kline’s inability to master the extraordinary powers of the mind, he could use it to make hints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the powerful characters in the Kaping villa?" Klein asked through the interactive spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom didn’t have any resistance to pass the picture in memory, so Klein was like watching a holographic movie:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man wearing a cap is standing in the room with fear and respect. In front of him is a middle-aged gentleman wearing a black tuxedo and a white hair band. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gentleman has a long and serious face, his mouth naturally squatting, giving a feeling of extreme indifference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed the gold bracelet, pulled out the same color pocket watch, and glanced at it, then screamed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man wearing a cap does not dare to raise his head in disbelief and looks forward:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Mr. Heras."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s not seen, he saw a pair of eyes shining with strange light I heard the command-like words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Secret!!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't be in this villa Everything I saw inside was leaked to someone outside. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man wearing a cap trembles inexplicably, only to feel that he must follow the instructions of the other party.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He lowered his head again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Mr. Heras. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in the cap is holding a comatose girl along the stairs. Come to the entrance to the underground area.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, there is a small room that is separated from the room where you can't see the specific age of Hu Dahan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hustle and bustle Hu Dahan has a pair of cold blue eyes, with a fine flannel in his hand, carefully rubbing the gray-white complex rifle on the table. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rifle was thick and long, connected to a huge, same-color mechanical box through a pipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a high pressure steam rifle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a military tube product! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Bellis..." The man wearing the cap has prepared to bow down and say hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man wearing the cap entered the neat layout, like the prison’s underground building. The comatose girl was locked into one of the small rooms and reluctantly touched the sensitive part of the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He locked the door of the house, returned to the hallway, and raised the lantern assigned to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he saw a walk in the deep side of the corridor at the other end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of the figure seems to be able to see through the darkness without carrying any lighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man wearing a cap uses the light of a lantern to find out that it is a woman of about 30 years old. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman wore a brown bonnet in the middle, wearing a thin white shirt and bib trousers, a pair of leather boots on the knees and knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has several old scars on her face, and her mouth is always holding a cruel smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man wearing the cap is stunned and stunned, screaming out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ms. Katie..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman ignored him, step by step, step by step, as if he was just an air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lady called Katie went away, the man wearing the cap snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"婊子! Going to bed is definitely more than a prostitute!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He topped the top, put on the lantern, and left the underground area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man wearing the cap met two in the magnificent hall, the golden light hall Men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the heights is one meter sixty-five, the figure is a bit blessed, the appearance has no special features, but the eyes are always scary, another one in the first seventies It looks quite old-fashioned and has a slight head-up pattern. His nose is tall and tall, and he has a brown skin and a god. It looks like no deterrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Kaping..." The man wearing the cap first said hello to the middle-aged man who was somewhat blessed, then to another person, "Mr. Parker... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning light shimmering, the man wearing a cap is at the entrance to the underground area At the scene, I met the indifferent middle-aged gentleman known as Mr. Heras. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heraz wearing a white hair wig, aiming at him with respect and standing next to him, unconsciously extending his right palm, aiming at the entrance to the underground area, majestic And the low opening:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Confinement!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uninterrupted, feeling around There are subtle differences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of four extraordinary people, at least four...the strongest should be That Mr. Heras, the least sequence 6, or even the sequence 5... I don't know what the way is, and it is similar to the "Black Emperor" road... relying on order, issuing a law? According to the previous scene, it can be preliminarily judged that the ban is only for the underground area, and does not include the whole villa. It is also the day when people come and go. Once banned, it is too much trouble to get in and out... I don’t know if it is the same at night... Klein analysis With the information I just received, I asked again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What is the overall structure of the villa?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly received feedback and saw the splendid hall, the elegant and spacious restaurant, the corridor across the first floor, and Toilets, underground areas and other scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With them, Klein put together the general layout of the Kaping villa in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the consumption of spirituality, he asked the last question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kaping and Which big people are closely related?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene presented in front of him is the magnificent hall, a half-naked girl or squatting to give wine to the guests. Drinks, or let them fight to play, or directly to a secluded place, to be devastated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not old, their expressions are painful and numb, a little slow, or not enthusiastic, and the waiters or maids of Kapin will beat them with a whip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people witnessed the scene of sin, but did not have a bit of sympathy, rushing to express themselves and trying to be appreciated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw Kapyeong in those guests, saw Mr. Heras, who was indifferent, and saw a member of the House of Commons Vadandra who often went to the newspaper. I saw an obese man called the deputy director...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is Baekeland A deputy director of the German Police Department? This is the top of the police department... Those people are not even a good one... Also, the villa must have been screened and trusted... Klein smashed his forehead and stopped the state of close coordination. - The man wearing a cap is just a small leader, and there are at most things that can be known or involved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And until this time, the mysterious unknown limit has still not been touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein ended the ceremony, letting the other person's figure disappear above the fog, and he immediately returned to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ethereal and illusory room, he sat down on the edge of the bed and looked at the man in a cap that was comatose on the ground. Based on the information he had just obtained, he analyzed the feasibility of the performance. Thinking about one plan after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Klein had a definite idea and said to himself silently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe not Need helper...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The helper will drag me down, making it inconvenient for me to escape in danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s very important to pick the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly fifty minutes later, the man wearing a black-and-grey cap appeared in the Eastern District and headed straight to the streets controlled by the Zmanger Party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just saw a few people with dark skin, thin and delicate, full of fierce people, he immediately moved closer, pretending not to look at the road, hit one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! You guys help!" The capman screamed loudly and punched at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few plateau people who liked to fight had become a group with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, the cap man pulled out his dagger, and the plateau people also showed their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗呲! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the battle, a dagger could not escape the neck of the man in the cap, just hit the artery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cap man fell down and the bright red blood was moored around his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly lost his life, and an illusory and transparent figure disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein returned to the fog and used it as a springboard to re-enter his body and opened his eyes in a cheap hotel in the Jowood area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
