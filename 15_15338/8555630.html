			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West End, Edward Street, No. 6. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icone Bernard pressed the black top hat and pointed to the door of the house behind the fountain pool, to Klein, Essinger and Caslana道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have reversed the various channels of news and data disclosure, combined with the profile of the side face, as well as the additional help of the mirror, preliminary Locked up a suspect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the mirror, you obviously paused, and don’t know what price to exchange for the answer you want... ... Klein perceives the problem of Icons, and inexplicably sympathizes with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the owner of this house?" Kaslana almost certainly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essinger. Stanton is looking around, as if thinking:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The choice to inform us directly is because you have found another evidence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the portrait of the owner of the house can prove something, oh, he Never take pictures," Icons replied frankly. "In addition, the surrounding residents have seen a big black dog nearby, many times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This basically proves that the goal is the 'desire apostle'." When it comes to this, Essinger suddenly laughs. "Sorry, we are too anxious, so that you have no chance to introduce the suspect."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons edged around the fountain pool and headed for the main entrance of the house, saying very quickly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The owner of this house is called Patrick Jason, a major shareholder of a small bank, according to his neighbors, is a cheerful, enthusiastic, optimistic middle-aged man who has been Married, but there should be mistresses, several.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In his class, the number of servants he employs is seriously insufficient. Every time a dinner or dance is held, extras are needed. From the 'Metropolitan Helping Family Servant Association', please ask a group of temporary waiters. His explanation is that his sleep is problematic and too many servants will destroy the quiet he needs. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be seen that he has many secrets to hide, so he does not dare to hire too many servants. Essinger said half-jokingly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who was not hired by a servant, said a little bit: <br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe just because his financial situation is not as good as everyone thinks. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this is a factor that cannot be ruled out." Essinger stepped onto the steps and came to the front door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons looked at Klein and seemed to say something:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't hire a servant, just let the landlord's maid do two temporary cleanings a week, just to cover up the secret of being an extraordinary person?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all my secrets, this is the smallest one... Klein deliberately smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the conversation, Icons reached out and pushed the main door open, and an indescribable stench floated from the inside.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The smell of decay..." Essinger made a quick judgment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons shouted a "Mechanical Heart" squad Players:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Carlson, what did you find? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary person named Carlson wore a pair of glasses with thick lenses and a complex face:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We found a lot of bodies here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the basement of the concrete, in the thick walls, the garden weeds, there are hidden bodies, the earliest may be traced back to More than a decade ago, the latest was the servants who were alive a few days ago.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he spoke, members of the "Mechanical Heart" and carefully selected police officers carried out one body after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bodies are completely dismembered, tongues, fingers, stomach pockets, eyes, etc. are cluttered together, while others are just a bunch of white bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that many of Bakerland’s disappearances will be broken." Essinger squeezed his nose and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw a little intestine dragged to the ground, spit out, and turned to look at the situation around the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carson Heart" member Carlson whispered two more words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Jason gave the servants a high salary and a lot of holidays. The servants around the guests were very envious... Jason’s chef also promised his children, who would go home once this week and take him to the circus. Performance..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a demon..." Kaslana moved slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking around, Klein converges on emotions and solemnly asks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is it so simple?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As a banker, even if the bank is small, Jason should also have valuable porcelain, excellent oil painting, luxury wall. Clock, all kinds of items made of good silk, why can't you see these on the spot? Well, the wood used for his furniture is still very good. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlson looked at ICONSER's deacon and said that he had agreed to the dagger: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It is obvious that Jason has planned for a long time for this revenge, and has sold items that are worthless in the room, and even agreed to the acquisition of his own industry by the Bavarian Bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After killing the servant, he speeded up the cash withdrawal, sold oil paintings and other things, it seems very clear that he will definitely be found, no hug Fortunately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the action, he only had houses, furniture and an identity here. A lot of cash, precious metals and jewellery didn't know him. Where did it move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Carlson’s description, Klein’s mind came out with several adjectives:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm, reason, crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A true demon." Essinger commented, and immediately said, "He is very clear-headed, he is calm, but has a strong madness." Tendency and adventurous spirit, which is consistent with the characteristics of the previous two actions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, we have to beware of his adventures?" Klein keenly grasped Stan The focus of the Detective Discourse in Dunda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Essinger focused on the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, several detectives searched inside the house and found a lot of evidence to prove that Patrick Jason had problems, and saw that the pair was hanging Portraits in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is a middle-aged man with tall cheekbones, blue eyes with gray, ordinary facial features, and hair combed neatly, without any special features. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Icahn came in and said to Klein and others:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We I found some items in a secret room and confirmed that Patrick Jason had tried to summon a more powerful demon, but I didn’t know why it didn’t succeed, and those items confirmed his identity. He was a member of the demon family of Beria. His real name should be Jason Beria."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belia family? Klein nodded unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the ancient Quaternary, the human forces that worshiped the devil formed a loose alliance called "Blood-seeking", which is very serious within the organization. The three devil families of North, Andrérad, and Beria are all standing up. Their ancestors have received gifts from the abyss. They worship a god of the darkness called 'the dark side of the universe' and think that he is the master of the abyss. It is bound to erode and corrupt the entire world's vast universe of annihilators." Essinger introduced a few words to the wild extraordinary Klein and Kaslana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
