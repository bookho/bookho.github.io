			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean seriously thought for a while and made all kinds of speculations in his heart, but because of the lack of sufficient conditions, he could only temporarily attribute the cause of the matter to the earth and the world. The time flow rate is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I and Russell have been separated by less than a year, and have been stretched here for nearly two hundred years, that is, even if I spend two hundred years I found the way to go back, and I wouldn’t miss their father and mother. At most, they have been missing for a year...” Klein made an inference in the reverse direction. He felt a lot better, and he was a little smug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he himself knows that this reasoning is not rigorous because there is only one initial condition and it is currently undetermined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if Russell crossed after me? That may involve the so-called turbulence of time and space. At that time, there is no way to guarantee that it will return to the right node... Klein poured cold water on his sudden expansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell’s first diary was a long-awaited product that took up more than two pages. Klein turned to the end and read the rest. Two of them: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "February 25, it’s a boring world, even the newspapers are not, the novels are pitiful! I think, I It is necessary to do a cultural poverty alleviation, but the premise of this matter is that if you have to get a sum of money, you have to recall the improved papermaking and printing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "As a traverser, I can only rely on the pocket money of the cheap old lady to maintain my life. The bright Fairkin can only see one or two occasionally. This is a sad story." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, hunting is quite interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"February 28, This world may be a bit different from what I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I lost my way in the woods because of hunting today, and I watched a super The battle of elephants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Among them, the man who was surrounded, had extra eyes on his face, a whole four! And fired from inside The dark green light! This, this TM is not scientific! Is this a humanoid monster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is actually a fantasy world?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The monster's opponent is even more powerful, summoning a beam of light burning with a golden flame, um, it should be summoned..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, they didn't find me. After solving the monster, they left their bodies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Huang Tao, really is the protagonist, just discovered the truth of the world in just a few days!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe they can recognize the mysterious symbols and patterns on the silver medal What do you represent... Of course, I won't ask, I want to be someone like them, crack it myself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason Say, there is another major reason, I can't remember the ghost-like pattern and look like it, only vaguely think about it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough is the protagonist? Great, are you pouring your own soul of the second to the diary? Klein couldn't help but spit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very interested in the silver medal that is suspected of Russell’s reason, and is very interested in figuring out what the symbols and patterns look like.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can really rely on the occultal knowledge of the world to interpret, then crossing may not be a coincidence... Klein put down his diary and slammed his desk down and lifted the "downside man" And the "magician" they enjoy the shielding measures.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You trade on your own. Klein leaned back on the back of the chair and said with a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Fols quietly took a breath:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to buy the stomach of the spiriter and the blood of 20 ml of deep sea squid, paid in gold pounds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still have £430, I can afford one... She silently encouraged herself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; As for the rest of the money from where she came, she will have no way for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the main reasons that restrict the promotion of many extraordinary people... People, really can't try to consume more than their own ability, if not to completely get rid of the influence of the full moon slang, become a master of tricks, have a relatively rich and extraordinary means After that, I will not consider the issue of promotion any more. I will not even touch the circle, write books, save money, drink tea, go shopping with Hugh, and wait for her to finish the matter, then go to the northern continent. Traveling in different places on the mainland, not afraid of dangers and accidents, enjoying life... Foss’s thoughts suddenly diverged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when she thought that no one would respond, Alger said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" I saw the blood of the deep sea squid at the meeting of the big pirates, but unfortunately, you have already missed it, you should say it earlier, no, I said wrong, then you still Didn't join the Tarot Club."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean by this? Show off your qualifications? Foers secretly whispered, and asked in a serious way: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Inverted man', you can pay more attention to me, the price is 300 to 400 pounds Acceptable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sea is wider than the land, Pirates may not be able to meet once in half a year, even in the capitals of the archipelago they sell, there will be no extraordinary material gathering.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Baekeland The metropolises of Germany, Trier, St. Milon, and Fenneport City can gather a lot of materials. Listen to your accent, you should be a Becklander, or have been settled in Beckland for many years." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean by yourself? Fols almost looked up at the towering dome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "Sun" Dairik opened:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know a few foods The scope of the spirit's approximate activities.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don't need the gold pound you said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... "Magic" Firth smirked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Sun God Official" potion formula... "Justice" Audrey is the first to answer in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derrick seriously thought:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The formula of 'Sun God Official' potion "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the recipe for Sequence 7? I have heard of it, but the formula for this sequence is at least 750 pounds, if you are in a hurry People can even sell for more than a thousand pounds, and the blood of the appetizer's stomach bag and deep sea squid is less than 400 pounds per piece. Most of the time it is worth only 300 pounds. Do you understand what I mean?" Fols tried to make the "sun" clear that this is not an equivalent transaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric replied without hesitation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can give you two to three The stomach bag of a spirited person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the extra deep sea squid, he did not consider it at all. He has never seen it in the sea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More foodie stomach bags... What can I do? Baked, or fried? If you sell it, I don’t know when it’s time to sell it... The main thing is, I can’t afford the formula of “Sun God Official” now... Fuls squeezes out the smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will try to collect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered the "Eternal Vigor" believer who wears a mask at Mr. A’s party and is good at purifying. I remembered the "Ling of Light" ring and thought that I could get a clue to the "Sun God Official" potion recipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the money is not enough... "Magic" Foer thought for a moment, touched his face, looked around, and asked sincerely: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, do you have any good way to make money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice just fell, just I found that everyone was in silence at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence is a silent palace, a quiet fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that everyone is bothered by this problem, and Mr. "fool" does not need money... Fols wisely closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good way to make money is not to have ranch, mine, field, factory, stock, etc... Well, you can also go to the kingdom’s reward order, follow The price and the standards that it can withstand, in order to complete... Audrey knows that he has no real money-making experience, and can only respond to a few words in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bicycle project to understand... Kline resisted the urge to manipulate the "world" opening, which would expose his real identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, he kept an inscrutable gesture and made the "world" gloomy and hoarse:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Help me to pay attention to the pituitary and blood of the thousands of hunters, as well as the characteristics of the shadows of the human skin, the hair of the deep sea Naga."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Although Klein has only 589 pounds left, he has more of the Werewolf's extraordinary characteristics and biotoxin bottles, and considers the opportunity to make the former a magical item and then sell one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the cost of a sequence of 6 extraordinary materials is more than enough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he intends to let the Tarot members pay attention in advance so as not to miss it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." "Sun" Dairik took the lead to answer, but did not make a promise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to the spirits, the human shadow and the thousands of hunters are not so easy to encounter monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thousand-faced hunters? I seem to have seen its fossils." "Justice" Audrey replied with a reply, "Hey, I will go back and confirm." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fossil is in the treasure house of the Duke of Nigan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is already fossil, perhaps extraordinary features have long been taken away... Klein manipulated the "world" and nodded nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quiet for a while, "downside down" Alger Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You help me Pay attention to a person, related to the disappearance of the colonial slaves mentioned earlier.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He claims to be a balun, with a brownish-brown color and obvious characteristics of the southern continent, but Someone accidentally heard that he spoke in an accent with a Beckland tone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third tooth on his left is missing, but it is likely to have been added.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the appearance has no characteristics, and the height is quite ordinary.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can find his trace, the reward is not a problem , at least 100 pounds, or equivalent items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a description, even divination can't be done, let alone find someone..." "Klein looks around in a circle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Free communication."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knot After Tarot party, "sun" wearing Rick returned to the real world, re-exposure in the dark narrow room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat cautiously for a few seconds, did not find any abnormal changes, and finally completely relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the "downside down" Mr. asked himself to talk to the former team leader, Dairik came to the corresponding metal wall and bent his fingers. Knocked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;笃,笃<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He completed the secret number, but the opposite side has not responded for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asleep? Or was it taken to the six-member council? Dairik looked at the dull metal wall and thought with doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, behind his bed, suddenly there was an old and whispering voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
