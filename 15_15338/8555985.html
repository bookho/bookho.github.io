			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a violent bombing, the martyrdom entering the main burial chamber was displayed in the eyes of the members of the "Mechanical Heart". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground is full of slag, another diamond-like characteristic that reflects the face is quietly lying at the bottom of the right wall, with the other two glowing The items complement each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a pothole in the entire ramp, including the walls on both sides and the top slab, but one thing was intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a picture frame hanging seven or eight meters ahead, with a brownish-yellow color and a noticeable texture of wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to be reminded by others, all the extraordinary people present have seen its weirdness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the steam and mechanical church archbishop Horamick Haydn, who had never had a big move, stepped forward and said softly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be the 'ghost frame' belonging to the Amon family in the data record. As long as it enters its scope and is reflected in it, the spirit will instantly break away from the flesh and blood and become a A portrait is permanently sealed in it. In this state, even if the portrait is replaced, there is no corresponding way to get it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If sealed The time is too long, the body has died, and even if the correct method of releasing the seal is mastered, the spirit will quickly dissipate. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When talking, Holamik walked step by step, close to the strange frame.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Klein was somewhat worried and did not dare to look at the specific process of the demigod and the semi-human against the seal, but he quickly realized that he was only looking at the holographic image provided by the magic mirror Arrodes. What is good? Fearful?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s normal and normal, it’s the same as watching real-life feelings of horror movies and playing dark games... Klein self-explanatory and speeding up , keep up with Horamick Haydn.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop of the demigod soon came to the magical item that needs to be sealed, wearing white The priest's robes, the cloak of the clergyman's hood, reflected a little bit of glass on the surface of the frame.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glass...The Quaternary has glass? It seems to be In this way, at least there is glass in the history of the Fifth Age, and it is not mentioned who invented it... Klein waited half-heartedly with interest. The "fight" between man and strange seal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horamik's upper body is completely presented in the "ghost frame", but his eyes are not Lost in love!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the frame face to face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure in the frame fluctuated It seems to have been shrinking inward, but it can't be successful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horamik stopped and took out the long-prepared, almost opaque The black cloth covers the "ghost frame".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture frame flutters several times, and is finally completely obscured by the black cloth, which is calm.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horamik seems to have not been affected, easily remove the "ghost frame", complete the package with black cloth, and make a knot in the back.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...this is not occult... Doesn’t it mean that the spirit will be sucked into the frame and become a portrait? How the Archbishop has nothing at all... This is a half god Human special, or There is a reason? Klein wondered for a while, and looked up and down from Hola Mick Haydn. Nothing was found to be abnormal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a god in the eyes, a loving expression, flesh and blood... ... unfortunately, not at the scene, otherwise you can open a study to see... Klein regained his gaze and waited for the "Mechanical Heart" members of Icons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holamic gave the "ghost frame" to a team member and went forward to the entrance to the main tomb at the end of the ramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a black stone door with a knife-cut axe pattern, with a gray-white disc in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of the disc is divided into twelve compartments, with a black pointer, like an outside clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, those grids do not evenly distribute the discs, they are large and small, extremely uncoordinated, and each grid has half of it smeared with shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The coat of arms of the Amon family." Archbishop Horamick introduced a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not specifically explain the symbolic meaning of the coat of arms, because only the deacon-level ICONSER Bernard is qualified to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein relies on his own mystery accumulation to try to interpret:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The combination of the disk, the twelve grids and the hands clearly represents the time. It coincides with the fact that Amon’s demise and death leave the 'bugs of the time', which should be equally divided into twelve sizes of discs, covering a certain shadow. Does it mean that the Amon family is the dark side of time? Where are the names of their '渎神者'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's thoughts turn, Hora Archbishop Mick did not push the stone door open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone gate is heavy and open, revealing a very spacious tomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a high platform in the center of the tomb, with a dark black plaque on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are iron-colored lamp stands on the walls around them, holding a white candle that is still burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the candlelights are not swaying, quietly as if they are just frozen pictures, and have never experienced the traces of a thousand or two years of light wash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the straight road to Shimen, there is a corpse, they wear black coats, half-high silk hats, or ordinary The workers are dressed up and equipped with a top hat. It is a person who has only entered here in recent years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary people who recruited helpers before? How do they pass the front area? The monsters such as the shadows of the human skin are obviously still alive... Klein looked at the bodies with his head full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This look, he was a little scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bodies are all sparsely white, wrinkled, and marked, like the old man of eighty or ninety years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no obvious wounds on their bodies. It seems to be alive and dead, and it is not long before they die, but they will still rot in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, there will be no extraordinary people who have been so many years to explore the mausoleum, even if the people here are already old, they will try to pick young and strong when recruiting helpers. ... there is weird here! Klein frowned and looked around again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly associates with the "bugs of time" left by Amon, and associates with the Amon family coat of arms with time meaning on Shimen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s one of the extraordinary abilities of the Amon family to make people go quickly? The dark side of time... The loopholes of time... Is it possible for members of the Amon family to regain their youth and gain a longer life while letting others fly faster? Wait, these extraordinary people can easily get here, maybe the tomb owner intends to indulge, he wants to rob others of time to maintain their existence... Klein has speculated to look at the black shackles on the high platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Hola Mick Haydn, the demigod of the demigod, lifted his left hand and went to the next pressure:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Lord Archbishop." Icons and others replied without hesitation. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the official organization, they have read a large number of extraordinary event files, knowing that in similar circumstances, they must absolutely obey the will of the high sequencer, absolutely not good at Make a claim and act reluctantly, otherwise you will not know how it will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horamik looked forward and his eyes stopped at a frame that was buckled at the bottom of the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expression has not changed, and he walked forward unhurasably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little preparation is not done? The semi-god and half-human is characterized by "莽"? Klein looked quite wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have been able to imagine the loss of Horamick's teeth, white hair withered, dry skin wrinkles, and quickly look old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One step, two steps, three steps, the original normal Horamick suddenly shakes, the body has a bitter rubbing noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
