			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a few steps back and forth in the small shooting range, thinking about the intention of the Dark Goddess Church on the "Divination" sequence:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They don't want the nights to choose this route, or they don't want them to be strong on this path, so they only issue a sequence of auxiliary 9' divination. '? The captain also said that the church may have follow-up recipes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I can see the confidential information, they did not even provide the corresponding sequence The names of the potions of 8 and 7 only describe the corresponding combat characteristics... In other words, they do not want the following people to know that the top has the corresponding information..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it possible that all the nights who choose this route may become the "vengeful spirits" of the Antigonus family? So the church officials made similar decisions, or is there another reason? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the moment, Klein on the goddess of the night The high-level meeting of the meeting is full of doubts, has a strong alert and beware, reconsider whether to make a special application, and become a "clown":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this There are hidden terrible secrets inside, then I am not jumping into the crater myself? I am not the kind of person who can accept the rigorous investigation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "However, the Tingen branch has submitted a 'clown' formula. As a member of the 'divination family', knowing this, hope to get promoted, isn't it normal? And sequence 8 is still a low sequence, it should not It is too exaggerated attention..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only problem is that I completely "mastered" the potion in just one month and submitted a special application. If the top knows and understands the 'playing the law', it will understand the key at a glance... Of course, my reasons are sufficient. After all, I know the 'Psychic' Dai Li, and the sneak peek of the Neil. Be a friend, get inspired from it and complete it further Playing the law' is not too difficult to understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, even Dai Li is in the sequence of 7 'Psychic'. In the past three years, there have been signs of digestion, and I really entered the high-level line of sight. I was trained as the future archbishop and senior deacon... I will not attract too much attention at this stage of the 'clown' unless it is digested in a few months. Finish the potions and make sure they really have mastered the 'playing method'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, applying for the 'clown' potion is not too risky Behavior, you can continue, but you should pay attention to it later, hey, you can only take one step and take a step to go home and make a divination decision. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein converges on his thoughts and takes out the revolver in the gun bag and performs daily shooting exercises and maintenance.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of the pistol from classmate Welch is beyond his imagination, and it can last for a long time without accident. Of course, this is also due to his from Dunn and Renner. Germany learned about the maintenance of firearms.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, there is nothing wrong with it. This is all the materials that can be applied for. Klein glanced at the target, took the revolver, and left the "shooting club."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the Narcissus Street on the trackless public carriage, not yet close I saw a girl at the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This girl is wearing a blue dress with beautiful lace and a hat with a fine gauze hanging down. It was Melissa’s classmate, Elizabeth, who had a cute baby fat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Founding that Klein was close, she hurried up, took off her hat, and looked Happy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused for two seconds and smiled openly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon, Mo Mr. Retty. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think you must have just returned from the town of Ramde, right? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry, I am coming back in the morning... Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, I am coming back from Zouteland Street. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this is a very real answer... he thought with a funny smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Elizabeth stunned and said with a little excitement and excitement: "Okay, I guessed wrong. I am here to look for you, waiting here, I want to tell you, I didn't have another nightmare last night, no. Dream of the knight wearing black full armor! This is exactly the same as your divination! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the grievance was completely purified by the seal "3 - 0782", even I couldn't do it on the spot, not to mention your dreams... Klein chuckled and responded gently:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am glad that you got rid of the troubles and are very satisfied with my divination yesterday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Thank you again! Ok, I have to leave, I have to go to class in the afternoon, bye, Mr. Moretti, I will find time to visit Melissa~" Elizabeth walked briskly and got a taxi nearby. carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the slow sweeping of the wagon car window, her mouth twitched a little, proudly thinking: "Melissa certainly does not know she has a Such a powerful brother..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that my explanation has not been at all The role... The girl is always willing to believe her instincts and the facts that her brain made up... Kline watched Elizabeth get on the bus, shaking her head and pulling out the key to open the door and returning to her bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a break and began to sort out and summarize the previous week’s events, including those that were not resolved in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing this day, he burned the paper, took out the silver pocket watch, and glanced openly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two and a half? Wait another fifteen minutes..." Klein saw that there was still time to wear the oldest dress jacket and go to the iron cross. On the street, "Sling Bakery", I found Mrs. Wendy to buy a sweet iced tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drinking a drink and returning leisurely, he sealed the bedroom with spirituality at 2:45 and reversed four steps into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the still old ancient palace, Klein wrote a new divination statement on the existing parchment:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'clown' potion should be obtained through the night-time organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the pen, he untangles the wrap around the wrist Swing, hold it firmly with your left hand, and let the citrine pendant hang in the position that is about to touch the parchment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seven years of silent reading, his eyes turned deep, and the pendulum in his hand began to rotate slightly, turning clockwise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is yes, it should be...but the sequence after the "clown" is hard to say, still have to seriously develop my Tarot...Klein Aberdeen Carefully detail the matter again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he pressed his hand to the dark red star that represented the "sun." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to call the teenager in the Silver City in advance to confirm whether he has leaked the fog above the "six-member council", if not, Then give the other party a better way to master the meeting time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of Silver, in the Berg's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick sat quietly and silently at the bed, waiting for the call of the "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to fulfill matters that he would not stay with other people as much as possible, he simply did not go out after returning, and the food in the room was already eaten by him. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be patient with hunger, listening to the screaming screams, Dairik feels like a living corpse on the dark wasteland, but he still has no openings Did not get up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he saw a deep redness in the void, and swallowed himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray, innocent, deserted, silent world is again in his eyes, and the fool who sits on the first cover with a thick mist is in his eyes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is very pleased that the "call" has not been disturbed and that he has not been harbinger of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"‘Sun,’ we met again.” He said with a giant voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick is once again shocked by what happened, lowering his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are A trustworthy fool."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
