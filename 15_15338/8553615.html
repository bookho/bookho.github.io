			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell tower of the East Byron Dock, wearing a clown mask hidden in the deep darkness of Klein has been quietly staring at the dockers’ dormitory, staring at the suspension The airship above it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t see the specific battle process, and he couldn’t know which step in the brick red building progressed, only to be patient, change from the surrounding scene From the black dots that occasionally pass by, to judge whether the situation is good or bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he saw a gas street lamp in that area extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All are extinguished! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is getting dark! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, a feeling that made him impressed to the extreme broke out from the brick red building, even if it was a long distance, Klein endured Can not help but shudder, legs soft, waist down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the essence of looking down and crushing the feeling of living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s impossible to compete against the feeling that you can’t face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, don’t look directly at God... Between them, Klein seems to have returned to the original black backthorn security company’s lobby, as if he is opening a vision I want to spy on the mental state of Mega Gauss and spy on the baby in her belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling is exactly the same as now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it’s more extreme now, it’s more terrible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this? Is Lalhous not the only deity of the "real creator" gift? Add one or two corresponding items at most! How can you get the taste of the evil spirits coming? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein still has to get rid of the tremors of his body and the dislocation of his thoughts, and suddenly he feels a deep, quiet, quiet black engulfing the previous one. Do not snoop on the unstoppable taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two annihilated at the same time, and a gas street lamp around them jumped out of the bright fire, and just couldn’t stop the floating airship to float again. Come up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of them have returned to their original state and there seems to be no change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Klein didn’t think so, he stood up hard and understood the crucial things happening in the brick red building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no longer the feeling that the essence and level transcend the extraordinary, no longer the taste of the evil spirits, which means "real creator", or lang Uth's plan failed...but the night party should have suffered a serious blow, and there may not be spare power... At this time, Klein felt a move and untied the spirit of the left wrist cuff, holding it in one hand, low. Out of the channel:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The current Llanus is no longer dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After repeating it seven times quickly, he opened his eyes and saw that the citrine pendant was rotating counterclockwise, but the speed was not fast and the amplitude was not large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that Lalhous is still a dangerous person, but to a very low degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is more concerned with another point:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divination has not failed again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that Lalhous has been separated from the divine nature given by the “real creator” and is essentially separated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind immersed in the bone marrow, Kleinhodi shuddered, and felt that there was a moment of current coming into his mind from his sole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, what can I do! He suddenly flashed such a thought, no longer hesitated, went four steps back on the top of the dark clock tower, and entered the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t waste time, sat down directly, and showed a yellow-brown parchment with a divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Larrous's escape route."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned back and sneaked into a deep dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that illusory, detached, fascinating world, he saw ditches with sewage, saw dimly dirty passages, and had a root A rusted metal pipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is cramped and closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sewer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wakes up and immediately covers himself with spirituality and falls into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just returned to the real world and immediately stepped back a few steps to the side of the clock tower facing the airship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not take the spiraling staircase, directly flipped out the deep yellow fence, with the platform, bulges and decorations on the surface of the building, layer by layer Jumping down, the body is balanced like walking on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a short time, his feet stepped on the thick street slab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the red brick building, two nights with red gloves Falling to the door, unconscious, the quaint silver-plated mirror rolled to the corner, but no longer has a special special, completely invisible is a "1" seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is obvious that it is recovering little by little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creste. Sesima squatted on the knees, and a line of bloody tears on each side of the eye was slipping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His golden brown short hair pulled weakly, the vertical windbreaker and shirt neckline had become ragged, revealing his sharper chin and thin Hard mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the constant gasping, he has a semi-illusive translucent face with a distorted face on each tooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secima's left palm with red gloves supported the ground, and I struggled straight and looked straight ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is directly on the second floor of the stairs, standing above the ladder with a linen shirt completely open Lalus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhous stood thereright, with a pure white, moist sacred bone sword between his chest and abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh and blood without skin, outlines the flesh and blood of the hanging figure, all disappeared at this time, leaving a hollow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the vagueness, even through this hollow, I can see his back from the front of Llanus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhous moved very hard, suddenly burst into laughter, madly laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Haha, haha, thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really want to thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Really, look at my sincere eyes, I really want to thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it wasn’t for you to find and arrive in time, then for a few more months I really became the carrier of the 'real creator'. At that time, what was the difference between my state and death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sésima heard clearly I can't believe that the guy who was struggling to destroy the biggest reliance was so happy at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to stand at this time, can’t stand up, wants to resist, can’t resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhous saw his doubts, coughing and laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Do you know? For someone like me, after doing something very proud, no one is sharing the most sad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, When I was in Tingen, I was deceived by the 'real creator'. He not only returned by making a child, but also planted a 'sapling' in my body."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I even think that the child of Megoos is only his nephew. He did not even ask the members of the Aurora to protect her and to draw attention. He seems to know this at the beginning. Will fail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His true coming is placed on me. The divine nature that He has given me is suddenly combined with the 'sapling' in my body after I arrive in Beckland. Haha, can you imagine? I am being replaced a little bit. I will be replaced by Him a little bit! By the end, I will become the 'real creator'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not figured out a way, I will be Aurora The people found it according to the divine induction. Fortunately, they are simple madmen with their heads. Haha, there are always so many stupid people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough Keke! Llanus vomited and seemed to have recovered some mobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a hard step forward, and his angular face didn’t know why it suddenly softened a lot, more like the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhous reached out and held the handrail of the stairs, laughing with sarcasm:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Fortunately, the real creator wants to come completely. I want to completely replace me. I need a lot of pessimism, despair, numbness, resentment and primitive evil. Only Beckland, only the Eastern District, the factory area and the dock area can meet His request, this gave me the opportunity to give me the opportunity to contact other people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that the person who simply contacts is not Realistic, because the people I contact are likely to be members of the Aurora."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I first wanted to incite the strike, let the police department notice me, the result was The Aurora people warned that they could only end in a hurry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I installed a little out of control and got a chance to vent to the sewer. In the process, I concealed blood with some living creatures and turned them into ferocious mutant monsters. It is a pity that this matter was discovered by Aurora before you checked it. They seem to have members died in the hands of the mutant monster. Hey, I have no divinity now, no 'sapling'. The blood no longer has this effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After that, I was controlled more strictly, but I still found a chance, I killed A prostitute, with the most cruel methods, wants to attract the attention of the police. Who knows that the Aurora has disguised this case as part of a serial murder case, I still have not been able to wait for the rescue."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have a similar chance, I can only change the more subtle way. I take the initiative to ask the most ferocious and crazy most aggressive Aurora members to look after me, and this is in line with their ideas. Hey, can't they think about it with their brains? This kind of madman will cause trouble at any time, and sure enough, you are here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... At this time, Lan Erus vomited and moved to the body, seeming to finally get rid of the remnants influences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out the sacred sword inserted in the chest and abdomen, and said with regret:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It's a pity, can't take it, or I will be locked and found by you soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure white bone sword completely left his body After that, the exaggerated wound did not leave a drop of blood, and the disappearing part did not seem to belong to Lalhous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lalhous right hand presses the chest and swears to Crestel Sesima and others:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people on the outer airship should recover soon, I can't stay any longer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, thank you heartily." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although you are stupid, they helped me in the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To you guys For the stupid guy, this is your honor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he straightens his body and smiles with a mockery:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goodbye, stupid nights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use your life to send me off." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds the sacred bones sword and slams forward a few steps, trying to stab to Crestel Sesima. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, his eyelids began to become heavy and heavy, and the whole person only wanted to fall down to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that you still have some strength, which is troublesome..." Lanerus bit his tongue and suddenly threw the sacred sword in his hand and cast it The night stunned by the door! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
