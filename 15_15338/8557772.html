			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t answer right or not, stopped at the footsteps of the bedroom, plainly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right right, the problem! There is no question based on pure filth! And, I also made a negative answer." Dani I am pleased to respond and emphasize that I have never admitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gently tapped his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will clarify to your captain." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clarification...Daniz was first dull, then half-mouthed, his expression distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also a well-informed person who no longer defends and refutes, forcibly laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What can I do for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quietly took a breath and used the "clown" ability to control facial expressions:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good monitoring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, good!" Daniz was too busy to agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Greman. Sparo turned and walked to the door of the bedroom, he couldn’t help but blurt out and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You won't find the captain to clarify it again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein twisted the handle and replied with no expression:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good monitoring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he pushed the door inside and closed the room before the corner of his mouth opened. door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used breakfast the next day, Klein put on wide-leg pants The brown thick jacket, wearing a cap, changed into a look, leaving Daniz alone in the room to guard the radio receiver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, Klein changed his appearance again and became more and more like an aboriginal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found a special store, bought gloves made of linen, shroud and a body bag, and then according to the surrounding environment characteristics seen when browsing the prayer screen, all the way I found the bridge hole and found the girl who died in the mud in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is still in winter, the weather is not hot, the body has not shown obvious signs of corruption, but the smell of festering skin and stench still makes Klein instinctively nausea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——He didn’t immediately come to bury this girl who wanted to live like a human last night because of the recent events, Bayam’s night control was abnormal. Strict, and the cemetery has to be bright to open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pulling out a metal vial, Klein poured "Krag's Oil" onto his hand and applied it to the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of stunned people invaded his mind, filled with sterilized water-like mint flavor filled his sense of smell, so that he was sober as if he had just fallen In the ocean where ice is floating, it is no longer affected by another smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning the metal vial, Klein put on the gloves, stepped forward and reached the female body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first unfolded the shroud, involved the other side a little, and then gently put the body into the corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carrying the bag, he deliberately passed through the most prosperous streets of Bayam, went all the way to the city, and climbed along the narrow road that could not pass the carriage. Half of the waist of the seaside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are storm cemeteries and cemeteries prepared by the Governor’s Office for local indigenous people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cemetery of the outsiders who come here for business, adventure, settlement, Luen, Intis, Fenetport, etc. on the other side of Baiam Backed by the woods, it is flat and soothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you want to bury him?" The guardian pointed to the body bag. "If you want to be free, you have to wait a few days, wait until the corpse of the mortuary has reached a certain amount, and then burn it together and bury it in the same grave. There will be a pastor to appease the soul of the deceased in advance, 5 Sule, he will have his own urn and a lattice, 2 pounds, casket plus cemetery plus stone, do not want to cremate, need coffin, can go there to pick, different wood different The price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein thought about it, took 5 Sule's banknotes and handed it over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the name?" The grave guards counted the good banknotes and picked up the dripping pen, asking for a good attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t actually write words, just draw some symbols to help remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kleinton for a second:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buddy."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bud..." The grave guard repeated it in a low voice and drew a symbol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not look up and continued:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She can have an epitaph on the plaid. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buddy is a typical Rosdean native ethnic female name, so the grave guards did not make the wrong gender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein silent for a few seconds, low and open:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is an individual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a person? It’s a strange epitaph..." The grave guard whispered, "Is there a photo? I know you didn't."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not fall, he saw the other party handed a "photo". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Klein’s portrait with a ritual that perfectly recreated the girl’s pre-illness. In order not to be suspected, he used the corresponding paper and The trick is to make the portrait look like a real photo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grave guard was slightly surprised, but did not say much, quickly took the information, and with Klein, the body bag was carried to the priest’s cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until the soul, burning, ashes, photo, engraving, and other things, Klein looked at him and turned away from the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he descended the mountain road, he saw the entire Baiyam:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seawater blue Near green, overlooking, the harbor sails stacked, the chimney is towering, the streets are criss-crossed, people come and go, surrounded by manors, numerous plants, wide roads in the distance, straight rails... this is like a beautiful hand from the master Oil painting, full of vitality, has an indescribable vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the bell tower attached to the Church of the Waves, Cardinal of the Church of the Storm, "Generation "The Penalty" senior deacon, Yann Courtman, is standing on the edge, looking forward to the sea of ​​people and the mountains that spread far and wide along the coastline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Byyam’s pollution level is quite low, because mining, smelting and other industries are in other cities on the island, where the pillars are spice trade, brothels and casinos. It is the aggregation and transit of commodities, and there is no forming industry. Heating coal is used for a small number of days due to the appropriate temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sea King" Yann Courtman just retracted his gaze and saw a "penalty" ran up the spiraling stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord Courtman, there is new information." The "defective" is right-handed and left-handed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Ian Kotman, who was strong, turned and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Calculator" handed over the note in his hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Revolt Inside the military, they got a response from Cavitowan and were shaping a new statue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately looked sideways into the blue mountains of the jungle, like the sea, and sank the following: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for unusual places in the archipelago."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has identified one thing from this intelligence, that is, the mysterious person who took the remaining features of Cavitewa did not leave the waters of the Rothde Islands, which can camouflage Carvey from the other side. Tuva responds to believers and can judge accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Yann Courtman is very clear that the extraordinary characteristics left by Cavi Tuva before the death, whether or not they form a real object, are inevitable. There are serious negative effects that will inevitably lead to anomalies in the surrounding area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he believes that it is not easy for the mysterious person to find the correct seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is found, it will be uncontrollable when responding to prayers, exposing problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the clue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Lord Courtman, the storm is with you!" The "Calculator" once again saluted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you enter Baiyam, Klein is unattended The ability to "no face" was lifted and the carriage returned to the "Azure Wind" hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just opened the door and saw Deniz sitting in front of the radio ticker in a weird and dignified manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the harvest?" asked Klein low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no." Daniz raised his right palm and shook his newspaper. "My bounty, my bounty, ascension Up to 5,500 pounds..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This goes straight to the "Steel" Maviti! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him afraid to go out and drink, he could only stay in the room to monitor the signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of this appreciation is really exciting... Klein didn’t know what to look for, but he could only say without expression:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just the beginning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Shit! Daniz is roaring in his heart, but his face is not afraid of disrespect.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those things are done by Gilman Sparo, how did you increase my bounty? The storm church kingdom military is raised by the blind! He laughs and shakes his face, his face muscles are distorted <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein endured a smile, did not care for him, went back to the bedroom, ready to sleep.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At this time, he saw a letter appearing suddenly, falling from the air, just falling in front of himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein raised his right hand and caught this The letter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger did not reveal this facet, left and left? Klein snorted and read the letter:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...There are two ways to get a messenger. One is to think about an accurate description, to hold a ceremony, to summon the corresponding spiritual creature, to sign a necrotic contract with it, and to enter directly. Spiritual world, looking for the messenger you want, getting it After agreeing, sign a contract with it and record a precise description language for future use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first method is simpler, but quite dangerous, because the description may be a powerful spiritual creature or a strange evil spirit. Every time you call, you It is impossible to be completely sure what will be attracted, and this is the risk that divination is difficult to avoid in advance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The danger of the second method is that you have to find the right one. Couriers are not easy, and there is a risk of being lost in the spiritual world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless you are a traveller, I don't recommend the second method. The first one I can provide some tested 'description', as long as the process is accurate, The level of danger is quite low, but it is not necessarily your satisfaction. In addition, the contract needs to use the power of the Necromancer field, which you can provide with my copper whistle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
