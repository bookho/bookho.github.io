			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you determine your whereabouts, you will get 1,000 pounds! I will meet for the first time!" On the road outside the Fragrant Leaf Bar, Dani I was a little excited and smashed my hand, and I hit the high iron black gas lamppost with a fist. It seemed that I couldn’t wait to go around the city and find the red-haired woman named Elaine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, 1000 pounds is not a small amount, which is enough to make him add another one to Baiyam’s property, but not the most prosperous A valuable neighborhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf flying carpet he had previously obtained is estimated to be two or three thousand pounds, and this is against the "steel" Maviti and the "blood thorns" The harvest of dangerous guys like Huntley is not comparable to the easy task of finding people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walking in front of the side wrapped in a newspaper, spent his full 15 pounds of spell material, slightly slowed down, swept Daniz At a glance, there is no expression to say: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"5500 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Daniz The excitement suddenly solidified on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered an important question. In the eyes of other pirates and adventurers, he was as "tempting" as the red-haired Elaine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others don’t need to fight with him, recognize his identity, report directly to the military, the church, the police, and you may get over 1,000 pounds. Bounty, after all, he is already a big pirate with a value of 5,500 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to find the red-haired Yilian, which is equivalent to the graceful and graceful lady entering the "Red Theater" entertainment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dog...屎...Daniz spits out a word, and the pronunciation in the middle drags it very long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he automatically and consciously lifted the cap and made the front hat lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who poured a cold water on Daniz, resumed normal walking speed and thought about how to find the problem of red hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of media and the necessary information makes it difficult for him to use divination and can only consider other options. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starting a subordinate to do a city-wide investigation? This is something that the church, the military, and the police can do, even if the local gang is difficult to complete...etc. I seem to be able to...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am now 'Poseidon' Cavi Tuva, my followers are all over Baiam, all over the Blue Mountains, I am doing A broadcast, no, to be a god for all believers, let them help me find red hair Elaine... But will this seem too small? For this kind of thing for 1000 pounds, God also wants to face...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I am really 'Poseidon', I will not care about these, but I am In playing Cavia Tuva, we must try our best to maintain the dignity of the gods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cavituva is on the brink of collapse, and it is urgent to find Latsia and her men. I didn’t do the gods broadcast, but I gave some believers to the middle and high level. I can change the law of it. It is a part of reshaping the image, but it can’t seem too low... Well, this should also be true. Claim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Simple to Karat, Edmonton and other gods, it is difficult to organize investigations quickly, and they will inevitably magnify the seriousness of the problem, Things are very big, and the follow-up is not easy to handle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is another way to throw the radio ticker over the fog again, a few days later. Try to contact the mirror Arrodes and ask about the whereabouts of the red-haired Elaine. Be careful, prepare in advance, use divination to determine, and don’t receive strange surprises from 'real creator' or 'original witch' Telegraph, even if I only looked at it, it was mostly crazy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quickly got the idea and boarded a rental carriage parked at the corner of the street. Daniz followed the cap and followed.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the "Azure Wind" hotel, Klein took off his hat and took off his jacket, while facing Daniz:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If your captain has a dream to you, ask about the red hair Elaine's information. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She should not know, otherwise I will not know this red-haired Elaine. "Daniz smirked. "I don't know who is looking for her. I am willing to pay £1,000. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His thoughts fluttered and he remembered a story about the romance of the novels of Russell the Great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at him and inadvertently mentioned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I listened tonight. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You listen?" Daniz looked back and wondered if he had got it wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Klein nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German. Sparo sees me too tired? This guy is crazy, but it is still a good person in essence. When it was in Banxi, for some reason, he decided to take the risk to save people... Daniz secretly sighed a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the radio ticker and the corresponding items, Klein entered the bedroom, locked the door of the house, and threw them on the fog with a sacrifice ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he was not in a hurry to leave the palace of the shackles, beckoning to let the "Poseidon Scepter" fly out of the debris pile and browse the different people. Different prayers made, accumulate thousands of experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the process, he responded from time to time, like a child who is very fresh about toys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Klein’s browsing was coming to an end, the “fool’s seat” suddenly appeared with a swaying aperture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is praying to me, praying to the "fool" instead of "Poseidon"... Klein raised an eyebrow and spread the spirit, browsing the aperture The scenes included. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enmat Harbor, a room with curtains closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edhilan wearing a black classical robes endured the inner impulse, to the sweet girl in front of the young Daniels:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gift of the gods is in us, but to get it, there must be a mentor's guide.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your soul is Pure, is the god's favorite, I will guide you personally, in this process, no matter what happens, you must believe me and listen to me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before that, what do you want to ask?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edhiland is A liar, the best thing about it is to establish a cult to deceive money, and then to decisively escape before the scale is enlarged and noticed by the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he came from Beckland and pretended to be the "fool" leader in the gang of the capital, looking for a "fool" leader, initially developed in the target population A group of believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lied that the "fool" is the embodiment of "the Lord of the Storm" and will come to save the believers at the end of the day. This cannot be widely publicized. The secret of secret communication, otherwise it will attract the attention of other gods in other churches. Only those who are selected can believe in the "fool" in advance, and the first batch is saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to make himself more convincing, he spent a lot of money in Beckland to buy paper with the name "Folly". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the content on paper, his comments are:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looks like real The same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danis asked with some fear and some expectation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Adults, why have we not received a response when we mourn the name of the gods? Are we not the ones who will be bathed in grace?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give you right away. "God's grace"... Ed Shelan took a breath and suppressed the embarrassing picture in her mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two reasons, one is that you have not yet discovered The gift of the hidden spirits in the body, I will help you to complete.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second is that you are not pious enough. Don't argue, I can see through your heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you have done all this, you can remember the true name of the god and get a response, just like me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
