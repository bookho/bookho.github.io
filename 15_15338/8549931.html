			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Klein's look is amazed, An Jieli is a little shaken:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No? Mr. Glacis said that you can only see that his lungs are hidden by observation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more she said the more whispered, she finally closed. mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observation? Black eyebrows? Klein stunned and shook his head and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think Mr. Glacis is misunderstanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; He intended to be so perfunctory, suddenly thought that no one found himself divination yesterday afternoon, resulting in a very unsatisfactory process of playing the "divination", so the brains turned sharply, slightly explained: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is actually a divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Divination? Mr. Glacis only mentioned that you have observed him. The face, this is also divination?" An Jielika asked in surprise and doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein calmly laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a member of the Divination Club, you should know the palm of your hand "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palmistry is not a patent for the big empire. Even on Earth, India and Old Europe have developed a set of theories, not to mention today. It is a world with extraordinary power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know, but you don't seem to show him the palm of your hand? Secretly observing?" Angelica curiously asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I see the face." Kline said, "There is no essential difference between its principle and the hand."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" An Jielika’s eyes were filled with unbelief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, for the development of the "Divination" career, chuckled and pretended to be thinking, raising his hand and tapping his eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze looked, An Jielika’s gas field appeared in his eyes, his head purple, his hands and feet red, his throat blue...healthy There is no problem, only the color is slightly bleak, but this is a manifestation of normal exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at each other's emotions again, only to see a little red and blue in the orange, that is, a little bit of excitement and a little thought in the warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately... It was found that there was no such abnormal situation, and Klein intended to turn off the vision. At this moment, he suddenly saw the emotion of Angelica. Deep in the color, there is a thick gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, she also lacks a little white positive..." Klein nodded thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Moretti, are you looking at my face?" The young gentleman wearing a black formal suit in front of him suddenly silenced and looked at himself seriously, An Jieli Kamin sharply noticed what, half is curious and half asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t answer immediately, and tapped his eyebrows, a look of concentration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When An Jielika was a little uneasy, he spoke softly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms. Jelika, some sadness, some pain, don’t seal it in my heart.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika’s eyes are wide and her mouth is open. But I can't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Klein, who had a half-high hat and a clear academic temperament, and heard the voice of the other person using a low, soothing, warm feeling: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You need a mountain climb, a tennis match, or a sad drama, let the body get tired of exercise, let the tears flow down without cover, then cry , shout, and thoroughly erupt those emotions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also very helpful for your health."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She blinked hard and blinked, and lowered her head, muttering: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your suggestion..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There seems to be a lot of members today?" Klein didn't say much more, just like he hadn't done any divination, looking sideways at the conference room at the end of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sunday afternoon...at least 50 members..." An Jieli’s voice is still a bit dull, and the description is just a few words. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused and her speech rate gradually returned to normal:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want black tea, Or coffee?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xibo Black Tea." Klein nodded slightly, took the hat off courteously, and then walked slowly toward the conference room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he disappeared at the door, Angelica slowly vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divination Club’s meeting room is very large, almost equivalent to Klein High School Double the classroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only five or six members here, which is very empty. At this time, dozens of "diviners" sit in different positions in threes and threes, and they are full. Most of the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines through a few convex belly windows, members may whisper, or ask around Henas. Vincent, or practise, try Divination, or drinking coffee alone, reading the newspaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of picture gives Klein a feeling of returning to the Earth student era, but it was more lively and more awkward at that time, without this quiet taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and didn’t see Glacius and Edward Steve as two acquaintances, so he took the common divination textbook and found it. Corner, read it leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Angelica came in with a cup of black tea and placed it on the table in front of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was about to leave quietly, and suddenly saw Mr. Moretti untied a chic silver chain from the left cuff, with a pure yellow hanging from it. crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is he going to do? Angelica unknowingly slowed down and stared at Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein held the silver chain with his left hand and dropped the citrine pen onto the cup of Xibo black tea, so that it would only come into contact with the liquid surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked calmly half-closed, and the surrounding atmosphere suddenly became quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure citrine is slightly moved, making a clockwise rotation with a chic silver chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Angelica only felt that Mr. Moretti was unusually mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your black tea is not bad." Klein opened his eyes and smiled and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His previous move was deliberately made, deliberately to see An Jieli card! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone wants to find their own divination soon, the Angelica card responsible for reception and recommendation is actually a very important factor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since playing the "divination", Klein no longer has any concerns, really invested in this identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes, Mr. Fanner is very picky about the quality of black tea." An Jielika groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Klein took back the spirit, re-wrapped it, and then picked up the white patterned porcelain cup, and smiled at the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika returned to the reception hall and no longer read the magazine She sat there, staying out of her mind, wondering what she was thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady took off the hat with a pink-blue ribbon and her face was quiet and melancholy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, distinguished lady, do you want to join the club, or find someone to divination?" An Jielika greeted the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to divination." The eyes are beautiful, but the melancholy lady hides her lower lip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika first asked the other person to sit on the sofa, and then detailed the situation of member divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the album and handed it over:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can pick any one "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depressed girl seriously turned up the album, because there are so many members in the club today, the room for selection is too big, see She was upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you recommend one? These pages." She pointed to the middle part of the album, omitting the price above 2 sul and Fortunetellers below 4 pence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika took the photo album and looked at it for a few minutes, saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I recommend this gentleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uneasy lady was fascinated and found a diviner called "Klein Moretti". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Mr. Moretti just joined the club... Is the level trustworthy?" she asked with less confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika definitely nods:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can confirm with one member Mr. Moretti is an excellent diviner. If it is not because he just joined the club, he will not charge such a low fee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." The melancholy lady nodded. "Then I will ask Mr. Moretti for divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, wait a minute." Angelica took it. Atlas, got up and walked to the conference room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came to Klein and lowered her voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moretti, someone Please divination, which divination room do you need to use?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect is good, the first single "business" is on the door... Klein put down the black tea cup, calm Nod: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cream Room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Angelica Stepping forward in the road and opening the wooden door of the citrine room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sat down behind a table with a lot of divination equipment, waited for a few tens of seconds, and saw a light blue dress, low mood and melancholy The woman came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity for the opponent to close the door, he tapped his eyebrows twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The yellow color of the stomach is a bit bleak... The darkness of the emotions is very heavy, worried, uneasy..." Klein looked carefully, and then Rely on, raise your hand and close the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Moretti." The woman in a light blue dress sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, what do you call you?" Klein asked courteously, and did not expect to have an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a keyboard powerhouse, he knows that many people are reluctant to use their real names when they are divining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can call me Anna." The woman in a light blue dress puts the gauze aside and looks at Klein Road with anticipation and suspicion. "I want to divination of my fiancé. He went to the Southland for a business in March. On the 3rd of last month, he reported to me and his family that he was about to sail back, but for twenty days. In the past, he still didn't return. I thought it was the weather of the violent sea. But today, more than a month has passed, and the 'nickname' he took has not yet arrived in the port of Enmat."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
