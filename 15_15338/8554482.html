			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 10 pm, the alley of the back door of the brave bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a black double-breasted long dress, Klein wearing a half-high hat of the same color just turned around here, like the last walk to the nearest The street goes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just walked out of the alley, a carriage stopped in front of him, and behind the glass window, Maric’s pair always suppressed the malicious brown Eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pressed the top half of the top hat, holding a hard cane, calmly and calmly ascended, as if the carriage in front of him was waving himself The same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat down and took care of the bow tie, like a gentleman on the way to the feast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This dress is not suitable for combat." Maric, wearing a white shirt, black vest, tights, looked up and down a few times, pinched and suddenly wrinkled Brows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that he still has some doubts about Klein’s strength, but he chose to trust Sharon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sent a smile with ease:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am different from your extraordinary ability, The style of combat is also different. This kind of clothing does not cause any negative effects. It is even suitable for me. For example, it has a lot of pockets and can hold different items in different places, so as not to take the mistakes in anxious and bury the life. In a ridiculous mistake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he took out the remaining three sedatives from a certain dark bag that was sewn - "pharmacist" modulation Special sedative! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice just fell, and another position next to the car window, quickly sketched a figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wearing a black court dress, wearing a small bonnet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sequence 5 of the heterogeneous route, "resentment" Sharon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You explained too much." Sharon’s blue eyes looked at Klein and said in a whispering tone, “not natural enough.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......I just want to gradually enter the performance state... Klein laughed twice and responded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Probably because I was a little nervous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't wait for Sharon to speak again, he handed the three sedatives to Maric:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You find the opportunity to drink yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that you are definitely more experienced than me, will not drink too early I won’t drink too late, and I won’t drink too little or too much.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric looks at the sealed and transparent glass test tube, gently Shake the liquid inside:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two and a half, more, I will be really calm, I don’t want to do anything in a short time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Clay I liked it and turned to look at Sharon. "Are you sure you have an ambush?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon gently sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are on the way to where we are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not directly disclose the scheduled battle location to Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be very cautious, very careful... Klein thought about it and asked instead:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do you suffer from purification?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Live corpse' will, when I become a spiritual state." Sharon is very simple. Answer the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, when the "hate" of Sequence 5 is still in a physical state, purification is difficult to produce... Klein thoughtfully Asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exterminating evil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunting the Devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he has to deal with the stronger of the same route, Sharon has not concealed:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunting devils can cause harm to our bodies, and exorcism can harm both the body and the spirits, but not fat enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein I sketched my smile and spit out my breath:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it For a moment, consider again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you feel the power to purify and exorcise now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "No." Maric replied hoarsely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very good, the spiritual cage from the variation of the spiritual wall can really isolate the influence of the "sun brooch", but I am so hot... Klein Concealed a sigh, and confirmed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Resentment' Steve, 'live corpse' Jason and 'Wolfman' Tyre, except ' Crimson Moonlight', what other magical items, or extraordinary weapons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't know." Maric once again pinched his eyebrows and looked a little Irritated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the war is over, he will inevitably have some emotional fluctuations in suppressing maliciousness and desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon listened quietly, and whispered in a whisper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jason and Tell are in a state of madness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if they have magical items, they are not sensible to use." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unless it is passive," Maric added. "For the 'wolfwolves', the claw is his extraordinary weapon. I am like this, Thai. This is the case, Jason is also like this, it can cut through the steel and bring its own toxicity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s eyes turned slightly and nodded:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I have no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passer-by has been sparse in the night, the carriage is running fast, The wheels ran over the water from time to time, splashing tiny stains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, Maric let the living body of the car pull the reins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked out of the glass window and saw a dark, cascading place in the ruined building, not far from the sound of the flowing water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a West Bailang dock that has been abandoned for a year, and we are planning an ambush in its warehouse area." Maric introduced . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandoned West Byron Dock...What a surprise, the Tassok River is the best escape route...According to my previous survey, Going out here, about 2 kilometers to the northwest, there is a "leverage church", which belongs to the god of steam and machinery... Klein quickly recalled the surrounding situation. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got out of the carriage, shaped like a leisurely arrangement of clothes, holding a cane, followed Sharon and Maric in the dock that was about to be rebuilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about five or six minutes, they came to an open space surrounded by several warehouses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soil here is dark brown, the dead weeds fall down in various places, and a wooden box is quietly placed in a secluded and dark corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the explosive you want." Maric pointed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s first words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you afraid of a tramp stealing it?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some of my living corpses sleeping in the ground. Once someone enters, they will scare each other away." Maric pointed out a few more Place, "When you bury a bomb, avoid them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Klein nodded lightly and asked, "I am using the ability to purify and exorcise now, will it hurt your little ones?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "No, they are the same as dead bodies, and there is a thick earth barrier." Maric gave a positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Sharon looked around, it’s much harder to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are doing here Your preparation, let's take the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This will not take more than thirty minutes, please grasp the time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you are ready, randomly hide in a warehouse, don't rush to get your hands, be patient."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No matter how dangerous the scene is, it is normal for you to be treated as a normal one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I become weak, 'Crimson Moon' appears, you use that one again 'Eyes' looking for Steve, a sudden attack on him, and I will use my magical items to match you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened carefully, Low smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Simple plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The simpler The more effective the plan is,” Sharon responded calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric pinched his forehead and slammed his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steve is not Stupid guys, and complicated plans will go bankrupt as long as there is a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the exchange, Sharon’s figure disappears instantly, Maric also runs Left the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing them leave, Klein took out a small square iron box from his pocket, which was glued to a layer of spiritual "film", which is from The "spiritual cage" derived from the "wall of spirituality". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can isolate the influence of certain magical items on the outside world to a certain extent, but it cannot improve the negative effects imposed on the holders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the kind of seal that is too strong or too strange is definitely not a "spiritual cage" that can be dealt with. Sealing environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four warehouses, weeds, the ground was muddy because of the previous rain... Klein pulled out a piece of paper and shook it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strip of paper quickly tightened and hard as if it were iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein held the note and quickly dug a shallow hole in the center of the open space, buried the small iron box in his hand, and The outside world was only separated by a thin layer of soil,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he took a piece of explosive from the wooden box and buried it in different corners and different In the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last few remaining, he was buried near the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he took out the revolver and adjusted the proportion of the bullet again, "purifying" 3 pieces and "exorcing evil spirits" 2 pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left wheel was tucked into the armpit of the armpit, and Klein sorted out the clothes, came to the gap between the two warehouses, and lost a paper man there. Throwed on the buried bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around again, then pulled out another square tin box, removed the "spiritual cage" outside, and took out the shape of the sunbird. Dark gold brooch, solemnly put it on the left chest position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein gave a sigh of relief, left here, went outside for a circle, lost some unremarkable things, and ignited and burned it. That note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning, he climbed to the top of a warehouse and hid in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reaching out the points and confirming the various spells, pure dew and herbal powder, Klein touched the iron cigarette case and slammed his finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
