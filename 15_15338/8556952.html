			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has initially figured out the character of Daniz, did not take the initiative to ask what legends, still sitting in the chair, looking at each other calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz, who has not been interrupted, shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legend is in three hundred Years ago, when Lun’s army occupied the island for the first time, more than 500 soldiers were missing after a fog. Not long after, many white bones appeared on the beach and appeared on the mountain, similar. Things happened several times until the Storm Church built a church here and sent a bishop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although historians attributed the official opening of the colonial era to The Russell team found a safe waterway to the South, but in fact, for a long time before, the countries of the North continent explored the surrounding waters and colonized some islands, but these actions were not enough. , not a climate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequently missing in the fog...Bone appears on the beach and on the mountain... Klein inexplicably thinks of the "land of God", according to the small "sun" Description, there is no sun, only lightning and dark nights, and when human beings are "wrapped" by the darkness without a trace of light, they will encounter an event that is either strange or horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniels looked at the lighthouse that was unusually visible in the setting sun and continued: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “And according to the tombs and murals excavated on the island, the indigenous people here seem to have a tradition of eating people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This island is in a region with intense climate change, often It will encounter earthquakes, storms and fog, and this time it will bring disaster to the indigenous people. In order to survive, they began to sacrifice their own "God of the Weather" and held four ceremonies every year. Oh, the content of the ceremony is to kill Remove the selected gods, share his blood and meat, and bury his head in the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, similar traditions have long been replaced by storm ceremonies, and the native indigenous language has disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of the weather...a conquered island that once preserved the tradition of live sacrifices... Klein made a preliminary judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz regained his gaze and said casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of these legends, Banxi has Two unique customs, one is, in the foggy and weather-changing nights, close the door, do not go out, do not respond to the sound of tapping.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The other is that they are fond of the blood of various animals, and learned from the migratory elves to add salt to the inside, let the blood solidify into a strange block, with the local spicy spices, tender and fragrant. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn't that bloody? Klein took a second and turned doubts into frowns:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Elves? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his stereotypes formed in his last life, the elves should be elegant vegetarians, how to study the correct eating skills of blood and one hundred kinds of blood Practice?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, rumors that many elves like to coagulate blood. Daniz answered with a hand. "Unfortunately, it is very difficult to meet this kind of creature that is good at cooking. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The little "sun" has been mentioned, the elf king Sonia Sorem, the ancient god, is the storm authority, the elf family should be The extraordinary person who is the same as the "sailor" approach... Well, it seems that the elves love bloody foods and they are not incomprehensible... Maybe they will generally have the temperament attribute... the picture is beautiful... Klein thoughts The electric transfer gradually shifted his attention to the "blood wang".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not eaten for a long time...he has the idea of ​​disembarking for food.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Daniz took the initiative to propose:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a restaurant in the limestone restaurant, the pig blood is especially famous. Delicious, do you want to try it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always felt that it was dangerous to stay alone in a room with German Sparrow, fearing that the monster in the human skin would suddenly go crazy.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where there are many people, he should be more restrained...the storm is on, hope this journey ends soon! Daniz prays with less confidence.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a pirate, he believes in the same storm, but he lacks enough respect for the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the "flame" proposal, Klein, who had the intention, was so excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the legends and customs that the other party said always made him feel a little uncomfortable, so he took out a gold coin and was in front of Daniz. Made a divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that for him, there is no hidden danger in Banxi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm... Kline looked at the gold in the palm of his hand, and did not remove his eyes for a few seconds, still feeling uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz saw this scene and suddenly realized that the monster in front of him was good at divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... Even if it is stolen, it is easy to find... "Flame" is frustrated, and there is a faint sorrow in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just adjusted his mood, and Klein stood up and walked to the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the gate, Klein turned back with a blank expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can lick this Opportunity to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Klein slammed the door of the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz's palms open and clenched, moved to the door for two steps and finally stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown is the most terrible. Before he figured out the extraordinary ability of Gilman Sparo, he did not dare to risk intensifying contradictions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, at least he is still kind, not materially hurting me... Waiting for Baiam, he should let me go... lucky luck Occupy the mind of Daniz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washing room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pulled out the paper man, made a disguise, and took four steps back into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat at the top of the bronze long table, took off the left wrist and wrote the corresponding divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Banxi Port has hidden dangers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang down the spirit, pose, and after reading it for a few times, Klein opened his eyes. I saw that the citrine pendant was turning clockwise, and it was extremely large and extremely fast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that for Klein, Bansie Harbour is very dangerous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this? It has been colonized by the kingdom for more than three hundred years. It has become an important port on the main trade route. It has been in existence for hundreds of years. There have never been dangerous rumors. Is it a couple of powerful pirates who want to plunder this port? No, that door-to-door anti-aircraft is not a good-looking one... Klein wonders and frowns, re-dividing whether he will encounter piracy-related embarrassment recently, the answer is no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well... He was silent for a few seconds, wrapped himself spiritually, and fell into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the real world, Klein grabbed the mechanical button on the toilet, put away the substitute paper man, went to the washstand next to it, and let the hands wet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this short period of time, he quickly cleared his mind and decided to hide and hide, to avoid it, to stabilize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take out the paper towel and wipe the hand, Klein opened the door and saw Daniz still stay in the center of the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cautious and awkward pirate... In a sense, the "Iceberg Lieutenant" is a part-time pirate adventurer... Klein Looking at each other, plainly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the first class restaurant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Ok.” Daniz didn’t understand why Gelman Sparrow suddenly changed his mind, but eventually chose not to argue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the gangway, the ship, Krivis suddenly Donna and others: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go to the lime restaurant first.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have something to look for, Captain Ireland, and will catch up soon. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. "Uldi Blanche was surprised, but he didn't feel too confused.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crivis re-boarded and met the waist halfway The sword of Elland.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to visit German Sparrow. "Crives left this sentence and turned to the first class area.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan was in a moment of ignorance and did not understand the intention of the other party suddenly coming.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German Spalo does not need to tell me... Elland has been stunned for two seconds, vaguely grasping the true intentions of Krivis.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is telling me if, if he had an accident, it must be because of visiting Gelman Sparrow... but if he has nothing, it shows his The suspicion is wrong, there is no need to disturb German Spalo... Elland stops and talks to the big man next to him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a quarter of an hour. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚!<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kline and Daniz, who are about to go out, heard a rhythmic knock on the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz received a reminder Quickly passed and opened the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just outside of Reeves, he stares at Daniz’s eyes again, and turns his head to gram Ryan Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Flame' Daniz? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At lunchtime, he felt that the friends of German Sparrow were a little bit familiar, but not associated with the photos on a reward ring. After Donna deliberately mentioned Daniz, he suddenly got inspiration and found that the two are very similar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough... Klein is answering the main points, Daniz has already taken the first step and laughed: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friend, you admit the wrong person, although I am very similar to the famous pirate worth 3,000 pounds, but I do It’s not him, there have always been people who misunderstood, and it has caused me a lot of trouble. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein raised his hand and licked his mouth, almost screaming and breaking down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He converges on the expression, calmly replies:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哎...My reputation...Daniz raised his neck and looked at the ceiling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What are you going to do? Krivis silently inhales and asks directly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein twitches his finger and refers to Daniz:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guard him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guard? Krivis can't understand the words of German Sparrow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr., you have to learn your own association, infer that you can't do it in detail. The explanation, this is not in line with my own set! In the face of the doubts of Krivis, Klein said in an understatement: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is on the port of Damir Boat, I recognized him and decided to guard him and prevent accidents. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds with Klein, Krivis clicked on his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No problem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Need help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Klein calmly responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crevis aimed at the depressing Daniz, going backwards:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
