			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good at dispensing pharmacy, treating people, and planting a lot of herbs in the sewer... Is this a "pharmacist"? I don’t know if it’s a member of the Life School or a believer in the Mother Earth? Of course, it’s more likely to be wild... Klein listened thoughtfully and didn’t open his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kingdom of Lun, because the Church of the Storm rejects the eternal sun, the god of knowledge and wisdom, the Church of the Night God and the Church of God of War are incompatible, so foreign religions only The Mother Earth has obtained the right to preach, but under the tacit agreement of the three churches, they have only a few churches, and the believers are pitiful. There is no need to form a team of extraordinary people, even if they are established, they will not To the government's approval, it is impossible to cooperate with the police department and it is "illegal armed." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internal data of the nights recorded that the Mother Earth Church holds the two serial pathways of “cultivator” and “pharmacist”, but the latter seems to be less complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suspected "pharmacist" man was hooded and exposed, revealing a face with an iron black mask, but the mask only covered the area above the bridge of the nose. Let the fat on his cheeks appear clearly and appear to be shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I repeat, I need someone to help me clean up the new beasts in the sewer, just use the Beckland Bridge area, I will pay four bottles of precious The pharmacy is paid, two of which can effectively stop bleeding and promote wound healing. Believe me, this is better than going to the clinic for a suture, and it will work within six months." The man suspected of "pharmacist" said Your own requirements and corresponding conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly laughed and continued to describe:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other two bottles, one and a half months The expiration date allows the man to regain the impulse of being seventeen and eighty years old and become the extraordinary person on the bed. Hey, you know what I mean, even if it exceeds the expiration date, it can also produce effects, but it will extend from there to the whole body. Users will become extremely violent, and their strength, speed and agility will increase dramatically. The amount will be weak after half an hour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it like a utility pole? The old military doctor who posted a small advertisement... and also unscrupulously promoted expired drugs... Kline couldn’t help but swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the man who was suspected of "pharmacist" saw a silence in the living room, and no one spoke, so he had to bite his teeth:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to the four bottles of precious pharmacy, I add an extra 30 pounds!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, one sits on the edge of the sofa The man made a noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks around in a circle, low: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I accept this commission, you prepay two bottles Medicaments, each one, are witnesses by Mr. Eye of Wisdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." An old man on the single sofa nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cheeks on his cheeks are very deep, the skin is slightly dry, and the voice has an old taste. Klein judges that he is a very young man. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." The man suspected of "pharmacist" was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the deal was reached, the party seemed to be a bit more active, and soon there was a woman’s face whose face was completely covered by hood shadows:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to sell two weapons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weapons? Klein adjusted his sitting position and became more focused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not yet promoted, he wants to improve his strength, he can only start from foreign things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One is a rune steel sword, made by the Church of Eternal Sun, with purification and exorcism effects, is an undead creature such as a ghost, a soul, a living dead, etc. The nemesis can still be used for three years. Of course, its sharpness is also enough to kill." The woman’s voice is high and low, obviously disguising the characteristics, "500 pounds, or the sequence of 8 'barbarians' formula, you I can get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good... For me, there is no reason to get it... I really want to meet undead creatures that I can’t currently deal with, blowing The bronze whistle is a better way... Even if you don't look for Mr. Azick, the light messenger should be able to shock many undead creatures... Klein shook his head and listened to the lady introducing the second weapon:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are weapons with extraordinary effects and similar ones without this effect. In terms of pricing, the difference is really big... Klein is watching the follow-up until the rune steel sword is bought by the gloomy man in another corner, and the cleaver becomes The collection of Mr. Wisdom Eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several transactions have been successful, some have failed, Kline’s only heart-warming is the “Financing Accessories”, which can make people’s fortune rise within three months. Extraordinary items, but this is not his main purpose, and the price is quite unbeautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the scene and returning to silence, he slowly vomited and pressed his voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I want to sell an item."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After attracting everyone’s attention, he took out an iron cigarette case and launched the group like jelly. Crimson extraordinary character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without organizing the language, he has already written the draft: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is me I don't know what it does from a corpse. It just seems to be amazing. Maybe some of you know it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g Ryan deliberately did not mention that this is an extraordinary feature, and did not say that the deep red "jelly" in his hand can replace the main material of the "hunter" potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This involves the law of extraordinary character immortality, he does not want to be cheaper members of this extraordinary party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Klein is still holding the idea of ​​temptation to see if anyone knows the law of extraordinary characteristics, such a guy is definitely stronger than others, or more With a background, it is suitable for entrusting bodyguard tasks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he continues to pretend to be an ordinary person who is not familiar enough with extraordinary circles, although the party members here cannot penetrate the iron mask and see his appearance. But Casper Kanlining knows that he looks, and many people in the living room should know the black market weapon trader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful" and "cautious" are words that Klein has emphasized to himself before and after going out today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze looked at the group of crimson things in his hands, but Klein was not an audience and could not tell the specific meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds passed, no one spoke, and the living room was as quiet as a cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the "eye of wisdom" on the single sofa coughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I probably know what it is and how it works, but knowledge needs to be paid for exchange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am out of £400, Believe me, this is an absolutely fair price. Of course, you have the right to refuse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main material of the sequence 9 potion is about 150 to 200 pounds. In total, it takes two pieces, which is almost 400 pounds. The quote is very reasonable... The old gentleman named "The Eye of Wisdom" seems to recognize this sequence of "hunters"... without divination, directly recognize Is it ... is the sequence 7 "identifier" of the "common person" approach? Klein thought about it: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, sir, you don't need I am in a hurry to pay, I have a commission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What entrusted?" "The Eye of Wisdom" is a question of old voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein said at his discretion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things are like this, I offended one, amount According to your circle, it should be sequence 6, maybe the guy in sequence 5, I want to ask a bodyguard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 6, maybe sequence 5? Why don't you die quietly? If we reach this level, why should we participate in a similar small party? The man suspected of "pharmacist" blurted out and was a little smirked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other members of the party did not speak, but from the point of view of no one accepting the task, their thoughts were similar to those of the suspected "pharmacist". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
