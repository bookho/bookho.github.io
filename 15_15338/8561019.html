			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount of Stafford...The court guard of the royal family... From this position, there is indeed a faction of the royal family behind the Bakerland smog Shadow, as for who, to be investigated... Klein can't even try to verify Terry's answer, only to let Seneol sigh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"You told me the clue so easily, which made me a little afraid to believe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry has a bit of ridicule and self-deprecating Said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because this is a good thing for me, I can see that the forces you and your representatives are really plotting against the royal family behind the scenes." I am very interested. If you can provide some effective clues to conflict with them and let the real conspirators come to the surface, I am very happy, this will help me revenge, and it is a great help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this logic, the reverse is also the same, I can also use you to drive you Check this matter and catch the real black hand hidden behind the scenes, so that your power is always hidden in a safe and concealed place before you grasp the effective information... Hey, Terry’s words are not inducing me to do it with her. Limited cooperation, and voluntarily became the "mining soldier" to uncover the truth... She showed the value of her own use... She was afraid that I would finally decide to kill her... Klein roughly understood what Teres really wanted to express. Meaning, manipulating "resentment": <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It makes sense, I should do the same.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I don't think I need to threaten or seduce you, you will try to contact the Viscount of Stafford after the injury has healed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry smacked the corner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only hope that he doesn't like it." the man. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a solution. If you already have sequence 5, consider switching to the "Hunter" route in the sequence 4 "Iron Knight"... Yes, have you forgotten your past self? Why are you getting used to the ability to apply the "funny witch" to deal with men... Klein has a few words in his stomach, and Seignol laughs:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a problem, you can show him your previous photos. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry took a moment and her expression was slightly distorted. There was a kind of shame buried deep in her heart that was dug up and exposed to the sun. The feeling underneath.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her delicate eyes are covered with a layer of anger from the anger, the pale face of the injury suddenly rises red <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry quickly converges on her own emotions, snoring, and whispering:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It is not a 'blood on the top', and there is a deep enough understanding of the witch path. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was not sure before, I thought that the witch sect and the rose school had cooperated, so she believed that "the blood will know" the "Assassin" route The secret, this opened the joke... Anyway, ridiculing the gender of others is not very good... Well, this is quite true for those who are "blood-based". First, "Remember, every person has its own settings." The reason why Tris has just mentioned the previous photos seems to be simply to vent the torture and remove the joy and excitement of an enemy. Didn't pay special attention to the details in the description... Klein took a thoughtful look and manipulated Senegal:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At my level, the general meeting Learn a lot of secrets. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not continue this topic, instead said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I contact you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the process of investigating the Viscount of Stafford, I may be able to provide some help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Terry reached her hand to the ear, grabbed a black and smooth hair, and then the blue icicles condensed and cut down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately spread the palm of her hand, letting the black and silent flames emerge, burning a hairline into ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apply them evenly on the mirror, I know you are looking for me, and I will use that mirror to communicate with you later." Terry shook her wrist and threw the black thing like a mess. Above the blood will be "Senior," which can be used five times, enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Seignor is only a secret, Klein Not worried about accidentally letting him catch the black sticky thing, looked at it and stuffed it into his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry is silent for a few seconds, biting her lower lip:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I need Some help, how can I contact you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a problem... Klein wants to let the other party directly summon the messenger Miss Renee. Anyway, after listening to the current situation of "the blood will be", Teres can know that there is a hidden thing behind this grievance. This is something that can't be hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After considering it for a few seconds, he decided to be cautious and thought that it would not be too late for Terry to find out how to change the contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, this is not a trustworthy person... She revenge for Prince Edessack, maybe it’s true, but most of it contains other purposes, For example, also revenge for yourself... Klein let Señol look around in a circle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sewer has a lot of secrets, I often come over, You can leave the help you need in text here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If things are urgent and you don't have time to do it, you can contact the person just now and let him come. Leave a message here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry slowly nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sees that the exchange is almost complete, ready to let the secret spy Señol leave.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At this time, his "gaze" swept through the hands of Talis and found that the sapphire ring that was comparable to the "0" seal was gone!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I just noticed that I thought she changed her hand and changed her fingertips. The result is really gone... It seems that she was able to escape from the Red Rose Manor of Prince Edsack and get rid of Ince. Zange Weier and the control of "0-08" also paid a lot of money! The mark of "The Original Witch" left on her was gone. Klein thought about it, let "blood Admiral Senigal laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which cult god did you sell your soul to?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry looked deep The middle-aged man in front of him looked at it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Your original Don't you want to get rid of that weird state? Don't you want to be less and less like yourself? How do you walk back? Don't you know that they changed your name to Terry Schik, and there is a purpose to make you a "original witch" container? No, she really didn't know, she didn't even understand the meaning of the title of Chik... I tried my best to escape the fate, but it was further integrated into the fate... Klein was inexplicably afraid of the inspiration for God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reluctantly let Seignol laugh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You answer so easily, very It’s hard for me to believe.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry’s eyes are a little confused, laughing and laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because this is a problem for me, it is not a secret.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than one person knows, maybe there will be more hope for solving the problem, even if this hope is very Oh, but it’s better than nothing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a high probability that the problem will be solved at the same time... Klein didn't say much, thought: <br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you are close to Viscountford, close to the guys behind the scenes, pay attention to whether you often encounter coincidences. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
