			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precipitating a good mood, Klein went underground and came outside the door of Chanis, ringing the open door of the guard room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Yao. Lai Ting sitting inside, picking up his personal belongings early, seeing the shifter arrive, immediately took care of his hair, got up and ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After bowing to each other, Klein suddenly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mastered the potion The progress is good, just shared their experience with Fry, you can talk to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the other side, Luo Yao looked at the other side with amazement. The lips moved a few times: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms., I hope you wait It’s also able to maintain this calm state... There’s a bunch of wood people sitting in the recreation room... Klein smiled and came to the back of the table, picking up the silver inlaid with Dunn Smith’s Fermer coffee. Tin cans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making a cup of fragrant coffee, Klein sat down leisurely, looking at the silent aisle outside the door, letting his thoughts fly: < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that Mr. Azke’s actions are going well, don’t leave any clues... No, even if there are any clues, I will pretend not to find..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know where the 'variation of the Sun's Emblem' is sealed behind the door of Chanis... Well, it doesn't have the characteristics of living, leaving plenty of room That's it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking, I haven’t been to the Chanis Gate until now, I don’t know the state... I can make that big and small. Oddly, dozens of seals do not cause damage. They are not unusual from the supervision. For example, the ashes of Saint Serena?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of thoughts, Klein suddenly heard the rapid footsteps, busy to withdraw their attention, looking to the door<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the old Neil wearing a black classical robes and holding the same colored felt hat in the hallway, and quickly entered the guard room, standing opposite, a word If you don't say it, look at yourself up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Mr. Neil, what happened?" Klein grinned twice and took a sip of the fragrant coffee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil looked at him again and sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You turned out to be I found inspiration from the mystery of 'The Secret Man' and Dai Li's case..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This must praise the goddess and thank you for your teaching." Ryan replied in a serious manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil pulled the chair and slammed down and said with a slight sorrow: "If, if it is twenty years earlier, it will be fine." Just fine..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that the other person’s age and physical condition have not allowed him to take the potion again, even if he completely digested the previous one, gram Ryan kept silent and didn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that in this case, what is said is to stimulate each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I first tried to find out the idea of ​​quickly mastering the potion from the esoteric motto. Unfortunately, I have not been able to get to the right path. Later, Dai Li’s success gave me revelation, but at that time I was over 50 years old and had given up my efforts. The subconscious thought that it was a special genius, and normal people could not imitate it.” Old Neil smashed the forehead, low. Describes his own loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He silently lifted his head for a few minutes and looked at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" People regret that I didn’t understand what I missed at this age.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil’s cognition of “playing the law” should be a bit vague I shared the experience and I immediately wanted to understand something... Klein comforted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe the church has... no, if they have, at least the name will be told to the branch... The underground trading market is not impossible..." Neil whispered a few words, held the table by hand, shook his head and stood up. Smiled and said, "At least I have not lost control. I have lived a healthy life for decades. I like beautiful women."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He painted a red moon on his chest, expression Deviated from the guard room, lost the usual embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein watched his back disappear into sight, and suddenly sighed long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is increasingly unable to understand why the church’s top executives are blocking the “playing the law”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Klein returned and turned his attention to the internal data of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since pulling the teenager of the Silver City into the Tarot Club, knowing that there are still many ancient things in it, he has consciously strengthened learning in similar areas. Try to grasp the comparison of ancient and modern names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, he heard a footstep, a gentle and steady footstep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, his mind showed the appearance of Dunn Smith wearing a black over-the-knee trench coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thoroughly digested the "Divination" potion, and my inspiration improved. Klein nodded thoughtfully and saw the captain in a few seconds. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your letter." Dunn raised his right hand, his wrist fluttered, and the letter in his palm was still to Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein raised his hand and tried to catch it, but it was a little worse regardless of judgment or reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter fell to the ground, and Kline’s right hand was erected in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sudden and quiet atmosphere, his right hand first froze, then continued to lift, and took care of his hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The light of the gas lamp is still not bright enough." Klein casually perfunctory, bent over to pick up the letter and swept the envelope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Hornachs...Dast Gudrian’s letter...He nodded, pulled the drawer and took out the letter cutter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——According to the rules of the Night Squad, if there is a clear and correct recipient, Luo Shan and other civilian personnel will directly submit the letter to the corresponding person. If you encounter anonymity or check that there is no such person, you will be sent to Dunn, who will ask or decide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully cut the envelope, Klein pulls out the paper inside, quickly expands and browses again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that the madhouse doctor Dast was on request to meet as soon as possible, which is two o'clock this afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got the "reader" formula? Or is there something else? Klein raised the stationery in his hand and looked up at Dunn Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, my informant, that is, the psychological alchemy club, hope that in the afternoon two Point to meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the disclosure?" Dunn asked as expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Klein shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng thought about it, the voice said mellowly: "Wait for Leonard to help you guard the Chanis Gate, I followed you, hidden nearby." This urgent meeting request is not a small trap. I have seen too many similar things, and if there are important situations, this can be done as quickly as possible."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Captain, you are really experienced... Well, once you have a business, you are a reliable, trustworthy, and will not forget the captain... Klein nodded immediately:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 2 pm, the Zotland Street Shooting Club, in the small shooting range on the 9th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at the bullet-filled target and looked at the slightly disturbed madhouse doctor Dast Goodrich: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened, even let you panic and go to the hound pub to find a mercenary squad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way, the hound The owner of the pub, Wright, immediately delivered the letter to the Blackthorn Security Company, instead of waiting for Klein to take it himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dast observes Klein’s subtle expressions and physical movements, and screams:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I feel that Hood Eugen has been somewhat abnormal recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hood Eugen is the one who developed Dust as a member of the psychological alchemy club Crazy hospital patients. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the abnormal performance?" Klein asked very professionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dast is secretly relieved and seems to have found a reliance, discretion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" He, he seems, it seems really crazy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really crazy?" Klein asked. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hood. Eugen is not trying to exercise the corresponding ability in the spiritual field, only to sneak into the madhouse, trying to influence those patients from both positive and negative aspects? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is really sick, really crazy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so..." Dastillo walked back and forth a little anxiously. "I was able to communicate with him normally and get how to use it properly." The teaching of ability, but in recent days, his thinking, his state, has become very strange, often no way to communicate, just like I am facing other patients, although, although this also made me successful in getting ' Reader's formula, but I can't confirm whether it is true or fake, and I am more afraid of uncontrollable changes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't matter, as a Divination, a diviner with a mysterious space above the fog, true and false will not be confused... Klein first breathed a sigh of relief, then frowned and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Who did he contact before he appeared abnormal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only those patients, I, I am not sure, I am not every hour of every day They are all in the madhouse, and I have time to rest." Dast answered with a calm expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gently beheaded, this is a small thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to be nervous, I will send someone to protect you secretly. You can figure out who Hud. Eugen had contacted before. In addition, you must be careful that he is testing you. You should best inform this time to other members of the psychological alchemists. See what happens to the top management of your organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Dust pushed the gold-rimmed glasses and restored the audience’s unique calmness, then I took out a piece of paper in my pocket and handed it to Klein. "This is the recipe for the 'Reader' potion. I am not sure if it is correct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will verify it." Klein replied with a smile and saw it on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Main material: the complete pituitary gland of the adult colorful lizard, 10 ml of the spinal fluid of the Farsman rabbit."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Auxiliary materials: 5 grams of chestnut spores, 8 grams of dragon tooth grass powder, 3 petals of pure white elf, 100 ml of pure water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Great." Klein praised it and folded the paper and placed it in the pocket on the inside of the tuxedo suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicating a few more words, confirming that Dust’s “illusory audition” phenomenon has been alleviated, he left his mind and cautiously came to the exclusive shooting range of those who belong to the night. Dunn Smith is waiting inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, the informant gave me a recipe for 'Reading the Heart', thanking me for helping him control the counterfeit of the potion, but he is not sure about this. The recipe is true and false.” Klein seriously and seriously handed the paper to Dunn. “In addition, he mentioned one thing...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
