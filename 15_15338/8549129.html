			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui was scared by the sights in front of him, and it seemed that he was not himself, but a dry body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can someone with such a serious wound still be alive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t believe that he had turned his head and checked the other side. Even if the distance was long and the light was blurred, the existence of the wound and the deep red blood could still be seen. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui took a breath and tried to calm himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out to the left chest and felt the heart beat vigorously and vigorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And touched the exposed skin, a little cold cover is a warm hooligan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, after verifying that the knee can still bend, Zhou Mingrui stood up again, no longer so confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" He frowned and tried to check the wound on his head again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two steps forward, he suddenly stopped again, because the blood of the moon outside the window is relatively bleak, not enough to support the "seriously check" this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fragmentation of a memory came out, and Zhou Mingrui turned to look at the gray pipes and metal grids on the wall next to the desk. Wall lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the current mainstream gas lamp, with stable fireworks and excellent lighting effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original family situation of Klein Moretti, not to mention the gas lamp, even the kerosene lamp should not be expected, the use of candles is the performance and status But four years ago, when he stayed up late to study and struggled for the entrance exam of Hoy University, his brother, Banson, thought that this was an important thing in the future of the family. Even if he borrowed money, he would create good conditions for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Banson, who has worked literate for several years, is definitely not a reckless, lacking means, and does not consider the consequences. He is "helping to install gas pipes." Improve the grade of the apartment, which will help the future rental. For the reason, Mr. Fangdong paid for the basic transformation, and he used the convenience of the import and export company to get the new gas lamp near the cost price. I used savings and didn't find someone to borrow money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debris flickered past, Zhou Mingrui returned to the desk, opened the pipe valve, twisted the gas light switch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒哒哒, the sound of friction ignition sounded, but the light did not come as Zhou Mingrui expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒哒哒! He twisted a few more times, but the gas lamp was still bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm..." Retract the hand, hold down the left temple, and Zhou Mingrui takes the memory debris and finds the cause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, he turned his body and walked to the door, to the front of the mechanism that was also mounted on the wall, also with gray pipes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a gas meter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing a little bare gear and bearings, Zhou Mingrui pulled out a coin from his trouser pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a dark yellow color, glittering copper, and a man's head with a crown on the front, and a "1" character behind the wheat ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui knows that this is the most basic currency of the Kingdom of Lun, called the copper penny. The actual purchasing power of 1 pence is roughly equivalent to three or four dollars before the crossing. There are also three kinds of coins, five pence, half pennies and one quarter pennies, but they are still not fine enough. In daily life, they still have to buy items from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the copper penny issued by King George III in his hand, he flipped a few laps at his fingertips, Zhou Mingrui glared at it and stuffed it into the gas meter. The slender "mouth" of the device is opened vertically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the penny fell inside the meter, the sound of the gears of the clicks sounded, playing a short and wonderful mechanical melody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui stared for a few seconds, then returned to the wood-colored desk and reached out and twisted the gas light switch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒哒哒,啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cluster of flames ignited and quickly became bigger. The bright light first occupied the interior of the wall lamp, then passed through the transparent glass, and the room was covered with warm colors. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness suddenly shrank away, blush quit the window, Zhou Mingrui inexplicably reassured a few points, and quickly came to the front of the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he carefully examined the position of the temple, not letting go of a little detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several comparisons, he found that in addition to the initial blood stains, the wounds of the cockroaches did not flow out of the liquid, as if they had the best hemostasis and dressing, and that slowly The creeping gray brain and the wounds that grow at the speed of the naked eye indicate the healing, perhaps thirty or forty minutes, maybe two or three hours, where there will be only shallow traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The therapeutic effect of crossing?" Zhou Mingrui curled up the right corner of his mouth and whispered silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he took a long breath, no matter what, at least he was a living person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the mind, he pulled the drawer, took out a small piece of soap, took one of the worn towels hanging from the cupboard, and then opened the door. Go to the common bathroom of the second floor tenant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the blood on the head has to be dealt with, lest you always look like a crime scene, it doesn’t matter if you scare yourself, if you scare the younger sister who gets up early tomorrow. Melissa, that's not going to end! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corridor outside the door is dark, only the blushing moonlight from the end of the window barely outlines the outline of the things, making them look like a deep night watching silently A pair of double monster eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui puts a light footstep and is quite awkward to go to the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the inside, the moonlight is more prosperous, everything is clear, Zhou Mingrui stood in front of the washstand and unscrewed the tap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦,水声耳, he thought of the landlord Mr. Franche. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the water fee is included in the rent, the top hat, the inner vest, the black jacket, the short and thin Mr. is always actively visiting A bathroom, eavesdropping on the sound of running water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the movement is louder, then Mr. Franche will disregard the gentleman's grace, fiercely waving his cane, hitting the door of the bathroom, and yelling "damn The thief!" "Waste is a shameful thing!" "I remember you!" "Let me see it again, take your dirty luggage and get out!" "Believe me, this is the most in the city of Tintingen." A cost-effective apartment, you can no longer find a landlord who is more generous than me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recovering thoughts, Zhou Mingrui wets the towel and cleans the blood on his face ,again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait until the tattered mirror in the bathroom, confirming that only the wounds and pale face are left, Zhou Mingrui relaxed a lot, then took off A linen shirt with blood spots on the soap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, his brow wrinkled, remembering that there might be other troubles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wounds are exaggerated and the blood is numerous. In addition to the body, there should be traces in the room! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Zhou Mingrui handled the linen shirt and took a wet towel and walked back home. He wiped the blood fingerprint on the desk and then relied on the gas lamp. The light, looking for other residues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This finds, he immediately found a lot of splashed blood spots on the floor and the bottom of the desk, and the left hand wall, there is a yellow and clear bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...When the left wheel hits the temple and fires a shot?" The front and back clues ran through, and Zhou Mingrui probably understood Klein's death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
