			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't peek at God..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" hangs down" Alger's whisper is very It quickly subsided, but in the ears of the people, it still reverberates, reminding them of a fact:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mr. "Footer" usually has no shelf, rarely The opening is almost responsive, giving people a feeling of being more moderate, but He is always a god, a god that cannot be peeked, a god above the reality! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Justice" Audrey, "Moon" Emlin and other members of the Tarot Society, the instinct accepted the change of the "inverted man" I pretend that I don’t remember that the sentence should have been “not directly looking at God” because they often look at Mr. “Foolish Man” from time to time to ask questions or seek advice, and Mr. “fool” does not seem to mind this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there is no direct view, because there is a strong fog barrier... Look at the way the "hidden" lady just said, "Mr. Fool" is this We are so good... "Justice" Audrey spit a little slowly and slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the idea of ​​"fool" Klein is:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' Mr. Man is very cooperative. I am preparing to manipulate the 'world', say similar words, and complete the final step of the tap..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally felt that he was allowed to leave When people "world" point out "the god can't be deceived" or "the god can't peep", it will be quite embarrassing. If you know that the so-called "world" of the so-called "world" is actually the "fool" trumpet, then you will not see yourself. People, but then thought about it, "the world" seems to have done similar things long ago, not bad, and, do not let people know not to do it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After removing the psychological barrier, Klein is preparing to follow the rehearsal content one by one, who knows the actual situation is better than he expected, "downside down" It seems that the process of being beaten by the "hidden" shocked the mind and took the initiative to say "not to peep at God" for him. The overall effect became more natural and perfect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm... "The Hidden" leaked the question of Tarot’s intelligence. The "fool" simply clicked on it and made a warning with an implication. Subsequent encounters stem from a peep into the gods, not the "fool" intentional...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the result I most hope to achieve, which is the most effective maintenance The image of "fool", after all, the gods will not care about the mortal, this is too much...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the "hidden" lady is also acting style I’m too bold, I found out and confirmed today that she’s not peek at the “fool” twice, although it’s not malicious, but it’s worth fighting. Oh, my previous reaction made her think that I’m Accomplished her "gaze", so she developed a habit, and as a result I expected to hit the muzzle...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, to "Mr." If the attitude is not sure, she will give the outside hint directly, and she will be daring. This shows that It’s not enough to suffer, the lessons of today should be enough for her to remember for a long time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about the state of her dreams, it seems to be quite normal... Do not teach, Mom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, today is also by the way, knocking on the "downside down" Mr., beat other members? Klein laughed silently, whispering a word, looking around in a circle, saying: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this sentence, the "hidden" Jia Delia, who had just recovered from the spirit, relaxed, and felt that she was so tired and glad that she was just going crazy, so she only wanted to find Zhang Anle chair. Lay down and rest for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time is a warning, the second time there will be no good ending... The pirate general sighs and warns himself not to play with cleverness. Don't think that your suggestion can win the "fool", and don't have any thoughts to peep at him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain just now is not as weak as her insulting the knowledge of the "hidden sage", so she undoubtedly believes that "fool" In essence, it is a god, a true god, an unmeasurable god that cannot be peeped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a silence, she said sincerely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember your tolerance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "fool" Klein gently decapitated and no longer repeated the previous words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short wait, "Magic" Firth grabbed the "justice" Audrey, straight back, looking around:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, are you interested in taking a murder mission?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goal is an important member of the cult organization. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the love of the teacher Dorian Gray, Firth has always thought about doing something for the other person.<br /><br />&nbsp After consideration, she targeted the Aurora, who was once a serious injury to the teacher's family, perhaps the "record officer", perhaps the "traveler" Louis Wien! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not expand because she got "Le Mano’s travel notes", thinking that she could kill an experienced sequence that is good at escaping, even Sequence 5 is extraordinary. The reason why she has similar considerations is that the hidden organization behind Tarot will provide help that others can't imagine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms., "Mr. World", it seems that they all have the ability to compete with Louis Wien. One of them, and I used "Le Mano's travel notes" to help, it is not impossible to succeed... "Magician "Firth outlined the most ideal situation in his mind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, she knew that her current deposit was not enough to cover the cost of killing Louis Wien as a powerful person. After all, 830 pounds could not be bought with the other hand - she knew very well that Audrey Hall In order to kill Ambassador Intis, a sequence 6 "conspirator" spent more than 10,000 pounds, and the same sequence or even higher sequence of Louis Wien can be imagined!<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falth’s plan is to promise the task takeover a series of commissions to repay, that is, to help the other party to do something inconvenient to do to deduct the cost of the task, she wants to come With the "Lymanno travel notes", I still have the ability to do some difficult things.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the "Magic" Miss's request, "hidden" Jia Delia, "downside" Alger and "justice" Audrey also turned their attention to the "world", in their view, this gentleman has a special for the extraordinary hunting Hobbies, and have enough abilities.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;I am not in Beckland...but I can’t respond like this, or else I’m going to expose the “fool” may be only two or three of the best in front of the “inverted man” and the “invisible” lady. The truth is... Klein manipulates the "world" and integrates into the senses of the other party, snoring and laughing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where? What organization? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequences? What are the characteristics of the ability?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咦, "World" and before It’s a bit different... I don’t know what it’s like, it’s like his mood suddenly becomes better. Maybe, he really has something to be happy about... “Justice” Audrey’s sudden discovery, enthusiasm I guess what good things Mr. World has encountered in the recent period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Firth responded with delight: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is the Aurora The god of the gods, in Beckland, formerly sequence 6, may now be sequence 5, but not sure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can record the extraordinary ability that others have used And use it once, it is good at getting out of trouble, it is difficult to be surrounded, and maybe it can also carry out the spiritual world shuttle..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal is the Aurora, the sequence 6 or Sequence 5, the ability to approximate the "apprentice" approach... Sure enough, the "Magician" Miss is not as ordinary and simple as it seems, my initial judgment is correct... "The Hidden" Jia Delia quickly recovered the status, It’s no surprise that the “magician” dared to figure out the aurora meeting with Mr. and Mrs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the gods, she is not clear because she Only Mr. Z and Ms. D are familiar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aurora will make there is no innocent possibility. Anyway, it is a madman who is maiming life. If you kill it, you will not feel guilty...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offensive Aurora The thing that I did is not a two-piece...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sequence 6 or Sequence 5, in the range I can handle... "Magic" The extraordinary ability of the record described and released by the lady, I seem to have seen it, Mr. A has used it, but it is not necessarily true...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, He is good at escaping and can shuttle through the spirits. He doesn't have to care too much. As long as he can get close to the sacred ambassador and successfully manipulate his "spiritual line", he can't run! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frontal confrontation, the result is difficult to say, I have a lot of confidence in the raid, of course, whether it is successful to raid is another matter...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After serious thinking, the "world" looks back to the "magician" Fols:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can Consider taking over, but not recently, at least two months later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not sure if there will be an accident at sea, so the time limit is more relaxed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two months later..." "Magic" Firth repeated the time hesitantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been too long, she’s not sure when Louis Wien will stay in Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the onlookers of the "downside down" Alger discretion: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Magician, do you have to kill the Aurora by yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you see me thinking about whether please Mr. 'World' helped me.” Fols smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger seems to be thinking in the end:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The premise of killing is to find Get the ambassador, can you find it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, but I will investigate.” “Magician” Foers answered calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you have the results, let the ‘world’ start?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but I haven't decided yet." Fols was a bit stunned and didn't understand the intent of the series of questions "Mr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger immediately screamed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can be sure The aurora will make the whereabouts of God, why do you have to pay a big price to kill him? Is it not okay to report directly to the church? After the smog incident, no church is willing to let go of similar clues."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not trying to undermine the "world", but obviously hears the "magician" Miss hesitate, thinks that she may not be entrusted the most, after two months A lot of accidents can happen in time, so give some advice and let things be finalized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Report to the church? This sounds familiar to me... Kline’s stunned, I didn’t think that “slowing people” would say that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, everyone was infected by the "inverted man", he was also affected by us... Klein immediately relieved, quite pleased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reporting?" "Magic" Firth stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, she whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes can..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"""""" Look for his whereabouts. If there is gain in two months, give it to the church. If it is more than two months, Mr. World is free, let him help. What do you think?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
