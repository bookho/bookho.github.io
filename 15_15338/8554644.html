			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the luxury carriage of Earl Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke is chatting with Mrs. Mary just a prominent guest, such as the Chairman of the Air Pollution Investigation Committee, the Director of the National Weather Service, Sir Desshaw, such as Member of the Air Pollution Investigation Committee, President of the Wang Family Meteorological Society, Member of the House of Commons, Mr. Kef, such as the director of medical health in the county, and the famous doctor, Mr. Haxley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all have a wide-ranging influence in the government, the royal family, or the House. The final report of this committee will become the scheduled Anti-Pollution Act. The most important basis for the Flue Gas Emission Reduction Act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Coim Company, which specializes in anthracite and charcoal, is trying to push and accelerate this progress, leaving those old but huge competitors out of transition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will definitely not smash the Golden Pound, they will definitely lobby those heavyweights to interfere with our investigation. We must have a clear response. As Mr. Hibbert Hall said, we have to grasp the paradox and let newspapers and magazines repeatedly promote the terrible pollution of smoke..." Luke is a senior manager of Coim, and is the important shareholder of Mary. Assistant, and he is quite capable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the chats, Luke suddenly noticed that his wife sat next to him but said nothing, just like losing his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starling, what happened?" Luke asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starlin came back and smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing, just some I am tired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, seeing so many big people, your spirit must have been highly tight, and now you can finally relax, fatigue is normal. Things, in fact, I am the same." Luke smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starlin did not respond to him, but looked out the window and looked at the park with the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her ears are still vaguely echoing the inadvertent words of the previous aristocratic girl:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" £450.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A trained hound, the price is between 450 and 700 pounds.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver City, the bottom of the round tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick Berg has been trapped in a small room, eating and taking medicine on time, his mental state is getting better, auditory hallucinations and illusions are no longer Reappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day or two, I should be able to go out... I am always in such an environment, I am really panicked... The leader of the exploration team next door I was locked up for forty-two years. I was still very awake and rational. If I changed it to be me, I must have been crazy... However, the things he explored and the strange monsters are very attractive and even terrible... ...Dyrick sat on the edge of the bed and looked at the candle that had burned to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the caretaker delivers the next food and potion, he will be in real darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, his face was filled with fog, and the voice of the "fool" sounded in his ear:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare for the party."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change is fleeting, and Dairik regains his attention and subconsciously counts the heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he quickly discovered that this was not necessary because his current status is solitude and does not need to avoid others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derek, who no longer counts his heartbeat, quickly thought of a question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s I am now in the seal of the magical item at the bottom of the round tower. Will Mr. Fool’s move to pull people into the fog will be discovered and detected? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of uneasiness and uneasiness, Dairik, who had never been able to make a decision, saw a boundless red glow in the void, and saw that they were just a rush, drowning themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a quiet room in a small, closed room, and even the breathing is weak to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the sound of Dick and the metal wall of the former exploration team captain made a "beep" sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the secret sign that the two seek to chat with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"笃!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opposite the fingers and knocked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the third long time that should have been continued soon did not appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the voice of "笃" was hesitated again. Then, both rooms fell into silence, and there was no movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey, who ended the luncheon, practiced the piano, 掐Time to return to your bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing through the study of her father, Count Earl, she saw the door half-covered, with a stack of thick documents on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing before..." Audrey was curious, slowed down, and gave a look to Golden Retriever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi, who is a "audience", often needs a little hint to understand what the owner wants to do, and of course, it occasionally Pretending not to understand, just willing to lie down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Susie, who received the secret code, trotting silently, slid into the study, and then explored the two front legs, held on the edge of the table, and stood upright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It quickly glanced at the front page of the stack of documents, returned to Audrey and lowered the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Investigation on the living conditions of all levels in the Eastern District, Docklands and Factory Districts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Audrey, what does this mean?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey of living conditions at all levels in the Eastern District, Docklands and Factory Districts? Why did Dad suddenly do this investigation? I remember that I did not mention similar things to him... Audrey was puzzled for a while and did not care to answer Su Shi’s question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked around and saw the servants each, not paying special attention to themselves, so she raised her head and calmly turned into the study of Earl Hall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After coming to the desk, Audrey looked down at the investigation report and found that the title was indeed consistent with Su Shi’s description. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it’s a typewriter. The investigator is a reporter named Mike Joseph. There is a goddess of the goddess... This is the goddess church client. made? Why do you want to give Dad a copy? Hey, Dad is a believer in the goddess. Does the church want him to give some support in this matter? This is a good thing... Audrey made a preliminary judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She originally had the idea of ​​asking someone to do similar investigations, but felt that this did not meet the intention of her own implicit guidance, it is easy to show the sense of existence, no longer being used by other nobles Ignore, so I have been hesitant to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey reached out and flipped through the documents and found that the report on the Eastern District, the Docklands and the Factory District was not only a copy of Mike Joseph, but also many people. A field survey was conducted from different angles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of them even mentioned the spread of cults, and some extraordinary people colluded with gangs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Audrey looked at the wall clock in the study room and saw that it was close to three o'clock. He gave up the intention to read it carefully and restored the document to its original state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before she went out, she took the book and disguised it as a purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At three o'clock, the knocking sound of the wall clock is still echoing. Audrey has appeared in the majestic palace in the dark red and illusory light, appearing on the side of the ancient long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sketched her smile and got up to the top of the first line:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon, 'fool' Mr.~"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving a gentle decapitation, she greeted the "inverted man", "world", "magician" and others, and was keenly It seems a bit uneasy to find the "sun". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you worried about?" Audrey asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes it clear that Klein, who is in the wrong state of the small "sun", does not need to speak for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In advance into this mysterious space, he slightly packed up the items placed on the table, the Aziz copper whistle, the biotoxin bottle, the spiritual squad The things were thrown into the corner and completely covered with thick fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the desktop in front of him is only covered with a "black emperor" card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an item that matches the "fool" status! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik did not conceal, immediately "sick" himself, and was sent to the bottom of the round tower for isolation and treatment. At the end, I asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr., will that magical item find me attending the Tarot Club?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I know...I don’t even know what it is...but there is nothing or a strange or powerful force trying to invade... Well, even the "eternal glory" and "The real creator" couldn't find it here... Kline's fingers tapped on the edge of the bronze long table, and the answer was "easy": <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Normally, It can't be found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But some magical items have peculiar effects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Mr. "fool" gave a positive answer, and Dairik was relieved a lot. He sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if it has "The strange effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is one of the top secrets of Silver City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, he suddenly remembered the thing that the former exploration team leader said, and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ever heard of Amon?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amon? Klein thought about the source of familiarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not rush to answer, but turned his attention to the "downside down", he is very clear that the middle of the storm church also knows "Amon" And maybe I know more than myself. Similarly, "Justice" Audrey also looked at the "downside down". She heard the name last time, just from the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Magic" Firth listened with a stunned look and always felt that the things discussed here were outside the scope of their knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger frowned and asked in confusion: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "In the process of exploring the surrounding area, did you encounter a person who claimed to be Amon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or, found a similar record?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik seriously nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, forty-two years Before, there was a squad of expeditions who met a self-proclaimed Amon in the dark. After returning to the Silver City, they went crazy and lost control. Only one left, was locked at the bottom of the round tower, just next to me. "#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, he is also crazy, that is just a delusion..." "Magic" Foers made a guess with his rich experience in novel writing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
