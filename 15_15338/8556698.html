			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "moon" that was stared at by a gaze was a little overwhelmed and vaguely understood that he seemed to ask questions about what should not be asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I do what I do, I am not allowed to have a blood family friend? Do you want to explain two sentences... No, what happened to the blood family? I am a blood family, there is nothing to admit! Our blood family has a long history, a long life and a rich accumulation. It is a noble race! You are not particularly powerful. The most recent transaction is a sequence of 6 levels of items! During the flash of thoughts, after several changes, Emlin White raised his chin and proudly added: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am a pure blood family." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody asked him if he was... "Moon", this is a bit guilty, so he made a radical reaction... "Justice" Audrey reading Emlin's performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really blood... "Magic" Firth curiously asks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Sir, do your blood races follow the human race, and divide the titles of the male Houbozi men to identify the different levels of strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, It’s your human beings who imitate our blood race!” Emlin sat down straight. “Before the Cataclysm, as early as the Second Age, our blood races had the division of the male princes, but they did not fully control their own strength. Adult blood family, I am an adult, and then I can get the baron's title, and then go up until the Duke, the duke is the position of the queen and the prince. At that time, you humans still Under the rule of the giant Wang Ting, it is impossible to invent the title!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice just fell, next to the "Sun" Dairik excused and debuted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no such record in the history of our Silver City.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The division of the blood family is based on the birth of the first 'stone slate'. It was previously vague, only different family patriarchs, different regional leaders, etc., the top is the ancestor Lily Silk, then strictly corresponds to the potion system, named according to different sequences. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moon" Emlin responded dismissively:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our blood History is written with a long life, not a small, ordinary silver city can be overthrown. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, they always mention Silver City, where is the Silver City? I have never heard of it... After the rebuttal, Emlin I found out that I seem to have overlooked any important issues.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our Silver City will not make up history, our records are derived from ancient books that can be verified or the ruins of other city-states. . "The Sun" Dairik has some grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no one stops, I think they can argue on this issue until the end of the party...small "sun" "Although honest, sincere, and restrained, but very stubborn, very persistent people, "Moon" seems to be particularly concerned about the history of the blood family... "Justice" Audrey is doing the "reader" with great interest. "Daily sample observation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "dumping man" Al outstanding sound interrupted the discussion of "the sun" and "the moon":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know how the blood family should improve their strength. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlinton was distracted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amount, 'downside man 'Mr. What do you need to pay? I can exchange some lost history that the blood family has mastered. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"""" """"""" Members of the Tarot Club, such information exchange is free. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted man" is really a generous, noble person... Emlin made a preliminary judgment in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your kindness. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blood family can also take the potion promotion, but it must be the corresponding, the correct one. In the major churches, there are certain experiments. The results prove that this method is feasible, but the specific information, I can't see ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the main material of those potions is my family!" "Moon" Emlin denied this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“倒吊人” smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Never say absolute, for example, I have mastered the clues of the legacy of a bloody baron. He died in a sudden conflict, no time to find a successor, and you can use the potion to receive this legacy and not let the blood of the blood family lose." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a possession of a big pirate that Alger knows, because I don’t know what sequence of potions, and I’ve never been able to get rid of it. The craftsman channel is not very interested in this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inheritance of the legacy of the potion, not letting the blood of the blood family lose..." Emlin suddenly felt that "the man hanging down" made sense. So, he asked, "What price do you need to pay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Algerhehe smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Between 4,000 and 5,000 pounds, I have to wait until I find the owner to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not passed the big pirate trench But believe that the other party will accept as long as the price is not outrageous, because for pirates, if you sell it, you will not have much capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"5000 pounds?" "Moon" Emlin screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a large sum of money, I can move a few couples who have been watching for a long time, and can also have several sets for all dolls. new clothes! The first reaction of Emlin was to give up such a transaction. However, he thought of the favor of the ancestors, thought of the glory of the blood family, and thought of the identity of his own group of rescuers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger didn’t rush, laughing in an understatement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know this is a tough Decide, you can think slowly, don't worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Emlin was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted man" is really... "Justice" Audrey snorted in his heart and turned to "Moon" Emlin, to all Member: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms., gentlemen, is there a message from the fruit of the tree of the elders and the blood of the mirror dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Emlin answered without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before buying a special material for a big detective made him make a fortune, so every time he was a bloody party, he was very concerned about similar information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't wait for Miss Justice to ask questions, he said to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fruit price of the tree is between 600 and 700 pounds, and the blood of the mirror dragon is no more than 100 pounds. I don’t remember how much it is.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He truthfully Out of the original price marked by the seller, then add up: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you have to pay me 50 pounds, no, 100 pounds, you know, I have to take risks and waste time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the way Emlin learned from Sherlock Moriarty, he thinks it is very good Reasonable, because the intermediary also needs to pay! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The deal!" The voice of the other party just fell, Audrey happily chose to accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that this kind of thing can be counter-offer, but feels that it is not necessary, afraid to annoy the other party and let the transaction blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, the most important thing is the promotion sequence 7... Russell the Great said that the problem that can be solved with money is not a problem... Li’s recent feeling of sinking has improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, she received more than 20,000 pounds of jewels, horses, hounds, famous paintings, etc., most of them from the mother, two brothers and other members of the Hall family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for cash, not much, it is only 5,000 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution she made in the Bakerland smog incident, because she asked for concealment, did not receive any rewards, which all turned into Earl of Hall Political resources, for this reason, the big aristocratic banker said that after his own little angels have any expenses in the field of occultism, they can pay for their accounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Audrey is afraid to reveal that she wants to attack Sequence 7, and still can only use pocket money and private money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this month, you can return the last of the Glylint, and you will be able to pay the £2,000 of the "Foolish" Mr. ... Audrey thought in a good mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......very money... "Moon" Emlin almost failed to react, and then asked: <br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do I complete the transaction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey smiles and explains:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The way to sacrifice to Mr. Fool's."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the initiative to obtain the consent of the "fool", showing The corresponding ritual requirements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Emlin got the two pieces of parchment, he saw it one by one, and this trading method was beyond his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, he realized that Tarot would be different from the general secret organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the members’ transactions, Klein is very pleased, because as time goes by, Tarot will connect more and more channels and resources. The purpose of each of them is to be simpler than ever, and the requirements are no longer always raised, but no one responds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. "Justice" representing the psychological alchemy club, the Lun noble circle and the power of money, representing the storm church, the "downside man" of the sea resources, A small "sun" representing the land of God and the city of Silver, representing the "Magician" of the Abraham family and the Beckland part of the lower middle class, and the "moon" representing the blood family, let Tarot trade resources And the function of intelligence is getting better and better... They are also getting promoted... Klein is thinking, while manipulating the "world" hoarse voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I have a clue about the legacy of the 'psychologist', 'Miss Justice', do you still need it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just did not rush with Emlin Because he knows that "Justice" has raised a pet with the same route, and no one is afraid of the item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Audrey barely hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her thoughts are very simple. If an enemy attack is encountered, it may not be enough to provide an accident by himself alone, and it is more appropriate to add unexpected Susie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This takes a certain amount of time and may take a month or even two months." "World" is dumb and adds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem." Audrey has no psychological pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that Su Shi has not yet digested the "reader" potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, finalized the transaction, hope to let the "psychologist" get rid of it as soon as possible... "Justice" does not seem to ask what the price is, in her In my heart, there is a "fool" supervision, the price will not be too outrageous, and as long as it is not outrageous, she can accept? Her recent financial situation has improved a lot... Klein has made the "world" look "downside down" and whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Interested in Can you sell me an item?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The price is not less than 3,500 pounds, giving you 15%. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy cooperation. "After hanging down," Alger first agreed, and asked with interest, "What items?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
