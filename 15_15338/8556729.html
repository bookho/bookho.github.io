			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lobby of the "Plitz Port Ticketing Company" is quite spacious, with seven ticket windows, but each window has been arranged for ten or twenty personal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein glanced at the column, not directly to the relatively small number of columns, but to the right two steps to a straight erected piece of brown wood before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a continuous white paper on the board, and all the passenger information of the last week is announced, including the destination, the port, the price of different cabins, etc. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein also had a look at the future, and the staff came over and drew a red circle in the second-class position of one of the lines, marking a word: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sold out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very popular..." Klein whispered a sentence. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, Port Pritz is the kingdom's largest port, and countless people go here to the South Continent and those colonial islands to find opportunities." The middle-aged man next to the board responded with a slight exaggeration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wore a black bonnet and wore a black and white genre police uniform, but no epaulettes, only a seagull badge on the chest - this with the port of Pritz The ticket company's logo is exactly the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man’s face, his hands, and all the exposed skin are bronzed and rough, like the boiled sea breeze for many years. And the sun's exposure, so that the salt particles infiltrated the feeling of wrinkles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are disputes to find the guards in the hall... This should be the guard... Klein remembered the precautions at the door, did not mind the other party taking the initiative, smiled and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to know this port very well?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this question, the middle age The man replied quite smugly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I used to be a sailor of the Royal Navy. Their main base is on Oak Island in Port Pritz. I have served for 15 years. I spent a long time here at sea. If it wasn’t for the war of East Byron that destroyed my health, I could still be a sailor for 10 years! My understanding of this port is like the body of my wife. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little culture, and some vulgar... Klein has inquired about the news of the sea, and chats casually:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After retiring, are you here to be guarded?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I was stuffed into a The night school is full for two years, as a student, as a janitor, and the storm is on. Can you imagine the scenes of people of my age reading together with a group of teenagers? And they know and remember Words are faster than me!" The guards showed an expression that was unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he patted the outside of the thigh and sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately, every time I can't stand my knees in the cold and cold weather, otherwise I will work part-time as a night school teacher. Those kids will make you feel younger, but I don't deny that I am making more money when you have a When you have a wife and four children, you must realize that you have to support the family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr., you have a bit more... This is perhaps the ticketing company hires you. When the guards... Klein didn't pick up the other's topic, smiled and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just looked at the door and noticed that I was not allowed to open here. Canned squid, frankly speaking, I have never heard of this kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of the guard suddenly became complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pinched his nose:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was popular on the east coast of Fossac, The food in the Gargas and other places is salted wolffish, but it retains blood, smell, and the smell is very, very irritating, stinky and disgusting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;It turned out to be a dark dish... Kleinhaha laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I don’t think anyone would eat canned food when they line up to buy tickets. ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you don't understand that feeling. Maybe one day you can understand it." The guarded face looked scared. "There was a northern barbarian who came here to buy a ticket, but there were already many people in front, and the hall was stuffed. It was like a wooden bucket filled with fish. He was very anxious, so he opened the canned fish. In less than ten seconds, he and only a few guys remained in the entire hall."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, this is a chemical weapon... the normal version of the "biotoxin bottle"... Klein laughs: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the end I bought the ticket smoothly, and there are more new considerations outside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The result is not as he expected, the lady and husband responsible for ticket sales also escaped Go, huh, you know, the barbarian's brain is worse than the curler!" The guard smirked, "I am still a sailor. There was such a rumor at sea. A group of pirates controlled a ship from Rolls. Merchant ship, ah, that is a city on the east bank of Fossac. In short, those pirates urgently opened themselves up. The spoils, who knows that it is a wooden barrel filled with salted wolf fish, as a result, can you imagine the result? They fainted, vomited, lost their fighting power, and became the bounty of the crew."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good story." Kline refused to laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his eyes back on the paper on the board and looked for information on the vessel on January 5. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a professional, he pre-dubbed the date of the week that was suitable for sailing, one on the 5th, one on the 8th, and on the 5th to the Rothde Islands In the passenger ship, the most suitable for him is the St. Franc and the White Onyx. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still tickets, the price is similar, 4 pounds in the third class, 10 pounds in the second class, 35 pounds in the first class... people who depend on the sea for a living More or less will believe in the "master of the storm", even in the countries of Intis, Fossac, etc., there are fishermen and crew quietly believe in this unacceptable god to find the sea smoothly... St. Ful'an The name comes from the Holy One of the Storm Church, with a certain background... Klein thought about it and preferred to choose the White Onyx. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not in a hurry to decide to turn to the guard:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know the White Onyx The situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard suddenly smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr., your eyes are good The White Onyx is a steamship, but it retains sails and can reach a maximum speed of 16 knots.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the captain is experienced and used to be the King of the Navy, William V. The sailor is long, no, it should be the Royal Navy. The King has always claimed that he has won the title of Emperor of Bailang. Oh, in the Royal Navy, how good the ordinary people are, how good they are, and at most they can become sailors, not Serve as an officer, unless, unless you can satisfy your chief, no matter what way, any way! Only then can you be recommended to go to the Pritz Naval Academy and become a reserve officer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aerland was forced to leave the Navy, joined the White Onyx, and became the captain step by step.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suggest you choose the first class, so that you will have a room where you can sleep three to four servants, a waiter who has received a ceremonial course, a chef with a designated skill, and a quiet view. The restaurant has a special room for smoking cigars, and there are places where cards are played together..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the guards so detailed, Klein could not help but some doubts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noticing his expression, guarding and laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aerlan used to be my boss He often asks me to drink, let me help him sell first class, but you can rest assured that every word I say is true! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not really a problem, it is a question of money... Klein silently said a word.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He already had a decision, and asked and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., what advice do you have for a marine adventurer? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to qualify as Man. Sparo, Klein fine-tuned the image before, making himself appear more cold and sharp.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adventurer? "The guards unconsciously raised their voices.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
