			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey, who has already agreed with Hugh and Firth for an emergency contact, will soon pass the Golden Retriever Susie and will prompt Mr. As the information that I learned from another channel, I was transferred to two women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of an old church, Hugh’s thoughts on how to confirm the identity of Lalhous, how to create chaos, seize the opportunity to avenge Williams, The paper group was unfolded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......No need to confirm, is that Llanus? Hugh’s eyes were huge and he hurriedly swept through the rest of the content. I saw that the paper was clearly written: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can only be notified to the goddess of the night Church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remind them that Lalus has the deity of the 'real creator'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;""Divinity? 'The true creator' of the deity?" Hughed out, suddenly looked at the golden retriever dog responsible for sending the letter, found that the other side is also a face of the arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Folth listened and listened. Suddenly he felt that something was wrong. He took the paper and read it quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, she licked her lips, not knowing whether to laugh or to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... is this a joke?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do we blend in with the evil spirits about the deity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a swindler who is worth £200! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Forth's question, Su Shi can only use innocent eyes to express that I am just a dog, and I don't know what it means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falth did not expect a dog to answer his doubts. She said to her side:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Miss Audrey is probably not as innocent and simple as we think. She has a lot of secrets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This may be aristocrats and churches, "The game with the cult organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, it can be clearly seen that she did not know the divinity before, and she was also used. Um... the person who uses her may be her father, Count Earl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Fortunately, things stop here, you don't have to take risks anymore. After you have someone to report, you can receive a reward with peace of mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retired to talk:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Yes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hope, hope that the night can help Williams revenge, they are so strong, sure, yes..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, she suddenly turned to look to the side, as if talking to herself: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am still too weak." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too weak..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raining his hand and holding his mouth And nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still too weak...otherwise I will choose to avenge myself. But now I can only retreat to the next level... I don’t mention the “giants” and the hidden helpers around Llanus, but he’s got the “divine”, I shouldn’t be able to deal with it... just get the information. In the reaction speed of the night, it should be done tonight. The Beckland Parish is second only to the headquarters of the church. There are many seals, there are many strong people, and there is no need to wait for extra helpers... Klein returned to the real world, put a little beard, changed his hair, and stayed in the mirror for a few minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has some expectations, some excitement, and some embarrassment and powerlessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the evening, he left the Craig Club and returned to Minsk Street. He went to the grocery market on the way and was free to find a very busy and busy stall. I bought a few masks that included a clown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to go to the side to watch the action of rounding up Llanus tonight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to see the other person pay for the previous madness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, with his strength, he can only look far and far, and he has no right to approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until 11 o'clock, and when many people have entered the dream, Klein puts on a gray-blue worker's uniform and disguised as he did last night, then he puts on Cap, go a few blocks away, take a rental carriage and head to the Beckland Bridge area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got there, he changed to walk and arrived at the East Byron Dock all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s interview questions yesterday included “Where do you live now”, “How is the surrounding environment?”, so he is very clear about Langu The night will be in the dormitory provided by the Dock Workers Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Klein did not get close there, cautiously circumvented, targeting the clock tower of the East Byron Dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——In Beckland, in addition to large churches with towering iconic clock towers, many government buildings will be supplemented with one, not necessarily too high, no It must be magnificent, not necessarily gorgeous, and practical, such as the East Byron Dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the surrounding three-story building, it is like a giant, towering into the night, overlooking this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein easily flipped inside the clock tower and walked up the stairs in the end of the circle, flying fast in the dark. Finally, he came to his destination and came over the huge wall clock, surrounded by a deep yellow fence with a pointed top that he could reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upper steps, Klein hides in the shadows, distinguishes the position, and looks to the dock union's dormitory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a brick-and-red two-story building, and the pedestrians who pass by occasionally are close to black spots in Kline’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gazed for a few seconds, stepped back and became more involved in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he took out the newly bought mask and put it on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a clown with a high-pitched mouth and a reddish-colored nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy clown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is wearing a clown mask like this, standing in the darkness of the dark I waited patiently for the scheduled play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is two hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pointer of the large wall clock below crossed the point, he suddenly saw the same thing flying in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a huge airship with a dark black finish! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not a meager moonlight, it’s hard to separate from the night, it’s not like an exaggerated mechanical roar as described in newspapers and magazines. Its blades are quietly rotating, and the whole is as quiet as a vulture that has found prey but has not found a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sturdy and lightweight alloy propped up the skeleton of the cotton cloth, and the box with the organic muzzle, the throwing mouth and the muzzle hanging from below, was full of deterrence at first glance force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sound... Is this a temporary treatment with extraordinary means? Klein, wearing a clown mask, looked at the slow-moving airship and had some guesses in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, his biggest misunderstanding is that small-scale extraordinary battles in densely populated areas of the city have sent airships! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not afraid of accidentally injuring people around you? Not afraid of causing panic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the airship was suspended in the air for about 10 meters, so that Klein would not even have to worry about being discovered, his position. A lot higher than this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Observing the situation below, he suddenly had a guess, that is, most of the airships will not be put into combat, but the scene will be monitored by air. Provide a better perspective for the action personnel, guard against accidents and possible escapes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there were three black windbreakers in front of the two-story brick red building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first person did not wear a hat, had a short shaved golden brown hair, and the dark green eyes were as deep as a lake without wind and no light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neckline of his shirt and trench coat is high and vertical, and the palms are covered with a pair of bright red bloody gloves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a suitcase made of silver metal is wrapped around his left hand through a chain of the same color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the nine senior deacons of the Night Goddess Church, one of the nine senior deacons, and he is also the "red glove" team. One of the Big Three, this time is exactly in Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sésima looked at the front and turned his head to the left hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Seal '1—63'.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, Lord Sesima.” The night singer squatted down and helped Sesima unravel the entanglement. Silver white suitcase chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole process, Crestel Sesima's muscles are very tight and seem to be fighting against something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of the left side of the night silently took a breath, slammed down, let the surface of the silver box have an illusory ripple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light around it disappeared, it seems that all of them were sucked into the box. The bone sword of less than one meter exudes a moist, pure white light, slowly floating. It’s up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its blade is holding a quaint silver-plated mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image reflected in the mirror, layer after layer, constantly superimposed, no end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of the left side picks up the mirror and aligns it to the brick red building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small building is clearly reflected in it, and everything seems to have not changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sésima slowly vomited, extended his left hand and held the bone sword less than a metre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding lighting is restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go in." He stepped closer and approached the entrance to the brick red building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three nights open the door and enter the gloomy house, pointing to the stairs leading to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a tall but thin figure emerged in the shadow of the corner, wearing a black priest’s suit with pale yellow wavy hair and Beast-like dark brown eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the sword of the goddess?" The "giant" approaching two meters is a low opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, his right palm suddenly clenched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade unionists in this brick red building blasted one by one in their sleep, and they didn’t even have time to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their bodies are torn apart, turned into thick, thick flesh and blood, half of which rushes to the "giant", to be woven into a cloak that resists spells and reduces damage. The huge carpet of hair covers the three nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creste. Sesima just looked quietly and did nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the flesh and blood dissipated, collapsed, fell like rain, but did not stain the red floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in each room, a group of people reappeared, still asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the world in the mirror, only for the extraordinary world of the mirror, the bloody bombs that you presuppose in the bodies of ordinary people are illusory here. "Sésima gave the sacred bones to his right hand and raised it. There was no light everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" "Giant" suddenly grabbed his left shoulder with his right palm, violently tore the entire arm, and then smashed his bones to the positive In front! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
