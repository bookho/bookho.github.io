			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; East Chester County, Hall family estate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey sat in front of the dressing table and lit a candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, she looked at herself in the mirror through the slight gleam of fire, the tourmaline gradually deepened, people could not move their eyes, it seems that even the soul wants Indulge in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Audrey, stay awake in the dream tonight." She said softly to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a simple "psychological suggestion." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old song that I heard at dusk gave her inspiration and raised the idea of ​​exploring my dreams to see if I could enter the subconscious sea of ​​all living beings. Spiritual sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an attempt that other "psychologists" never thought of, at least there is no similar thing in the reference experience provided by the "Psychological Alchemy" - suggesting yourself Explore your own dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you can find the soul dragon, even the "Miracle City" Levished's trace... Audrey regained his gaze and took it down into a ruby The "lie" of the necklace is placed in a jewelry box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is afraid that this magical item that can amplify the emotions affects herself in the dream, causing unnecessary harm, so she carefully handles it in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Audrey subconsciously looked at herself in the glasses and found that there was a little flaw in her appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When wearing "lie", she felt that her beauty made her addicted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wake up, Audrey, that's just a lie!" She lifted her right palm and stroked her cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, she was extraordinarily glad that she had taken the name "lie" for the magical item, and she will always be alert, otherwise one day she will totally rely on it. , refuse to face the true self, once lost, it is likely to lose control directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those girls who are more ordinary, wear 'lie', modify their looks, get near-perfect changes, maybe never again Willing to take off, prefer to die, but also to keep... This corresponds to the 'extraordinary', and can't have a similar mentality..." Audrey sighed and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wears a slippery silk robe, walks lightly and expects to walk in a warm, spring-like room, back to a soft, flexible bed. And pulled a rope from the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The close-fitting maid Anne opened the door and gently extinguished the lights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn’t take long, Audrey really slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fascinating world, she suddenly made a shock and realized that she was dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked around with great interest and silently said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is The 'lucid dream' in psychology?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In occultism, there are similar concepts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really effective, I rely on the simple self 'psychological suggestion', successfully made a 'lucid dream', Audrey, you are a genius~ No, No, no, this is mainly the application of extraordinary ability, can not be proud."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Audrey has figured out what the current dream is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is walking on a gloomy road, surrounded by dark forests, with towering towers in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The groaning and elongating wolf screams, the slow and screaming, the screams of screams, from all directions, create a dangerous and oppressive atmosphere. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was still scared by the assassination of the Duke of Ingen, fearing that one day, many extraordinary people came to attack Dad, mother and brother... Audrey I analyzed my dream from the perspective of “psychologist”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking and walking, a figure suddenly appeared in the Black Forest. It was a dragon covered with golden scales, with pale gold eyes and a thick tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon's facial features are exactly the same as Audrey, with its body, a kind of awkward and awkward feelings that are difficult to describe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ao Lili was shocked and almost woke up from her dreams. Fortunately, she had done the "audience" and she stabilized her mood in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made her understand that she never really forgot to take the "psychologist" potion when it was almost out of control. At that time, self-comforting self-motivation and feelings improved only On the surface, the shadows have been rooted in the depths of the subconscious, and from time to time will be reflected in the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately found today, and then can try to subconsciously treat, I am a "psychologist"! If you have been ignoring this problem, when you advance to the sequence of 6, you may be afraid of it and get out of control... Audrey seriously examined it himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stop and stop, Audrey’s dreams are not constantly changing, and in a story, this is unqualified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, she walked over to the castle and saw a magic wand with an arm length sweeping through the air, sprinkling a little bit like a starlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle that was shrouded in light became magnificent, and all the darkness and gloom disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melody of the band played, and the gas wall lamp was lit up again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my first and most beautiful expectation for extraordinary power... It’s a fantasy of a little girl..." Audrey’s mouth curled up and she changed her mood. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't stop, crossed the castle, and walked to the edge of this dream, no matter how the scene changed behind, how the story unfolded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, she walked through the deserted wilderness and came over the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out, the grayness is not spreading, the depth below is as deep as if there is no bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey is soberly aware that this is the boundary of her dreams. Once I leave, I don’t know what will happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And how do you leave? Jumping? Will it fall to death..." Audrey thought hard, not too risky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a few tens of seconds, she slowly got an idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dream, It originates from the spiritual world. As the master, I can open a path for myself with my will! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the thought of trying, she is trying to show what she is thinking like on the fog. The only difference is that the former needs to use the "fool" "Mr.'s strength, and now she has to rely on herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey stretched out his right hand and spread it down, aiming at the gray abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of her, the gray suddenly surged, revealing a layer of layers that spread down but could not see the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey slowly took a breath, slightly lifted the skirt, took the step and stepped on the first step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stepped down, and it was getting quieter and quieter, making it easy to hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to gray, gray, and can not see anything, lonely and unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistling whirlwinds are changing in the direction of the moment, letting Audrey shake the body and the fear is slowly deepening. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grab the emotions before they get out of control, her green eyes flow out of the deep but warm light, seems to be able to see through the hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey appease himself with the ability of "psychoanalysis"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She continued to explore, after a few tens of seconds, a gray spot suddenly appeared in the surrounding gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...this is my subconscious mind, is this the shadow of mine?" Audrey vaguely understood where he had gone deep after leaving the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not in a hurry to resolve this shadow, and continues to step by step with full expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the theory of the "Psychological Alchemy", the bottom of the subconscious is her destination - the collective subconscious sea of ​​all creatures! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of the downswing, Audrey saw herself as a child who listened to her father’s story and told her that she valued the image but she was not so elegant. I saw myself participating in the Tarot Club, but the light spots like the latter were all wrapped in gray fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I am subconsciously...affecting my character and behavior? Audrey instinct is analyzed with psychological knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different light spots flashing, she repeatedly explored the edge of emotional collapse due to this long-lost goal of loneliness, but all of them timely "settled" with extraordinary ability Yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she lost her feelings about the passage of time, she saw the last step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of the steps is a solid, fuzzy, gray "ground", swaying above the road, they are dense, they overlap, just like the illusory sea . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collective subconscious ocean... Audrey took a few steps forward and looked up, accidentally discovering that "grey" no longer obscures his own vision, clearly presented at high altitude Come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless figures that are difficult to describe, with seven different colors, and a clear and radiant brilliance with endless knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey licked his lower lip and rejoiced: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spiritual sky. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, she walked cautiously and started her own adventure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light and shadow that make up the sea pass from time to time in front of her eyes, some contain ancient memories burned by flames, and some carry direct sights of unspeakable things. The ultimate pain encountered...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the imprint of the ancestors from ancient times, Audrey also saw a line of hope and admiration for herself, and saw it. Worship the folk activities of the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking along, she found a gray-white mountain in the distance to the left. It stretched all the way up and drilled the ocean of light and shadow. Clear and confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that another person's consciousness? In the "ocean" is the subconscious mind, is it normal consciousness beyond the sea? Hey, he is dreaming... Audrey suddenly thought of a possible "psychologist" application skill, that is, to get close to the past, climb up, directly affect the other side's subconscious mind, let him naturally act according to their own arrangements. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it should be difficult and very dangerous... Audrey regained her sight and did not rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clearly remembers that this time she came to find the soul dragon and the "miracle city" Levished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey passed the tens of hundreds of other people’s consciousness, and gradually felt exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's time to go back." She instinctively looked up and looked into the distance, rationally making a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood there for a long time and didn't want to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Audrey is about to turn around, there is a shadow in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That are two huge, gray wings! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the wings, there is a lizard-like monster with a long body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is covered with gray scales of large scales, with four thick and powerful legs, which seem to bathe in the sun that does not exist, shining like the setting sun Rays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
