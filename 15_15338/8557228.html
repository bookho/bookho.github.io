			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving Black Point Street 47, Klein has figured out the basics of Winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his changing looks, disguised as a policeman, and heard from a nearby neighbor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Symim Island, the farthest island of the Rothschild Islands, from Beyam, it takes 4 to 5 hours to take a passenger liner, and the passenger liner is daily There are only two classes, at 9 am and 10 am, which have been missed today... Winter’s parents have already died, and there are no relatives. The only person involved is a girl who he can’t forget, and it’s the first time that it’s really good. Object, suitable for me, this newbie, but want to whisper for Winter, or from the heart of the cockroach... If the girl promised... I will go, how should it end..." Klein looked embarrassed With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to recall the novels he had read and the movies and TV shows he had seen, hoping to get the most perfect solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he had a general idea, his mood stabilized, and his thoughts began to shift to the "steel" Maviti. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that Miss ‘Magician’ will get the radio ticker as soon as possible...” Klein sighed silently and boarded a rental carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Jowood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;False opened the letter that Hugh came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comes from the science fiction novelist Avelle. The other party is very happy to share the development history and application prospects of radio technology with Ms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falth directly skipped the beginning and the middle of the content, his eyes swept to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Introduced 3 models, with detailed address and approximate price, the most expensive is only 12 pounds." Fols nodded gently, I think this is not What is too important business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly felt that she was somewhat inflated, perhaps in the Tarot meeting, used to trade hundreds of pounds and thousands of pounds, and about 10 pounds of items were not put In the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. "World" has resources and financial resources. Maybe he will buy items from him in the future, and he will not need anything. Well, add a stamp to the original price. Fees, round-trip carriage fees, ritual material loss fees will be fine... Forsy quickly made up his mind and looked down the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland is still in a dark, dimly lit state, but the fog is not as strong as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know when the sacred stomach bag of the ‘Sun’ will arrive...” Fols felt that he couldn’t wait to be promoted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of Silver, Berg Home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick is ready to eat the food bag and the materials specified by Mr. "Down Man", but is not in a hurry to offer to Mr. Fool Festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He plans to wait a second time and wait until the "chief" leader explores the team to go out or host some ceremonies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the safest and safest... um, cautious, be careful!" Dairik reminded himself, and immediately opened the "Wang Wangting Black Rock" in front of him. Book of Handbooks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent past, he has been reading this ancient book, and he has seen the little face of the giant Wang Ting in the old age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the ancient books, that is the king of God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time there seems to be solidified, always at dusk, all the buildings are extremely magnificent, extremely spectacular, even towering into the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human being walks inside, it is extremely small, and it will come from the heart to fear such scenes and the masters of the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Hilston, Wimandi . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the explanation, Emlin White used his hand to comb and took care of his hair. He deliberately asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Baron, I forgot where I heard it. In the second century or the first half of the Third Age, there is a well-known city-state called 'Baiyin City'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weimandi is a vampire baron, age It is over 200 years old, but the appearance is not old at all, but it is like a mature man who is just in his early thirties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brunette is neatly combed, wearing a dark red cotton shirt, holding a brown pipe in his hand, enjoying the warmth of the fireplace, thinking about it Said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, at least in my memory, there is no silver city before the Cataclysm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unable to wait for Emlin to be happy, he said to himself: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there is a country of silver that was originally ruled by the giant Wang Ting. Later belonged to that person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country of silver? Emlin White thought for a moment: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Barons, is there a more specific situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Mandi looked up at him and smiled and recalled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The country of silver has a special status in the giant Wang Ting, they have no Directly believe in the giant king Ormill, the object of faith is the queen of the giant Wang Ting, Omega. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The City of Generosity" Byam, Docklands, Sour Lemon Street, "Azure Wind" Hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stands on the corner of the street, uncovering the citrine pendant on the left wrist and using divination to confirm that there is no danger ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of his heart slowly walked back to the hotel, up to the third floor, opened the door of the luxury suite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was slightly surprised that the "flame" Daniz had returned and was drinking in the easy chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the next person’s tone, Klein calmly asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doesn't there be a wall clock?" Daniz groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the opposite wall and read the current time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"3 pm 40 Points..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is not falling, Daniz suddenly wakes up, sits up straight, laughs two channels:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have inquired about the place I asked. I also asked the person who asked me, there is no need to stay outside, it will increase the risk of exposure and affect your hunting plan!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein found a chair and sat down with a blank expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take the story again."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What can be the problem? Although I am mainly an adventurer chasing treasures, but also a qualified part-time pirate." Daniz felt that his ability was insulted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being glanced at by Gilman Sparo, he smiled again, where did he go in the morning and afternoon, what happened? People, I heard what news, and talked about something. I briefly reviewed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard Daniz feels that a ghost ship pirate captain named Alger knows the things in Banxi, and Klein suddenly wants to frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the relationship between Mr. "Down Man" and the Church of the Storm, before I took the initiative to mention the "World", he was not aware of the changes in Banxi Port. Where can this Alger know? The storm church has a higher status inside, disguised as a pirate powerhouse, or a guy with a certain relationship with the cultists in Banxi? Um... "The man hanging up" has been active in this area of ​​the sea, and it is not possible to rule out it... Klein’s heart is moving, recalling the characteristics of the "downside down man". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the fog, although he can't see the specific appearance of the members, but the man is a woman, how the hair color is, it is clear at a glance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein raised his hand and pressed down the words of Daniz’s follow-up, and he whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The hair is very messy, dark blue?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know him? This guy is not simple!" Deniz exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough... Oh, I didn’t expect it to happen... Klein didn’t respond, just lean forward and lean forward:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz didn't think too much, and described the experience afterwards, self-justification :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, inquire about the news, no one can be sure when there will be gains. After you have found all the people you can find, the only thing you can do. The thing is to wait patiently, which necessarily requires a certain, not short time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are other ways, do not need to wait." Klein deliberately flat Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Daniz slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pushed the gold-rimmed glasses, and the corners of the mouth opened slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Bait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bait? Daniz looked at each other and was a bit puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a second of work, he’s already awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that can be a bait is himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fishing, no one cares if the bait will really be swallowed, only care if you can bring the prey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, "bait" is a high-risk species! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, this is not a very good way, um, my instincts tell me that the 'Red Theatre' side should be a bit of a harvest, I am now Take a look at the past!” Daniz took the coat and couldn’t wait to rush out of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein wanted to hang himself behind the "flame" to see if he could find some clues. As a result, the layers of illusory prayers sounded loudly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comes from a man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein paused thoughtfully and turned into the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten seconds, he appeared on the fog, and the dark red star corresponding to the "downside down" was expanding and contracting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough... Klein sat down and leaned against the back of the chair to spread the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of "downside down" becomes clear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected 'fool' Sir, I am going to trace the 'Iceberg Lieutenant' that key, and met the 'flame' Daniz in the Gold Coin Casino. He knows from his mouth that he is the party of Banxi Port and intends to join forces with a strong man. , against 'Steel' Maviti.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suspect that the 'flame' Daniz cooperation is your leader, so pray to you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is, and he wants to get some cooperation, I can provide some help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mr.&nbsp;“倒吊人” did guess Gull Spalo’s identity... He should have only a little doubt, and he was successfully confirmed from Daniz’s mouth by asking about Banxi’s affairs... This is also good, with the help of his local snake, the plan to hunt "steel" Maviti will be much smoother... unless it can directly hit the "fool", then the "downside down" potter has no meaning... From his performance and attitude, he still has no doubts about the "fool"... I have not left any loopholes... Klein thoughts turned and quickly made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After divination, he has a "world", letting this dummy cover the fog, making a prayer posture, and responding in a calm manner:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
