			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small town on the outskirts of Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, put on dry and clean clothing, placed the soaked banknotes on the surface of the table, waiting for them to dry naturally in a warm room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, he moved cautiously, very softly, and even the sneezing and cough caused by a cold fever were forcibly suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that there were no mistakes, he did not control himself to bake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, he walked to the corner of the hotel room, where there was a full-length mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Klein black hair in the mirror is neatly combed, with a pair of dark brown eyelids, and the face is quite thin and angular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a golden-rimmed eye on his nose, no beard on his lips, and looks young and unremarkable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the appearance of Zhou Mingrui who changed his character according to the characteristics of the northern continent, and he is a university student who will be vigorous and not fattened by society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intends to wait for things to calm down, then go back to Bakerland and make a legal identity for the current appearance - with leaving Tingen That would be compared to the fact that he does not lack the corresponding channels, such as Ian in the "Brave" bar, such as Miss Sharon's circle, such as Essinger Stanton's detective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really missed... Klein whispered a busy ceremony in the room where the curtains had already been drawn, ready to bring "squirming hunger" into the fog Do a foolproof study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancient palace where there is no one, he appears at the top of the bronze long table, holding a thin glove made of human skin, leaning back on the chair Back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he closed his eyes and extended the spirituality into the item that needed to be sealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately felt the hunger of the glove, it seemed to have a stomach bag that could never be filled, but it was so gentle on the fog, even A trace of malice does not dare to flow out, as if there is a hound there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Klein heard the unwilling shouts and painful embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A twisted, sly, mournful transparent face is immediately highlighted in his inspiration, filled with sorrow and madness that people can't bear to witness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These "faces" are deeply integrated with the extraordinary characteristics of different colors and different states. Wherever Klein's spirituality spreads, it can be correspondingly The face is combined to use the capabilities it has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how it is used? Klein tried again and again, and combined with divination, roughly figured out which five souls are currently "grazing". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is "no face", but only the ability to change the look and body;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 It is a "psychologist". He can get the target into a frenzied state, can make certain psychological hints, can simulate Longwei, shock individuals and groups, and create confusion;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The third is the “interrogator” who can make the wearer of the glove proficient in the use of various weapons, become a blasting expert, and have the ability to condense the spirit and puncture the target spirit;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth is "nightmare", there is only one ability, that is, silently dragging people into dreams, but unlike the corresponding extraordinary, this mainly relies on "squirming hunger" to complete, so the wearer enters the nightmare state , you can still move your body;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five is the "Priest of Light", which produces a halo-like effect, purifying a range of necrotic and filthy creatures At the same time, he also has a "singer" to enhance the voice of himself and his companions, can summon than "yang "Weaker" sacred light. " <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limit is five souls, and the ability to use it when it is first "grazing"... This is not something that you can decide, pure luck, maybe three Maybe there is only one... Klein nodded thoughtfully, sighed, and said to those suffering souls:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the soul that I graze in the future will only come from people who are sinful and unforgivable. Every time I kill such an extraordinary person, I will let one of you be replaced and get liberated, no matter whether his ability is needed by me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His solemn but soft voice echoed in the ancient palace, and the painful souls of mourning were quiet, not so distorted and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein breathed a sigh of relief, opened his eyes and tapped the edge of the ancient long table with his fingers, silently saying:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ability of that 'no face" overlaps with me and has no value at all. When there is a replacement, he is the first to release him. Well, when you can, try to psychic. Talk to him, maybe get the news of the high sequence of the 'Divination' route, and the clues of where the mermaid is.... No, don't wait for a replacement, after a few days, the cold is healed, the state is restored, you can try... Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The soul of the 'Light Priest' should be able to complement the formula I obtained before, and he will leave the corresponding extraordinary characteristics, so that The little 'sun' doesn't have to worry about the follow-up promotion. Well, he will be the second one to get rid of..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for every use, it is necessary With a human soul and flesh and blood to feed the 'creeping hunger' thing, I don’t need to care, I am definitely not Use it, when you need it, you must face the terrible enemy. In such a battle, there is definitely no shortage of life that can be harvested. Even if it is not, I can throw the 'squirming hunger' on the fog, don't worry about it. Anti-phasing, it will not hurt the innocent, the worst result is that it can no longer be used..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting thoughts, Klein tried to use "squirming The hunger" this magical item divination "Shepherd" potion formula, but in the end only harvested the results of the failure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no divination source of "sweet hunger" Worried about the bad existence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are fog partitions and blocking, he is not afraid to endanger himself, but then, "squirming hunger" may Will be damaged.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you no longer need it, consider making a corresponding attempt... Klein leans forward and supports the elbow on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly recalled the previous things, keenly paying attention A detail:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the omnipotent key was annihilated, the extraordinary characteristics did not disappear, but became light particles, trying to aggregate...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is foreseeable that the resulting 'apprentice' character will no longer be based on Mr. Men’s cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, in this way, mental pollution within extraordinary characteristics can be removed!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But the problem is that under normal circumstances, there is no way to destroy the extraordinary characteristics of solidification. At that time, it relied on a ritual that allowed the gods to come. The fronts needed include a large number of innocent lives...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, once the 'Eye of All Black' is smashed, the hidden "real creator" spiritual pollution will inevitably erupt, and who can bear it in the fog? Do you do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thoughts, Klein remembered the possible encounters in the Eastern District, and he was busy with paper and pen and doing the corresponding divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the revelation, he lost his expression and slowly and slowly leaned back against the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his, the innocent fog is still silent and ups and downs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey stood by the window and looked at the yellow and iron The black staggered mist quickly dissipated, watching the heavy rain that did not belong to the winter, and the mood was stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, she and Susie finally waited for Count Earl to go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dad, how are you?" Audrey asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resolved, but the specific process is still unclear, my little princess, you really helped a lot this time, you deserve a ton of medal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like this, it’s good... Thanks to Mr. Fool’s reminder, thanks to his leader’s adventure investigation... Our Tarot will once again stop the evil spirits from coming, and once again save the world! Audrey’s heart is full of pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Hall took the towel from the maid’s hand and wiped his face and sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But this time it still caused more serious casualties. The smog of Beckland could become so deadly... Although the statistics have not yet come out, I estimate that there are more than 10,000 people in the Eastern District, the Docklands and the factory area. Death, and the plague is still spreading, you have tried not to go out recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 10,000? This is a figure that Audrey can understand but can't imagine. Only when she celebrates the country every day, when she floats, she can see thousands of people gather together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this does not prevent her from feeling heavy and her mood is low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wuxi stood outside the apartment and looked at wearing a white coat and wearing Doctors and nurses in large masks entered inside and carried out a body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She already knew the result, her expression was numb, her eyes were empty, and she was subconsciously approaching the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the police responsible for the cordon stopped her:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't go, you want Infected with the plague?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The West stopped there, watching the two bodies being carried out, watching Mom Lifu hold her sister Frya tightly They watched them being carried to the delivery carriages around the black cloth, temporarily requisitioned, and they disappeared in front of their eyes when they were covered with white cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage slowly travels towards the other side of the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Daisy seemed to wake up from her dreams. She turned her body and ran fast, chasing the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground after the rain was unusually muddy. She fell several times and climbed several times, making her body smudged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, she still couldn’t catch up with the carriage and watched it disappear into the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yixi slowed down, his body swayed slightly, his expression was very sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She held the trees by the street and stared at the place where the carriage left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, her whole person softened, and a cry came out of her throat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Freia..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is thin and low Low, sharp and weak, and endless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, in the Eastern District, in the dock area, in the factory area, there are tens of thousands of people who also mourn And crying.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queens, Sodrak Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wearing a crown, a strong face, George III with two mustaches sitting on the throne, looking at the Earl of the Palace in front of him, for a long time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, the people of the three churches are waiting outside for your explanation. Asked the Earl of the Palace to sweat in the forehead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Interpretation? Prince Edsac is tempted by the witch, colluding with the cult, trying to rebel, this is the explanation! His conspiracy has been revealed, he has already made his own decisions, and they have to explain! "George III suddenly became angry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
