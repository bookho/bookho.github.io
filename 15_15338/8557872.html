			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary party? When Klein thought about it, he nodded and responded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Master "The collection of auxiliary materials for the potion medicine should also be put on the agenda. You can also see if you can meet the craftsman... He subconsciously plans the arrangement in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Greman. Sparo promised, Daniz quietly breathed a sigh of relief, and it was difficult to contain the smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few days, the bounty has improved a lot and he has not been out of the heavy duty of monitoring. He has been very honestly staying in the hotel suite, and he is very depressed and can’t wait. It will come soon at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary people mentioned by Daniz meet in the Fragrant Leaf Bar, where many pirates, informants and adventurers are active, and they are the first to inquire about intelligence and purchase supplies. A file selection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is wearing a black coat and a silk top hat, following Daniz through the crowded heads of the mixed bar hall, into a card room, at several guards Under the gaze, the agreed secret number is given, along the hidden ladder all the way down to the wide underground area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same as the “Dragon Bar” in Tingen, which has an underground trading market selling herbs, essential oils, ancient books, spells and various common occult materials. But the difference is that there are a variety of guns and ammunition for sale here, and Klein even found fire and lead bombs belonging to antiques. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, there are fake identity documents, and the seals are ... overseas colonies, similar industries are more developed than Tingen... Buying a batch of materials to be used as a spell in the field of "Poseidon", there will always be some concessions in large quantities... Klein rotates his head to a small extent and takes all the conditions in the underground area to the bottom of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniel next to him has doubts about his makeup and dressing technique, deliberately wearing a top hat, pressing the front down very low, covering the small half Zhang face, at this time, he is very skilled to lead Klein straight to the other end of the underground trading market, with a two-and-four-short percussion to open the closed door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one candle behind the door. It sways on the side wall of the lamp holder, and it is dimly lit, barely illuminating the small room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz pointed or hanged or placed on the table in a robe mask, etc., to Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is up to you to decide what to do with camouflage, or you can't do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked around and looked over the guards in the room. We:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now the lineman of the Kingdom Army, The Storm Church knows this identity too, there is nothing to be afraid of... If the pirates and adventurers have made a slap in the face because I have not done camouflage, I am trying to attack, oh... Klein’s mind is fascinating with a bounty. A scene that flies to yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz snorted and licked his mouth, picked up the black iron mask and put it on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he and Klein, led by the guards, entered another room through a dim corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout is quite luxurious, the floor is covered with thick carpets from the South Continent, and the walls are decorated with glittering lanterns and fresh candles. There is a heavy ray of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s eyes swept away, without Daniz’s help, he found a brown leather sofa and sat down, leaning back and picking up his right leg. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been more than twenty people gathered here, there are men, women, covered with hooded robes, and they have a natural appearance, according to Dani The descriptions made in the morning, not all of them are extraordinary, and there are spokesmen of certain forces and adventurers, pirates, and occult enthusiasts who want to be extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a quiet atmosphere, time flies quite slowly. After about seven or eight minutes, the old man sitting in the easy chair straightens his back and hands over, laughing道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of his age, his white hair is already sparse, leaving only a thin layer, but the light brown eyes are not cloudy, bright and sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The convenor of the party, 'Gi Lishi' Ozil, formerly known pirate, now the owner of the Fragrant Leaf Bar behind the scenes." Daniz micro-body The low voice said to Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He actually said it in the morning, but he was afraid that German Sparo could not be on the top and angered himself afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret being mastered is really a sad thing... Daniz sighed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein can't see the dagger, quietly watching other people's transactions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some potions recipes such as "warrior", "sailor" and "sneak peek", but no one has ever purchased it. The sellers who are looking forward to it are disappointed to stop again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz took a look at the face of German. Sparo, with no expression on his face, sideways, whispered:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no notary at this gathering, there is no strong fortuneteller, the authenticity of the potion formula cannot be guaranteed, this kind of thing is too easy to fake, and even if the formula is recognized as fake, Can't punish the seller, because he may also be the victim."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know...this is one of the reasons why the potion recipe can't be widely spread...Kline put down The right leg is lifted, leaning forward slightly, and the voice is not high and the voice is open:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need the spirituality of the ancient resentment."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not mention the six-winged gargoyle's eyes, the spring water of the Sunia Golden Spring and other auxiliary materials, worried that others would guess that he is a "no face" and is preparing for promotion. "Master of Secrets." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-In the city of Tingen, Klein relied on the matching of auxiliary materials to doubt that Dust Guderian was a quasi-"audience". Thereby clarifying the identity of his members of the psychological alchemy club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residual spirituality of the individual ancient grievances cannot be inferred more, as many rituals in the field of the dead are used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Klein did not disguise, he should be cautious, he still has it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was quiet for two seconds, a slightly dull humming sound:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Needs How much?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really? Klein controlled his expression and did not let the joy reveal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked sideways at the person who spoke and found a 30-year-old man with obvious local ancestry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person's skin color bronze, but there is a kind of long-term malnutrition or lack of light, the face is thin, the cheekbone is protruding, the eyes are sunken, white is more than black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A small vial." Klein pulled out a metal vial as an example. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin, dull man was silent for a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"500 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s reasonable... Klein wanted to counter-offer, but the corner of his eye was aimed at Daniz sitting next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Greel Sparo, a cold and crazy adventurer... Klein repeated this sentence three times in his heart, quietly sucking With a sigh of relief, he nodded calmly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the pre-prepared Stacked thick cash, points out of 500 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white-eyed man took a glass test tube from his pocket and threw it at his hand and threw it at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For more than a year, spirituality will be completely lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein lifted his right hand and took the glass test tube accurately. He saw a phosphorescent light spot floating inside, and when they touched the inner wall of the glass, they would swell and become a vaguely blurred face. Open your mouth, silently shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true... Klein nodded secretly and handed a thick 500 pounds of cash to the waiter who came close, and he transferred it to the seller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transaction continues, most of the abortions, a small amount of success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearing the end, the party convener, "Gi Lishi" Ozer smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I have a commission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said while taking a photo from the inside pocket of the garment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Find the person above, the reward is 1000 pounds, or the common extraordinary material of the equivalent, remember, can not hurt her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1000 pounds? This can make most adventurers crazy... I don't know who I am looking for, I have given such a high reward... Klein did not accidentally see everyone present and expressed willingness to give it a try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The photos began to pass in a counterclockwise order and arrived in Klein's hand in a few minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at him at random, and suddenly there was a little surprise in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman on the photo looks quite beautiful, with a bright red hair and a pair of green eyes like gems, the skin color is not white, but gives a healthy feeling . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When taking a photo, she was dressed in a long skirt of lake color, and the waist was tightened with a ribbon of flowers, which looked very slender and looked like Laughing, but the whole is not pleasant, it is awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good-looking girl... Who will spend 1000 pounds to find her, and the premise is that she can’t hurt her... um, a photo that barely smiles... In the mind of Ryan, there was a lot of romance stories filled with love and hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What overbearing pirates fell in love with the daughter of a wealthy businessman, robbed her to her own boat, and finally escaped by her, what a broken aristocratic lady became a pirate, lost her hand, With the "Calculator" and the military middle and upper class men staged a sinful love, and used this to get out of the predicament, left the cage, what the freshly baked witch is inviting people, accidentally provoked feelings Debt... A similar idea surged, and Klein almost lifted his hand and covered his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last generation of novels has seen more... In this world, there is a magical shadow... He sighs and raises his head, to the party convener Oz尔道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is her name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ilian." Ozl Concisely replied, "But it must have been replaced with a pseudonym."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilan, the typical Intis female name... Klein asks again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have items that she wears often?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hair is OK. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the medium used for divination.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not mention the recent through The clothes that have not been washed are also in compliance with the requirements. I am afraid that the employer behind the scenes will throw a woman's underwear, which is quite embarrassing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ozl shook his head: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She has strong anti-tracking ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is her strength?" Another party participant asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ozl solemnly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The employer did not describe it in detail, but said that it was not too powerful. , but stronger than the sequence 9.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
