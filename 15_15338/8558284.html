			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has a pen and paper, and writes a divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The radio ticker is dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Checked twice carefully, he took off the spirit in the left wrist cuff and began to divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, he is highly alert and somewhat fearful, like a child who ignites firecrackers while licking his ears - if it does involve "real creator" or "The original witch" He, the divination itself will also be in danger. For other people, just change the way of losing control or death, but Klein has a gray fog, not so miserable, it is obviously stronger than the detonation here. The real world is dead. He is worried that after repeated several times, he will be locked in position by the evil spirits and come and visit in person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly entered the state of meditation, silently reading the divination statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven or more times, he didn't have to open his eyes to know what the result was, because he was still sitting there, not suffering the ultimate pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the citrine pendant, I found that it was counterclockwise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Klein breathed a sigh of relief and immediately returned to the world, busy preparing for the ceremony, bringing the radio ticker out of the mysterious space above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for about half an hour, he finally heard the squeaking sound of the radio ticker, and an unreal white paper spit out with a line Lunwen:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am coming.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great master, is that you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to give me a feeling of probes... Klein Horan remembered an emoticon that she had seen in her life, that is the alpaca that is sprouting, going to The front probe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went up the first two steps, very arrogantly "hmm".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, the illusory white paper spits out more now:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your humble loyal servant Arrods is waiting to serve you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein will be uncomfortable hiding in the bottom of his heart and ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arrod Si, you tell me, where is Roy King of Life School? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the fat pharmacist's description, he knows that their organization evolved in the form of mentoring and inferring that they have "monsters" and "pharmacists" Two extraordinary ways, which are consistent with the characteristics of the life school.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Klein also prepared Roy King in a way that is not as good as others. The photo.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒哒哒 The voice of the 加剧 加剧 加剧 , , 魔 魔 魔 魔 魔 魔 魔 魔 魔 魔 魔 魔 魔 魔 魔 阿 阿 阿 阿 阿 阿 阿 阿 阿 阿 阿 阿 阿 阿 阿 阿 阿 阿 阿Comb, Roy. Kim wearing frame glasses.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is he? "A line of Lunwen is close behind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Arrods makes the squeak of the radio tickers extremely brisk:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The great master, the person you are looking for is locked in the Governor's House of 'Beauty City'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was locked in the Governor's Office? Klein's brows were slightly wrinkled, and he was not in a hurry to ask, very calm and very calm: <br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, according to your principles, you have to ask questions. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already asked, and you have answered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When? Klein first glimpsed and immediately looked at the content in front of the illusory white paper and saw the last question: "Is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is OK? This is also counted? At this moment, Klein thoroughly realized how freely the rules of the Mirror Arrodes are. In the face of the average person, how strict and strict it is, how bad it is, and even the onlookers. And when it comes to it, it is just a matter of coping with it, and blatantly releasing water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did this guy develop such a character... Kline thought for two seconds and turned to another question:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arodes, do you know the book "Grossel Travels"?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrods Silence For two seconds, the radio ticker immediately made a blunt blunt, spit out more illusory white paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great master, your question too Take care of me, I just need to answer the word 'know' to solve it. I helped you to modify it a bit and changed it to say 'What you know about Grosser Travels'.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a very amazing book, and many of its owners have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't see who the creator is, but it's clear that it first appeared in the dragon family, in the 'miracle city' Levi After Sid disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the disappearance of "The City of Miracles" in the "dream dragon", the "Miracle City" disappeared? Maybe I can sell it to Miss Justice. She may be interested. If she really buys it, as a middleman, I can study it in advance on the fog... What is the problem, the book is completely damaged, Just tell her the seller to repent, can only refund... So think, doing the platform is really promising! Klein's thoughts are transferred to the radio receiving machine: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to see what strange questions you can ask... Klein silently thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Arrods did not pause, and beat a line of Lunwen:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The great master, I have already asked, and you answered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When is it... Klein is funny and stunned to the illusory white Browsing in front of the paper, I finally found the so-called question at the very beginning: "Great master, is that you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have to say that this is called Arrod Sis’s mirror is really not a bit of a fucking thing to please me... However, the way it is paired in this way is really satisfying obsessive-compulsive disorder, much like the programming language I have learned before. {" and "}"... Klein cleared his throat and continued to ask questions: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is Roy Kim locked in the Governor's Office?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radio ticker vomits an illusory white paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the life school 'The one of the mercury When the snakes disappeared, they split inside and suffered a lot of dangers, and some even died in the hands of the 'Rose School'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Life School 'In the form of the inheritance of masters and apprentices, there is a secret development, but there is a Presbyterian at the top, coordinating the competition of different factions. Since the fifth period, the name of this Presbyterian Church has gradually become fashionable. Now it is called the 'Destiny Council', and there are seven members. The Mercury Snake is the Speaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roy. Kim’s teacher is one of the destiny members. After the disappearance of the Mercury Snake, there was a problem. Before that, he would be a life school. An important seal was handed over to Roy Kim, which is why Roy King was secretly arrested by the Lun Army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercury The snake is missing? Klein once recalled Will Anthony, who was hiding in Beckland, and another Mercury snake that pursued him but never showed up - this is suspected of "the angel of destiny" Ulos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
