			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon took the sedative in a glass test tube and looked at the seemingly pure liquid in his eyes, gently licking it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough is a nonsense person... Klein smiles again:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Sharon, can you tell me about the battle sites you have booked? I hope to be familiar with the surrounding environment in advance these days, so that you Wherever I choose, my preparation will be more complete."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And since the right to pick the last battle place is in their hands, they will not worry that I may report For the official organization or other extraordinary people who want to eat black... Of course, if you really trust, you can have another "notarization"... Klein thought quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon’s blue eyes watched him for a few seconds before he started:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back and prepare a map of Beckland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Expand on the coffee table."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, I hope this cooperation is not only smooth, but also enjoyable." Klein habitually went forward and shook hands with the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon looked down and his figure gradually became illusory and disappeared into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein moved his right hand up and took care of his black hair and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just asked the scheduled battle location, not only to prepare for the mission, but also to guard Sharon and Maric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the other party’s philosophy is to suppress and control desires, it is normal not to cross the river to break the bridge, but Klein can’t be sure of “resentment” Steve, “live corpse” Sen and "Werewolf" Tyre don't have anything they are eagerly awaiting. In the unlikely event that a normal extraordinary person will have a strong heart, in the face of two "dissimilar species," Kline can't guarantee that they will. Control yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, he must understand the environment in advance and reserve the escape route when the other party chooses to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not Klein’s distrust of Sharon, who has been through trouble, which is the most basic self-protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the victim is indispensable, and the heart of the person is indispensable... Klein turned his head and looked out the window, sighing in Chinese with a heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gas street lamp continued to sweep back, the street became more spacious and tidy, he spent more than half an hour, spent 3 Soules, and finally returned to Minsk street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a really expensive carriage..." Klein looked up at the almost black sky and the red moon that loomed through the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked forward for a while and suddenly found that there was no light at the lawyer's house, and it was dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put out the gold-shelled pocket watch, and glanced at it. Klein smiled and turned to the door of Jurgen and opened it with the key he gave. door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the black cat Brody has quietly squatted behind the door, looking at the visitors with a pair of green eyes, the darkness in the house, lonely Loneliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein squatted and tried to touch Brody’s head. As a result, the other side moved agilely and opened his hand in disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and laughed, got up and opened the valve, lit the gas lamp, and according to the description of Jurgen, went to the cabinet to find the prepared ingredients. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he entered the kitchen, ignited the water, and prepared to give Brody the boiled chicken breast that he loved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the black cat followed, and agile jumped onto the counter, squatting beside, not waiting to see Klein busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must miss Mrs. Doris very much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is not worried about her condition..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jurgen lawyer did not return home today, is your own aunt who is very lonely, uncomfortable, feels that there is no sense of belonging, feels tired and tired..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking, Klein’s voice is getting lower and gradually disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Cat Brody is still there, watching him quietly, no trouble, no call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Norma’s home, Audrey should come to the afternoon Tea activities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are mystery experts I said." Mrs. Norma enthusiastically introduced to the distinguished guests, "This is Hilbert Aru." Mr. Calder, he is a psychologist and a jewellery designer. He is very talented. This is Miss Islant Ossileka. She is a doctor in the spiritual field, which is what we often call a psychiatrist. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert Arukarde is a man in his forties who seems to have a bit of Southern European descent and a brownish complexion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is brown and blue, and the facial features are not color, giving a feeling of silence and restraint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Island Ossileka is a baby face lady, obviously a psychiatrist, who looks like a girl who is still studying at a public or grammar school. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a long black hair and a pair of blue eyes like a lake, which is three or four centimeters shorter than Audrey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey and the other person chilled a few words, sat down, keenly found that Arukard and Islant were observing themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not use her own "reader" ability, but did not know what to do, took the initiative to provoke the topic of occultism, and always pay attention Whether your emotions are in the most logical state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t let them discover that I’m already an extraordinary person, have taken the “audience” and “reader” potions... Audrey is very clear about himself today What role should I play? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the silent Arukard, Islant is a type of talkative, and after a few words, she asks:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know the New Year and the Great Moon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I haven't heard of it." Audrey Carefully use the knowledge that comes into contact with the occultist circle to give an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I have figured out from the "inverted man" what is the New Year, what is the big moon... She added a smile in her heart One sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The New Year refers to the number of years required for the rotation axis of the planet we are on, a total of 25,920 years. In the field of occultism, this is considered to be A complete cycle, from the beginning to the end, and the big moon refers to the number of years of this shift through one of the twelve constellations. Every big month is 2160 years. When the big moon alternates, a terrible disaster will come. According to calculations, We haven’t been away from the end of the current big month...” Islant talked and kept the atmosphere in a harmonious state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey hides the fact that he doesn’t know much, and asks the wrong question from time to time with curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, the beautiful afternoon tea time passed quickly, and Arukard and Islant also got up and left, leaving Mrs. Norma’s house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Audrey very disappointed, she thought that the other party would eventually hint at the psychological alchemy, and as a result, they said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, as a hidden, unexposed organization, the examination of the reserve members is not so simple and straightforward... It seems that at least several times have to be touched, and After secretly observing for a while, they can decide whether to disclose information to me, pull me into the meeting... This is also good, I just want to report to Mr. Fool! Audrey quickly wanted to understand why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Audrey, I see that you are also very interested in psychology. Why not consider trying to be a psychiatrist before you get married?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The Earl of Hall and his wife are both believers of the goddess and should support you to do similar things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no financial crisis between nobles In special circumstances, it takes a long process to reach a marriage. It must be strictly considered and compared before they can make a decision, because it is not just a matter of two young people, but also a family alliance and mutual assistance. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, although aristocratic women can be officially entered into social situations after the Queen’s 18-year-old, and they declare their adulthood, they can consider marriage, but according to statistics, they Forming a family is often after the age of 26. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the average age of the first marriage of aristocratic men who entered the political arena was 28.5 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Audrey has about 8 years to do what he likes when he is an adult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Night Goddess Church has always encouraged female believers to go out to work and engage in certain professions. In the aristocratic circle, many ladies and ladies have become literary critic, music. Home, pianist, painter, etc., etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a temptation? Audrey replied with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I still need to read more books."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She has always felt that people in psychological alchemists are not safe to be psychiatrists or psychologists, because the top officials of official organizations such as night servants and punitives should know how to play the law, and certainly have more attention to this group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Norma seems to be more satisfied with her answer, the dagger smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is Rand and Arukard are good teachers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, maybe I can consider Miss Islant as my psychology tutor. "Audrey slyly nodded." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday morning, after Klein got up, he found the coffee table on the living room. The Beckland map was circled in several places, and they were not too far apart, so he followed the prompts and used the morning time to carefully understand the surrounding environment and figure out which buildings were most recently. Where is the church? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, once again becoming free, he once again went to the Cragg Club to prepare for the practice of shooting and extraordinary ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just entered the hall and saw the surgeon with a cane, Alan Kris, slowly coming out of the cafeteria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sighing, he asked with concern:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allen, how recently Is the fortune better?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The innocent smile of Allen’s face reveals a sincere smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least not so bad!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went to the church according to your proposal, told the bishop about it, he let me directly Go to the confession room and pray to the goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the midst of prayer, I fell asleep, but I seem to feel that the goddess has given me peace and calm, from After that, my fortune is normal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let beautiful god!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is A red moon was drawn on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my experience, it should be that the "nightmare" of a sequence 7 allows you to enter the sleep, and then the night ceremonies who are good at the ceremony quickly set up the altar. Pray to the goddess and neutralize your unfortunate... Klein ups and downs: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is great!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
