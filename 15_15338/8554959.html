			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house in Jowood, where Hugh and Fols rented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls just finalized the new book and was in a good mood to prepare for a cigarette. At this time, Hugh pushed the door into the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Smoking is harmful to health." Hugh took a sniff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folse saw more doubts on her face, did not argue, and instead asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to have encountered something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have grabbed his rough blonde hair and sat down on the chair next to him:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person who contacted me before was the one who sold the 'Sheriff' formula to others through the meeting that Mr. A called.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He gave me a fairly simple task, the initial reward is 30 pounds, and I don't know if there is any hidden danger..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folsler recalls:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The man...there should be an organization behind him, but why would you think about pulling you? Isn't it afraid to be implicated in your IQ, leading to the complete destruction of the entire organization? You don't have anything to be conspired. It looks like it's okay, but it's too short. It's probably worth a life... Amount, what mission? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s used to being beaten by friends, ignoring the words in front of her, and directly answering the question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Investigate who has inquired about Ka Ping recently. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kaping? That should be hanged, no, the trafficker who was fired? Although Fols is not a bounty hunter, collecting material is a writer's instinct, so she often let Hugh tell stories and rumors.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happened nod: "It is him, but he is already dead, and it seems that he is still dead. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it dead?" Was it cut by a knife? "Folth asked quite happily and curiously.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person did not describe it in detail, maybe tomorrow's newspaper will speak. "I thought about it for two seconds." He only mentioned the special circumstances of the scene, saying that Kaping’s body was covered with tarot cards, and his face was covered with 'trial' and 'emperor' cards. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ‘trial’ card should mean ‘the trial of Kapyeong, the result is the death penalty’, what does the ‘emperor’ card stand for?’ The murderer, no, the identity of the hero? "The best-selling author, Fols, instinctively interprets the unique placement of the incident.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she stunned.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tarot? The body is full of tarot cards? Fols slammed the secret organization that he had just joined:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tarot will!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which member of our internal team will do it? There is no member of the codename "Emperor"... If it is, this is my first Once in the real world, I found traces of the Tarot... We are not just a hidden organization that exists only on the fog... The thoughts of the Furth are churning, there are surprises and worries.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, under the guidance of the waiter, entered the familiar living room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still only one candle in the room, the dim light will be surrounded by the scenes in the ghost story, and then paired with black robes and iron faces The mysterious person, this atmosphere is even more intense.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as soon as he stepped in, Klein suddenly had some inexplicable feelings.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that the swaying candle is staring at himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that the flame will burst open and ignite itself Hair and robes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that the curtains that hang down behind the belly window will sway, covering their bodies, covering the nose and mouth for breathing , forcibly kill yourself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what's the situation? Klein was awkward and nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a dangerous premonition, but it is an inconvenient inevitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein carefully found a position to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ass just touched the surface of the chair, he felt that the chair would burst out, and a large wooden thorn would follow his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds him of several videos that I have seen while on Earth - the inferior pneumatic lift seat exploded, the steel rod and the pieces pierced the owner Ass, drilled into the abdomen, the whole scene is bloody and fuzzy, terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there always such a bad association? Is it the negative impact of the physical injury in the previous battle? Klein looked around thoughtfully and found that the chubby pharmacist still didn't come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? Or have you left Beckland? Klein silently said a few words, and heard the "eye of wisdom" old man announced the beginning of the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time, Klein felt that the chandelier on the ceiling would fall obliquely and hit his head, sometimes thinking of the "eye of wisdom" old gentleman The coffee table in front of you will suddenly sway, tripping over yourself, and sometimes suspect that the party members around you are full of malice, and may be violent at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes him restless, alert and confused, and has no interest in paying attention to various or successful or aborted transactions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the dangerous premonition is occasionally vibrating a few times, reminding you that there is news coming in, there is a phone that the phone calls in, then the inexplicable instinct is equal to the moment. Electric drill, "shake" I can't relax, can't pay attention to other things... Klein tried to rub the forehead, but touched the cold iron mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, he felt that his iron mask would suddenly sag, cling to his face and remain embedded in his brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it really because the spirit is injured, it creates an illusion? Klein frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally wanted to ask for the pituitary and blood of the Thousand-faced Hunter’s brain at this gathering, but in such a situation, he can only give up cautiously. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Although the level of the organization of the "eye of wisdom" is not high, the high probability does not involve the more advanced monsters of the thousand hunters, but Klein believes that many members of the group have also participated in other gatherings, and may be able to get the corresponding information and clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unrest, Klein attended the party as a bystander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just took off his robes, took off his mask, left the room, and the inexplicable instinct that all the people had to persecute him before disappeared. The surprise is gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...Klein's pupils are miniature, confirming that the phenomenon just did not stem from the injury of the spirit, otherwise he is not likely to have both internal and external states. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suspected that there was an invisible, undetectable, and terrifying person and object in the living room where the party was held, so he was inspired to have the "divination" inspiration. Intuition and "clown" are dangerously premonitions themselves, but because of the suppression or special features of the other party, this kind of stimulation appears in a form that Lenovo is too rich, and does not alert itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is it? This is terrible. It is only the existence itself that gives me a reaction like a runaway precursor... Klein is quietly moving away from the house of the old man, the Eye of Wisdom, and heading for the nearest street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he had a guess:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a "Brave" bar nearby I, Miss Sharon and Maricie’s “resentment” Steve and others are responsible for monitoring the surrounding area...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their death will inevitably The high-ranking strongman of the rose school was angry and turned his attention to the extraordinary person who was active near the "Brave" bar...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that was just him ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, I used items such as "biotoxin bottles" and "sun brooch" tonight, and left them in fog to avoid being divined. Above... Otherwise, the result is unimaginable... The "magician" who has just completed an impossible performance will die directly here...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
