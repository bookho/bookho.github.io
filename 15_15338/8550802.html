			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horse Street, Divination Club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pressed the half-high silk hat on his head and walked down the stairs to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is no longer the usual dress, but a white shirt with a light vest, a black thin windbreaker with a knee-length outer cover, the whole person added a few points Fine temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This set of easy-to-fighting clothing costs him only 1 pound, including manual subsidies for sewing small pockets on the inside, which is cheaper than the tuxedo suit. People want to cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched the metal wheel in the left and inside small pockets of the gun bag, Klein pulled out the portrait and walked into the divination club . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No accident, he saw the beautiful lady Angelica, who was in charge of reception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Mr. Moretti, I thought you would come every few days." An Jielika is a glimpse, and it immediately outlines the splendid Smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took off his hat and sighed one by one:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon, An Jie Miss Lika, I had a dream at noon, dreamed of Mr. Heinz. Vincent, and dreamed about some things related to him. You know, as a diviner, you must not ignore every dream. That may be the revelation of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being confused by the temperamental words, Angelica nodded thoughtfully, curiously asked: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you dream of?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I dreamed that Hynas. Vincent was and This person is in dispute." Klein handed over the folded paper in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;趁安洁莉卡 buried his head to expand the portrait of the opportunity, he pinched his eyebrows, watching the other party's emotional color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This person..." Angelica looked at a photo-like portrait and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Kline, her emotional atmosphere is "thinking blue", which is a normal reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This person..." An Jielika whispered again and slowly looked up, "I have seen him."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s spirit is immediately retorted: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“When?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't think of a specific date. It should be a month. I saw him send Mr. Fansent to the door and whisper something, because of his thick and messy eyebrows, because Fansen Mr. Te’s rare smile, I was very impressed.” An Jielika recalled and said, “Yes, he has double gray-blue eyes, and his hair is the same as most men of his age. How much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After, or before, have you seen him yet?" Klein asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Jielika shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, certainly not, I don't even know What is his name? To be honest, if it weren't for you, I would suspect that the person who took out this portrait is the policeman who investigated the cause of Mr. Vincent's death. Oh, what revelation you get, I will not feel strange, you are a A true divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry, I am a policeman... Klein whispered aloud and sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The real diviner will understand his own smallness and the greatness of his destiny. We can only see the vague corners forever. We can only get revelation instead of answers. We must always reflect and remain awe. Carefully interpret, you can't think of yourself as a wise man who has mastered the fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete the experience of this time in a summary way, Klein suddenly found himself The vision is clear and a few points, and even some details of the color of the Anjilika gas field can be distinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, he wears the right amount of glasses like a nearsighted patient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... My "Divination" potion began to show signs of obvious digestion? Klein was there, but he couldn't believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't expect your diviner to remain fearful of fate. It's really admirable." Angelica said sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has seen too many people in the club who have just learned a few divination methods and claim to peek into the truth and change their destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein retracted his eyes and smiled low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The more you know, the more you can understand His own smallness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he reviewed his own state and past experience, and roughly grasped that the essence of "playing the law" is "to make a potion The behavior of the name, the hidden laws of the Ming Dynasty, and strictly demanding themselves." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only in this way can we adjust the state of body, mind, and spirit, close to the spirit of the remnants of the potion, and gradually digest it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recognition of the identity of the "Divination" is only a superficial factor. It makes it feel lighter and lighter because it is strengthened. It is itself a confirmation of certain divination behaviors, which together constitute a "divination code" that allows the potions to be digested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help others to interpret the revelation and guide them in the right direction, but they must always remain in awe of fate, not swell, not arrogant, not blind Interpretation of itself... This is the law that I have summarized so far, and it is also the essence of the next 'playing'. If it can continue to be effective, then I can not use it for half a year, maybe two or three months, maybe two or three weeks, it can be completely digested. "The magic potion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The symptoms just now are very obvious. No wonder the mysterious Mr. Zaratu said that when the potion was thoroughly digested, it was extraordinary. I can clearly understand that without the help of others, yes, it is not... just like now, although my spiritual vision has improved a bit, I know very well that this is only the node of digestion, not the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it, Klein couldn’t help but thank the clown in the tuxedo, he educated himself with his life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t have him, you may need to spend a few months at the Divination Club to conclude the Divination Code by repeating good or bad cases. ", start a strict "play". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moretti, sometimes I even feel that you are a philosopher." Hearing Klein’s answer, Angelica said with a sigh. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In my circle, philosophers are swearing words." Klein's mood became good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he took a gift, put on his hat, and left the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Angelica doesn’t know the name and identity of the gentleman on the portrait, Klein is not at all depressed, and the harvest is enough for him to The next step is planned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 36 Zouteland Street, within the Black Thorny Security Company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun ash looks at the portrait in his hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to use the troubleshooting Way to find this person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Klein has long organized the language. "Captain, I have not said that I have to go to the Divination Club to observe members. Did we react to the sudden death of Hainas Vansente? I didn’t find it yesterday, but today I accidentally knew that the people on the portrait had appeared together with Henas Vansente, and secretly talked about what I just said. Turned over the squad's investigation record and found that no similar people were recorded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His description has no problems, even if Dunn Smith now takes the portrait to the Divination Club It will also be confirmed from Angelica. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den removed his gaze from the portrait and smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no waste of money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Captain, are you not remembering badly, how do you remember the money at this time... Klein keeps smiling, Did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this what you painted?" Dunn asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I drew it with ritual magic." Klein replied with 100% truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, telling the truth and saying the whole truth are two things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng gently sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You make the old Neil a few more, I will let Cohenli and Luo Yao go to the investigation and ask the police to assist. If this clue is really useful, you will make a contribution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The goddess protects us." Klein clicked on his chest and his attitude was extremely religious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, Dunn can find out the name and identity of the gentleman on the portrait is enough, he can divination on the fog! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blackthorn Security Company, Klein on the rest day Instead of going home immediately, I took the public carriage to the dock area and arrived at the door of the "Dragon Bar". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has considered that although the "Divination" lacks direct means of defeating the enemy and does not have fast spells, the battle is divided into many types, not all of which belong to In the encounter, as long as there is sufficient preparation time, the "Divination" can also use ritual magic to deal with the enemy, just as he solves the magical divination incident at the Selena family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the "Divination" is best to carry some herbs, essential oils and small candles with you, so that you can't get the materials when you need them. Can only wait to die, after all, not everyone like Selena, put a bunch of occult items in their own home, just to be able to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the applications, Klein practiced too often and used it almost. The remaining pockets were inside the small pockets of his clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched the banknotes in his lower pocket and pushed away the heavy door of the "Dragon Bar" and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the afternoon, there are not many customers in the bar. There is no dog-catching game, no boxing contest, it seems quite deserted and not lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the two tables of friends who were drinking and playing cards, ready to head to the billiard room that leads to the underground trading market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he saw an old man with a sturdy, ruined navy officer jacket coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the friend that Daniel brought last time?" The blue-eyed old man with a rich wine smell looked at Klein. At a glance, smile and open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein vaguely guessed the identity of the other party, taking off the hat ceremony:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, no Know what to call you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Neil should mention you to me, I am the owner of this Swift." The blue-eyed old man has a strong arm. Muscles are strong and very temperamental. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former captain of the "Civil Penalty" squad... It is said that he once served as the Royal Navy... Kline politely responded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you temporarily lack money, you can come to me." Swein smiled One sentence, ready to go to the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Klein was in a hurry and quickly shouted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, Mr. Swein, I have something to ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swein stopped, turned half-turned, smiled and said:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You and you, um, your head is really like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I have no memory problems... Klein's mouth moved and he smacked out the portrait: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen this gentleman?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just suddenly thought that Selena should be led by Hynas Vansente in this underground trading market, and even let Elizabeth know the dragon bar, then, on the portrait Will this gentleman who has a certain relationship with Heiners Fancent have been here before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
