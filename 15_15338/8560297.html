			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, Klein has the same familiar feeling, it seems that every tree, every leaf, every stone, every small Grass, I want to put him to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the debris, paper and other garbage connected to the strange net is about to rush, his body suddenly shrinks and thins, turned into a paper man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrow-like branches penetrated the paper people and fell into the distance, and the strange nets were completely wrapped around them, wrapped in a ball, gently Creeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s body emerged seven or eight meters from the side, and the attack that knew that he was worried was still coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not make any observations, and he did not hesitate. He said that he would explore the pockets and take out the adventurer harmonica. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of situation I just encountered made him understand that the attacker has a high probability of being a half-god of the rose school, an enemy he can't currently fight against! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who had chased Sharon at the time gave him a similar feeling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the paper man in his pocket suddenly flew out and stuck it on his face, one after another, one layer at a time. ! At the same time, Klein’s sleeves tightened and pulled his arms and arms, stopping his palms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Taraba, his brown jacket, has shrunk inward, just like the giant bear is holding a hug! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one or two seconds, he was bound by his clothes, pants and shoes, his face covered with paper people, and the ribs were about to break. Breathing becomes extremely difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has both psychological preparation and rich combat experience. There is no confusion at this moment. The unaffected right thumb and middle finger are stuck together and they are smashed. sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s leg bends, the red flame swells up, burns the tights around his knees, and then spreads up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding this opportunity, Klein’s knees were awkward, and it’s hard to bounce, like a shell that was unable to land when it was launched, and rushed to the right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in the air and made a snap, this time the sleeves at the right arm joints were lit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where he stood, the green weeds suddenly withered, and the black ground instantly turned white, as if it had been weathered for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attack is silent, without warning. If Klein knows that the enemy is strong, staying in the same position is likely to encounter an unstoppable attack, first lifted The impact on his legs, he has now been hit hard, lost his fighting ability, and even ruined his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sound of the cricket, the two places of Klein’s sleeves ignited, and the right palm finally had space for activities, slid into the pocket, and caught the adventurer’s harmonica. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell to the ground, made a roll, his right hand was a support, let the body bounce, and the left palm of the human leather glove hit a Ringing fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, his goal was to stick people on his face and make him unable to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper man blazed, and the red flame tongue almost burned Klein’s hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he flashed a scene in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ice crystal The fine green arrow was rushing to his head at a very fast speed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the speed is very fast, because of its transparency, this fine arrow can't be found normally! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the thoughts flashed, his waist was barely bent, and the upper body fell backwards and moved to the right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold, tiny ice arrow hit his left chest, causing the brown jacket and all-white t-shirt in that part to smash instantly and fly to the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this deadly ice arrow failed to move forward, because it was in front of it a book with a dark brown cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book looks like ordinary, bounded by the common yellow-brown parchment into the inner page, but not broken like the outer two layers of clothing, even a gap Have never appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grossel Travels! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "Lightning Storm" of the "Poseidon Scepter" plus the mysterious space a little power frontal bombardment of the damaged items! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no doubt that Klein, who was scared by the "I saw you" telegraph last night, added new protection measures and could think of it. All are ready! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to hiding the travel notes in the deadly area, he also has an iron cigarette case in his other pocket, which contains contaminated "fire" gloves. If not, he will lift the wall of spirituality and throw out this item to see if he can attract the attention of the "real creator" and let him send the strong men to come over and make the situation more chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the "real creator" and other evil spirits also hate the "desire mother tree"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After blocking the ice arrow, Klein fell down and rolled over, and put the adventurer harmonica to his lips and blew it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, his face was a little blackened by the smoke of the paper man, but he was not injured because of the help of the "manipulation of the flame." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he felt that his left arm, waist, thighs, neck, and feet were back to normal, and he regained his freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While blowing the harmonica, he quickly opened his vision and saw the messenger coming out of the void, carrying four blonde red-eyed heads in his hand. Turn and look to the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the heads slammed, his mouth opened and he took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind of the wind blew up, a hundred meters away from Klein, a figure was forcibly pulled out of the green trees by the invisible force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure can't maintain the state that others can't see, and it quickly becomes translucent and semi-real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a brown-black old man with sparse white hair and deep wrinkles. His facial features are very characteristic of the South China. His brown eyes just reflect Renee. . Nikol's look, the brow could not help but jump, and then did not hesitate to open his mouth, seems to give the other party the long-term silence to brew the ultimate curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, another head of Renee Nikol’s head opened his mouth, as if he was making a silent scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, nothing happened in this woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacks saw it, he turned his head and looked at Klein. Klein hadn’t had time to react, and the left and right eyes showed each other’s white. Exaggerated figure of sparse wrinkles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mind is getting cold, his thoughts are not slow, but he loses control of his body. He can only watch the white-haired old man disappear and turn his face. Yes, Miss Messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenitt. Nikol’s two heads suddenly flew out and came to Klein. They opened their mouths and breathed in. A red eye is darkened, the teeth are long, and the roots are sharp, between the illusion and the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw that the translucent white-haired sparse old man was forcibly "smashed" out of his body, and then the head of the messenger’s teeth became bitten. His shoulders, biting off a large piece of something like a physical body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
