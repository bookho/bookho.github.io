			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ximem Island, under the leeward, under the towering stone walls, the deep sea water is affected by the surrounding waves, and the same is not a small fluctuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mad captain" Connor Victor's "single-eyed nickname", several pirates put on the cloak, pulled up the hat, drenched and hit the body The faint rainwater of the people, facing the frenzied wind that can promote children, walked out of the cabin and checked four times to avoid accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are cloaks made of linen, but the surface is coated with a viscous liquid that has solidified. The rain does not penetrate and can only flow downwards and fall to the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liquid is the sap of the Doringsman tree, produced in the rainforest of the South Continent, is a natural rain-proof material, because it is more common, the price is originally Very low, but last year, the research team suspected that it had a significant effect on promoting hair growth, and it has grown considerably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This weather is suitable for the 'Red Theatre', drinking spirits, smoking marijuana, licking a woman!" A pirate probe looked Outside the eye of the ship, complained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companion has pulled the cloak hat to the ground:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that 'red The theater 'has recently approved a new shipment, I really want to try it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?" Another pirate asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirate just laughed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard what you said, you are not I don't know what the captain is doing 'business'? So I know a lot of traffickers, ha, they like to call themselves slave traders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking of this, I remembered that time.” The earliest talking pirate showed an aftertaste. “There was a noble lady who left home, the skin, the figure, the look, oh, simple, simple, I don't know what to say, anyway, I can't forget it today, but unfortunately, she actually committed suicide!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they talk, they feel brighter in front of them Subconsciously looking up into the air, I saw the torrential rain that was rushing down. Abnormally, silver and white electric light swam in the dark clouds that covered the red moon and the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, together with a huge lightning bolt that illuminates the surrounding waters, goes straight to the upper deck of the "single-eyed nickname"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electric snake began to smash, and the deafening thunder echoed in the pirate's ear when the wooden structure of the cabin ignited the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow-up, the silver and white lightnings that flaunted the claws again and again fell, and the "single-eyed nickname", the small-sized sailboat, entered the Thunder in an instant. forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the huge lightnings that were almost intertwined were suddenly separated, and they were separated according to the law of nature, failing to hit the "single-eyed nickname" It is surrounded by the dark water, so that the nearby ocean is lit up, and the small electric snake that sizzles can be seen everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirates on the deck were affected, and one was already black, like burnt wood. The two fell down and twitched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein above the fog through the picture To this scene of the "Lightning Storm" being resolved, I couldn't help but feel a feeling in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is sure that this must be a semi-god power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he sneaked into the "single-eyed nickname", even if there was "squirming hunger", there was a "cancel the clock" revolver, there is "Grossel Travels", also It is impossible to make effective resistance under such strange powers, and at that time, there is no time to pray to themselves, and to respond to the "Poseidon Scepter" on the fog! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indulge in a deep breath, Klein let the blue-blue gems at the top of the white bone scepter all illuminate instead of one after another! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brought a very uncomfortable experience to the pirates. One or two had the urge to vomit blood, but this was only a prelude. The sound of the sound of the water was fierce, the direction of the stone wall was facing, and the deep black waves rushed. Get up, close to 10 meters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wave is like a wall made by a god, pushed by the invisible hand, and flocked to the "single eye nickname"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the tsunami made by Klein! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can already be called a natural disaster! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the bang is like an explosion. The pirates inside the ship look at the dark sky outside, the dark clouds and the huge waves, as if they have come to myths and legends. At the end of the day, all lost the will to save themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they desperately wait for the final trial, inside the huge waves of the tsunami, there is a chaos that is not logical and scientific, an indescribable whirl Forming, tearing the whole, let the horrible waves crash at a rapid speed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bang of the mountain collapse, the secondary wave threw the "single-eyed nickname" high and threw it into the air, before Some of the water splashes caused by the disintegration of the giant waves splashed onto the ship, and the mast was smashed, the cabin was broken and the deck was completely submerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A violent wind suddenly became fierce, spontaneously wrapped up around the companions, turned into a hurricane that surpassed its own limit, and hardened the "single-eyed nickname" in the air. Outer sea direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the ship was flying in the air like this, and it rushed out of the sea for a while, and it did not fall to the undulating water. As if it were an airship, it continued to move smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is different from the half-god or corresponding layer seal in the "single-eye nickname" to crack the tsunami, and sighs that its sequence is not enough, even if it is mobilized The slightest power of the mysterious space above the fog did not create the tsunami that Cavituva had been able to destroy the port. On the other hand, it was necessary to control the hurricane, so that the "single-eyed nickname" lost its reliance and fell directly, lest it escape. It is within 5 nautical miles that it can influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His goal at this time is not to destroy the "single-eyed nickname", nor to catch the "crazy captain" Connors Victor, but to force the ship The demigod or the corresponding level of seal appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong person and object of this person, even in the whole world, can count it clearly, seeing their appearance, sooner or later they can know that they are Who, which organization belongs to! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the direction of the follow-up investigation of the Bakerland smog event! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only hope that it is not a "divination" approach, otherwise who knows if it is his real face... However, this is also a good thing, not only to investigate the smog The truth of the tragedy, figure out what Ins Zangweier is doing, prepare for the revenge, and also find the potion formula and main material of the "Mage Master"... Klein silently sighs and lets "Poseidon A gem at the top of the scepter emits a pure cyan glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the flight of "single-eyed nickname" has changed. It crashes down like a stone, and even gliding can't be done! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, it became very light and light, and the action that fell on the surface of the sea was like a feather that passed the human face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein, who has consumed a lot of spirituality, is about to make up the effort to create a tsunami, and suddenly hear an explosion of loud noise in the picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a terrible sonic boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is different from the normal sonic boom, and it seems to be mixed with the whine of the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comes from "Sea King" Yann Courtman! Although he still has a long distance from here, he can control this area of ​​the sea, and can exert influence on the way to the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sequence 3, the saint who is close to the angel level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
