"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uldi Blanche replied subconsciously.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he pointed to mold The place where the head was purified, hurriedly asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who maintained the Galman Sparo, did not answer, looked at Daniz, crossed the Donna family directly, and arrived. The door is closed in front of the lime restaurant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flame" Daniz carries the lantern, because it is a lot easier to finish a goal, he straightens his back Look at Uldi and others, screaming: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to worry about what it is, remember that it is a monster that will hurt you. Just fine. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn't for Greman Sparo, just a few meters away, he even wanted to declare that only me, "flame" Daniz, can protect you. !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crevis and Cecil and Teague look at each other and take the initiative to comfort the employer:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait back to the white agate and ask again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, their three bodyguards have been long or short-time adventurers, and the perception of monsters remains in folklore. Legends and peers are fascinated by this level. At this time, it is inevitable that some of them are dreaming.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for them, since they have seen the creature of the fisherman, other things It’s not so too difficult to accept, at most, it’s a bit more eccentric than the fisherman’s ugly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thoughts, they have a lot of stability inside, the guns in their hands It seems that the power has been recovered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the pure light that descended from the sky is still beyond their understanding, only the long-standing world outlook, outlook on life and Values ​​have been shaken, and they can only be ignored for the time being, and all emotions are pushed to the bottom of their hearts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stopped at the door of the lime restaurant and raised his right hand. , 指指敲.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚!咚!咚!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked three times in a rhythm, and no one answered, it was quiet.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not there is still candlelight from The windows and the cracks in the door are clear, and Klein would even think that this is an empty house that has been abandoned for a long time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚!咚!咚!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked three more times.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the restaurant, the silence is still the same, everyone seems to be obeying the foggy weather Does not respond to the custom of percussion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein retracted his right hand and patted the hem of a double-breasted long dress.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he leaned back and lifted his knees and pulled forward his right foot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door slammed, the restaurant’s door jerked After the open, the nails that hold the copper locks all came out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing in a tuxedo, the face is fleshy, the nearly round boss Fox still stands in the original position, choose Staying ladies and gentlemen They have opened the door, quietly standing on the dividing line, silently looking at the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" Fox was not angry, his tone was as good as before, but he had more revolvers in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opened the vision of Klein turning his head and looking around, not discovering the traces of evil from the human beings present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes fell on the restaurant owner, his eyes calmed down and looked at each other’s eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Fox and the other side suppressed the emotions, as if the dark brown eyes that brewed the storm looked at each other for two seconds, unnaturally twisting their heads:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , the foreigner, upstairs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let them come down." Klein indifferently told. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox was silent for a few seconds until the other side quickly pulled the gun and aimed at his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a breath and sent a waiter to the second floor, carrying the Dimudo family down the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Dimudo is a man who is less than thirty, this time on vacation with his newlywed wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein dropped his gun and said plainly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Banxi Port has changed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you going back to the boat with me, or staying here?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change? While Dimodo chewed the word, he saw the outside of Uldi Blanche focusing on himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the other person is very rich The import and export trader, with three bodyguards, believes that if there is any change, it is safer to stay with the other party, so the answer is self-evident.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp As for the unique customs of Banxi, it is just a custom! He took the hand of his newlywed wife and walked to the door, politely laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All of us They are all on board, of course, with you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you. He and his new wife also thanked him and crossed Klein to meet the Blanche family outside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took back the revolver, very polite The land whispered to the boss Fox:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he turned his body and walked to the light of the restaurant, and went to Crevis and others.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blinking, the door of the lime restaurant closed again and was shaken a little by the wind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was actually aware of some Unusual, subtle atmosphere, but since the vision is not harvested, he does not want to go deeper, so as not to ignite the huge danger hidden in Banxi.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returns to Nepal Next to it, the number of people in the light of the lanterns was swept away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangna family of four, three bodyguards, Dimudo couple, and several servants, Qi Klein exchanged the position of the revolver and the cane, lifted the right palm of the gun, and explored the double-breasted long dress, and rubbed the "sun brooch".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The dark golden light flashes, the invisible power spreads out quickly, and the waves flow through the place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, the church Waiting for someone to come to the south, bathing in the warm sunshine, dispelling the chills in the body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are no longer so nervous and worried, they seem to have found their own The courage, the slight blackness of the special bacon that was previously enjoyed in Port Damir, together with a very small amount of evil, quickly melted away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun Halo" can improve twenty The courage of the companions in the range of meters, and purify the evil forces in their bodies!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of spell ability with the help of the brooch is controlled by Klein's spirituality and spirit. He can let the power of the sun bypass the goal that he does not want to help.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the telegraph office first. Klein repeated it, holding the stick on the left, holding the gun in his right hand, distinguishing the direction, and moving forward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz followed his instructions and walked On the slant side, Krivis, Cecil and Teague took the warning in two other directions very professionally.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned into his pocket with his left hand, removed the spiritual wall of the iron cigarette case, took out the Azick copper whistle, held it in his palm, and sometimes threw it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that those undead monsters with only one head left will definitely forget others. There is only this brass-colored old whistle in the "eyes"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, I don't have to worry about the rescue, this is the role of MT! Klein sighed and accelerated his pace a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, three dry moldy heads flew out in the misty mist in front, and they rushed to Klein from different directions like arrows. I completely ignored the existence of other delicious flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three! Daniz's pupils shrank, a little worried that Galman Sparo would be in a hurry, and some expect each other to show real strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three... Klein shakes his left palm without hesitation, throwing the Azick copper whistle into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flying heads that dragged the esophagus immediately drew an arc and headed for the most important goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a step back and raised his hand and pinched the "sun brooch" without expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, the location of the copper whistle produced a cluster of golden dense flames out of thin air, and the sacred atmosphere filled the atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fire of Light"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three skinny heads screamed at the same time, turning into a clump of powder in the golden light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the first two steps and reached for the Azick copper whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Can it still be like this? Is it a magical item? Daniz stunned for two seconds and only realized that the problem was solved too easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Dimodo and his wife also saw what the things that had just attacked everyone looked like, a scared face turned white, a panicked Asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That, what is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna immediately turned and nodded seriously道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait back to the white agate and ask again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she erected Fingers, against the lips, mimic the meaning of Uncle Sparrow giving "no ban". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dimdo thought of the sacred breath that the young man in front of him showed, and he swallowed his mouth and pulled his wife’s hand, silently silent, servant When people see it, they can only obey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team continued on the street with only a thin moonlight, the lights in the houses on both sides were extinguished, and the darkness behind the convex window was invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donna always feels that there are a pair of eyes in the movement that follow him and others, but because of certain factors, no one shows up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They must be afraid of Uncle Sparrow! She tightened her brother's hand and walked in the protection circle of her parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, there was a figure on the side of the street. He was wearing a black cloak and leaning forward to reveal the still bloody neck and above the neck. Empty, only the lining of the cloak reflects the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headless man made a beast-like low-pitched voice, and he rushed to Klein, stepping on the street and shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location it passed was just in contact with Daniz, the famous pirate snorted, waved his arm and pulled a bunch of it from the palm of his hand. Compressed orange fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball exploded, and the headless man threw back a few steps back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
