			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derville’s bedroom is larger than the Klein’s living room plus dining room, consisting of a bed part, a living part, a dressing part, a wash section and a bookcase desk section. Exquisite furnishings and extravagant details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the feeling of Klein, the light is dark here, and the temperature is at least half lower than the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, his ears seemed to hear a cry of another cry, and a dying struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was a little embarrassed, and everything was back to normal: the bright sun penetrated the window and sprinkled the entire bedroom; the temperature was neither high nor low; The surrounding police, bodyguards and housekeeper were silent and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...He looked sideways at the classical and gorgeous bed and saw a pair of fuzzy eyes in the shadows circling, like a gas lamp Not afraid of dead moths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps, close to there, Klein’s “Lingshi” lost the picture he had just seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a standard soul, it’s not a bad spirit... What exactly? Klein frowned and recalled the mysterious knowledge he had mastered during this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his view, today’s task is handed over to the “collector”, handed over to the “digger” and handed over to the “Psychic”, I am afraid It's a bit difficult, but it's obviously not the area he is best at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The urge to endure the direction of divination, Klein slowly looked around and looked for other traces to prove a few guesses in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This, Inspector." Sir Deville hesitated, "What did you find?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's so easy to find out, I don't think my colleague will wait until now." Klein spoke up and looked down at the big philanthropist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was about to take his eyes off, he suddenly noticed a white figure in the mirror behind Sir Deville. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it’s a white figure that overlaps and twists together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure passed away, and Klein seemed to hear a vague cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... He vomited and relieved the fear of just getting scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased inspiration, opened the mind, and sooner or later will be scared... Klein uses his own way to ease his tension and then revisit his sight Voted for Sir Deville. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he saw something different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this bedroom, Sir Deville, there are occasional white, twisted shadows flashing around, making the light slightly faint in that area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every flash is bound to be accompanied by an illusory cry that is difficult for normal people to hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A normal person is difficult to hear under normal conditions? Because of the daytime? Klein thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a preliminary judgment on this case:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entanglement of Sir Deville is Resentment is the spiritual residue caused by the most difficult emotions before human death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of resentment and residue will become a horrible evil if it is accumulated for a while and then several times stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir Deville is a famous philanthropist, even if Benson is so picky, he is very respectful to him, how can there be so many "death resentment" "Wounded? duplicity? The means of the unscrupulous extraordinary? Klein wondered if it was possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it and looked at Deville, and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please speak." Deville sat down weakly and weakly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein organizes language channels:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you leave here, go to a new place, For example, the villages, such as Beckland, have gained a brief peace of mind for at least half a night, and then the situation slowly recovers, becoming more and more serious. When you go to sleep during the day, you will hear you cry and cry.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deville’s eyes squinted open, and the blue eyes were a little more radiant:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, you Find the root of the problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He discovered that due to long-term insomnia and poor mental condition, he even forgot to tell the police about such an important clue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Klein’s question was answered affirmatively. Inspector Tolle secretly sighed and understood that the night-timers found clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sergeant Gate was surprised and curious, and couldn’t help but look at psychologist Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the entanglement of resentment, a little bit of agglomeration... Klein, who got feedback, basically confirmed the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he now has two ways to help Sir Deville get rid of the troubles, one is to arrange the altar directly around the other side, relying on ritual magic to completely remove the "death resentment", The second is to use other occultal means to find the source of the problem and solve the problem fundamentally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering the phrase "Try not to let ordinary people know the existence of extraordinary power", Klein intends to try the second method first, and pray for the goddess without any effect. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jazz, you are mentally ill, mental problem." He looked at Deville, a serious nonsense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Deville frowned and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, I am Mental patients, need to go to the madhouse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not so serious, in fact most people have more or less psychological and spiritual problems." Klein appeased, "Please allow me to re-introduction. I am a psychologist at the Ahowa County Police Department."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Psychology Specialist "Deville and his butler looked at the acquaintance Toller inspector at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tole Zheng’s key point is that it is indeed true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, what do I need to do to work with the treatment? And, I don't understand why my butler, my bodyguard, my servant can hear the cry." Hehe..." Deville held his cane with both hands, his face confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has a very professional answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will explain it to you afterwards." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trouble you please ask your butler, your servant and your bodyguard to go out, Tolre Inspector, Sergeant Gat, please leave with me too, I need A quiet environment for initial treatment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usage "treatment"... Tolre inspector silently helped him make a sentence and ordered to Sir Devil Under the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deville is silent for a dozen seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Karen, you take them to the second floor The living room is waiting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Jazz." Butler Karen did not refute because the request was made by a formal police officer, a trainee inspector, and a psychologist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing them leave and close the door in turn, Klein looks to the dark-haired, blue-eyed Deville Road:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jazz, please lie down on the bed, relax and try to fall asleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...OK." Deville Hang the coat and hat on the coat rack, walk slowly to the bed and lie up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He untied the pendant and quickly made a simple judgment with the "spirit", then sat down on the rocking chair not far from the end of the bed, sketched the light ball, entered the meditation, and let the spiritual world appear in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he leaned back on the back of his chair and fell asleep, letting his own star spirits come into contact with the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is using the technique of "dream divination" to let himself "communicate" with the entanglement of Sir Devil's resentment in a spiritual environment similar to dreaming. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only communication can get an answer to solve the problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sad crying illusion haunts Klein’s ear, and he “sees” a trailing, transparent and transparent figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hebrew, lotus, lotus, the scream of pain came, and Klein, who reluctantly recovered his ability to think, extended his right hand and touched it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, that figure became a moth to fight the fire, one after another cast it to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s eyes were steeply blurred, his head seemed to be split in half, half in a calm look, and half saw a “mirror”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "mirror" is a young girl dressed and strong, she walks in a dusty factory, her head hurts after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes are blurred and her body is getting thinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to hear someone calling her Charlotte, saying she has general hysteria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hysteria? She looked into the mirror and saw a blue line on her gums. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lens" turns, Klein seems to see it again, the avatar becomes A girl named Mary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is also in the lead factory, young and lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, her half of her cheeks began to twitch continuously, followed by the arms and legs on the same side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have epilepsy." She heard someone say this in her body convulsions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She twitched down, the degree became more and more intense, and finally lost consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another girl, she is unhappy, stupidly messed up on the street Strolling, even the language barriers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her headache is very serious, her gums have a blue line, and she has convulsions from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She met a doctor who said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lafo, you This was affected by lead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor looked at her with pity and watched her twitch again, several times in a row, watching her lose in her eyes All look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture is presented in Klein’s mind, he is half immersed, Half is to observe calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he thoroughly understood the experiences of these girls:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are long-term exposure to lead white, Female workers who have been exposed to dust for a long time, they died of lead poisoning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sir Deville has exactly one lead factory, two ceramic factories, all employing relatively low-priced women workers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein silently "looks" at it and feels that there is only one thing left unclear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
