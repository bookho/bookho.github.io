			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaiting for nearly ten minutes outside the Great Prayer Hall, Klein and other believers who participated in the Moon Mass, entered under the guidance of the pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dim and quiet atmosphere, they are greeted by neat and ethereal mourning:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The full moon of blush rises, reflecting the earth,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone has sunk into a sweet dream, dreaming of himself,<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Dream parents and children, this is forever...” (Note 1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holy and rhythmic layers of sound During the resurgence, the believers in the Great Prayer Hall were involuntarily calmed down. They seemed to have forgotten the troubles of life and no longer worried about the problems of the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They, under the guidance of several pastors, each found a position to sit, in front of the altar, responsible for the great mass, Bishop Electra holding "The Night Revelation, start a simple sermon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the end of the session came to an end, the priests picked up the water and bread and distributed it to Klein and others. This is the night’s favor, which is shared by the living and the dead. food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who has not yet had dinner, naturally did not waste the plain bread and the water in the cup, and then saw a candle on the altar light up. Against the backdrop of the darkness, it seems as the stars of the night, giving off the peace of mind and heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Bishop Electra took the priests and the choir owners, once again mourning:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will look up at the night sky,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" warmly say his name: 'night goddess! '<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides the 'night goddess', there is no other words,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like the goddess The gap between angels singing<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take them together with sweet silence,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In his gentle right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Goddess!' If He hears, he will promise,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"will definitely be dead Revealing a pure smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Come on, rest, sleep, my children!' (Note 2)<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the empty silence has penetrated into the ears of every believer with a sacred feeling, and seems to resonate with all the spirits present, as a supernatural person of sequence 5, Klein At the same time, it seems that there is a feeling that the spirit body is washed, and the spirituality flows naturally and soothingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, there seems to be a quiet darkness in front of him, without the darkness of the slightest sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, a corpse lay there, pale and serene, as if not dead, just sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s mind settled peacefully in this darkness, suddenly struggling and looking to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the moon flower blooms quietly, sleeping several people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are Dunn Smith who doesn’t wear a hat and a windbreaker. It’s an old Neil who still wears a black classical robe. It’s a Cohen who doesn’t work hard to save money. Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They relaxed their eyes and their mouths seemed to have a very light smile. There was a piece of tombstone standing around, each with the same words: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guardian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed his eyes and the ears rang That holy and ethereal voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put it on your chest,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do the silent prayer,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use you The inner cry:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only destination is peace! (Note 3)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein lowered his head, closed his eyes, raised his hands, crossed his chest, and then repeated silently: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only destination is peace! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only destination is peace! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and over until the Great Prayer Hall becomes extremely quiet, Klein Only then opened the eyes and raised his hand to the corners of the lower sides.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly vomited and glanced at the left and right, using the light of the candlestick, he found Most of the believers were full of tears and didn't know each other. Even their own personal servant Richardson also slammed the tears down and did not wipe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The moon mass is closer to a ritual, and the ritual of extraordinary power participation should be to resonate with the spirit of everyone, so that different people can see the close deceased in the dark, release grief, and obtain peace... Well, this is not a change for the extraordinary. I can rest assured... For ordinary people, this is the illusion of the moment and the venting of the inner emotions. It only thinks that the goddess is great and does not doubt the supernatural power... Sequence 5 of the 'night' route seems to have greatly improved in the control of the spirit... Klein retracted Look, make judgments in my heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he recalls the darkness, remembering the dead who are lying among the moon flowers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed his eyes, Klein let his thoughts spread out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dark plains of the moon flower, the night vanilla, and the deep sleep flower are some kind of representation of the goddess god country? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the source of danger in the night of the ruins of the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein The mind gradually outlines the cold night seen in the easternmost part of the Sunia Sea and the fog that covers the sea under the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fog, there is a dark, ancient spire church, a crow circling on it, like a memorial, like a mourning, and the church is still around There are ordinary houses, simple wooden houses, gray mills and shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, this foggy scene, which is closely related to the night and the dream, should be formed by the breath of the goddess or the devil's wolf Fregra. But there is nothing in common with the presentation of the corresponding kingdom of God... Well, mortals can't spy on the gods, maybe the dark plains full of flowers and grass just not the projection of the kingdom of God, but the product of the ritual... Klein sees The moon mass has come to the end, and the palm is stretched out into the inner pocket of the garment and the wallet is taken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds the wallet, gets up and enters the aisle, all the way to the altar, in the merciful and compassionate expression of the Archbishop Electra, slanting to the dedication box before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the chest clockwise four times, after drawing the blushing month, Klein cast all the big money into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of £300! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Klein was not as painful and sad as he was a few times ago, and he was very calm because he remembered the ceremony of returning money from Old Neil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, under the blessing of the goddess, they found a wallet with more than three hundred pounds of cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step back, once again painted a blushing month, he gave the position to the donor behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Archbishop Electra took the initiative to welcome him and said that he clocked the red moon and said:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May Goddess bless you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Electra looked at the exit on the side of the prayer hall:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't mind waiting for a quarter of an hour, I can tell you in the library. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly what I longed for." Klein smiled softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop Electra immediately led a pastor to lead Daun. The chief servant of Tangtes walked out of the big prayer hall from the side passage and went around to the spiral staircase. The library room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two large bookshelves here, which are filled with various books related to the Goddess of the Night, and some tables and chairs are arranged on both sides. For the pastor bishops to learn and use to the followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve minutes later, Bishop Electra entered the library with a calm smile and saw the white temperament of the corner. Tess is standing in front of a row of bookshelves and looking at a book intently, which is very scholarly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking at?" he asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed the book and laughed at himself: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Revelation of the Night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Frankly speaking, although I sincerely believe in the goddess, I have been busy with life for many years, and I have never calmed down to read this holy book seriously. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he has no abnormalities on his surface, but his heart is a little embarrassed, afraid that the goddess directly gives a lightning to reward the devout believer.斯.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, lightning is not in the realm of the goddess... Klein comforted himself in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Bishop Electra smiled and took the "Revelation of the Night": <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is not too late from now on. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately asked Dawn. Dontes to sit down at a table and systematically explain the composition and inside of "The Revelation of the Night" for the other party. Key words.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richardson took the employer’s hat and cane, sat a little further away, waited quietly, and listened The bishops preached.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times passed by, and the inspiration of Klein’s inspiration was striking, and the scene outside the mind naturally emerged. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his intuitive premonition, stemming from the "clown", the intuition that has been strengthened by the fog!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Outside the door, an old man with a black robe of clerics passed there and walked to the spiral staircase nearby.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His white hair is still dense But it didn't do anything to comb, it looked quite messy, his face was thin, there was a feeling that the skin directly wrapped the bones, the temperament was quite cold, the skin was very pale, and the eyelids were rare black.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure quickly disappeared into the doorway, and the sound of footsteps gradually increased in the distance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal caretaker But it wasn't the one I met in the big prayer hall... Well, today is his turn? Klein looks at the bishop of Electra with a focus on the content of the Holy Scriptures.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He appeared inside the church at the time of the internal caretaker, and was not surprised by the library, because the seal power behind the door of Chanis would reach its peak at night. It is no longer suitable for living creatures, so the internal caretakers are all entering the sunrise, leaving the sunset, and now the sky is all black.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember today is the number After the day of the week... gradually increase the corresponding information, and find out the internal caretaker's rotation law, so that you can play the appropriate goal at the right time... Klein retracts his thoughts, listens carefully, and starts to resign after half an hour. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiles at Electra Road: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "if there is the pleasure of listening to your sermon after I do not know? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
