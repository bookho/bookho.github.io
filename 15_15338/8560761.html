			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaiting for nearly ten minutes outside the Great Prayer Hall, Klein and other believers who participated in the Moon Mass, entered under the guidance of the pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dim and quiet atmosphere, they are greeted by neat and ethereal mourning:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The full moon of blush rises, reflecting the earth,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone has sunk into a sweet dream, dreaming of himself,<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Dream parents and children, this is forever...” (Note 1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holy and rhythmic layers of sound During the resurgence, the believers in the Great Prayer Hall were involuntarily calmed down. They seemed to have forgotten the troubles of life and no longer worried about the problems of the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They, under the guidance of several pastors, each found a position to sit, in front of the altar, responsible for the great mass, Bishop Electra holding "The Night Revelation, start a simple sermon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the end of the session came to an end, the priests picked up the water and bread and distributed it to Klein and others. This is the night’s favor, which is shared by the living and the dead. food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who has not yet had dinner, naturally did not waste the plain bread and the water in the cup, and then saw a candle on the altar light up. Against the backdrop of the darkness, it seems as the stars of the night, giving off the peace of mind and heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Bishop Electra took the priests and the choir owners, once again mourning:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will look up at the night sky,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" warmly say his name: 'night goddess! '<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides the 'night goddess', there is no other words,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like the goddess The gap between angels singing<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take them together with sweet silence,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In his gentle right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Goddess!' If He hears, he will promise,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"will definitely be dead Revealing a pure smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Come on, rest, sleep, my children!' (Note 2)<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the empty silence has penetrated into the ears of every believer with a sacred feeling, and seems to resonate with all the spirits present, as a supernatural person of sequence 5, Klein At the same time, it seems that there is a feeling that the spirit body is washed, and the spirituality flows naturally and soothingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, there seems to be a quiet darkness in front of him, without the darkness of the slightest sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, a corpse lay there, pale and serene, as if not dead, just sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's mind settled peacefully in this darkness, suddenly struggling and looking to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the moon flower blooms quietly, sleeping several people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are Dunn Smith who doesn’t wear a hat and a windbreaker. It’s an old Neil who still wears a black classical robe. It’s a Cohen who doesn’t work hard to save money. Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They relaxed their eyes and their mouths seemed to have a very light smile. There was a piece of tombstone standing around, each with the same words: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guardian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed his eyes and the ears rang That holy and ethereal voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cross your hands,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Chest,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doing the silent prayer,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And use your heart to shout: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only destination is peace!" (Note 3)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein lowered his head, Close your eyes, raise your hands, cross over your chest, and repeat them silently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only destination is peace!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only destination is peace!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and over again, until the Great Prayer Hall became extremely quiet, Klein opened his eyes and raised his hand to the corners of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly took a breath and glanced at the left and right. With the light of the candlestick, he found that most of the believers were full of tears and didn’t know, even their own The personal servant Richardson also slammed the tears down and did not wipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moon Mass is closer to a ritual, a ritual with extraordinary power participation, the role should be to resonate with everyone's spirit, so that different people can see in the dark Closely deceased, release grief, get peace... Well, this is not a change for the extraordinary, I can rest assured... For ordinary people, this is the illusion of the moment and the venting of the inner emotions, only I think that the goddess is great, there is no doubt that there is supernatural power... The sequence of the 'night' route 5 seems to have greatly improved in the control of the spirit... Klein regained his gaze and made judgments in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he recalled the darkness and remembered the dead who were lying among the moon flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed his eyes, Klein let his thoughts spread out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dark plain with moon flowers, night vanilla, and deep sleep flowers is some kind of representation of the goddess god country?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The danger source of the night of the god war, What does it correspond to? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's mind gradually outlines the cold nights seen in the easternmost part of the Sea of ​​Sonia and the fog that shrouds the sea under the night.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fog, there is a dark, ancient spire church, a crow hovering over it, like a memorial, like a mourning, and the church is surrounded by ordinary houses, simple wooden houses, gray mills and shadows. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, this foggy scene, which is closely related to the night and the dream, should be formed by the breath of the goddess or the devil's wolf Fregra. But there is nothing in common with the presentation of the corresponding kingdom of God... Well, mortals can't spy on the gods, maybe the dark plains full of flowers and grass just not the projection of the kingdom of God, but the product of the ritual... Klein sees The moon mass has come to the end, and the palm is stretched out into the inner pocket of the garment and the wallet is taken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds the wallet, gets up and enters the aisle, all the way to the altar, in the merciful and compassionate expression of the Archbishop Electra, slanting to the dedication box before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the chest clockwise four times, after drawing the blushing month, Klein cast all the big money into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of £300! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Klein was not as painful and sad as he was a few times ago, and he was very calm because he remembered the ceremony of returning money from Old Neil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, under the blessing of the goddess, they found a wallet with more than three hundred pounds of cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step back, once again painted a blushing month, he gave the position to the donor behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Archbishop Electra took the initiative to welcome him and said that he clocked the red moon and said:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May the goddess protect you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the goddess know that what I want most now is to listen to the teachings." Klein smiles. Respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Electra looked at the exit of the side of the prayer hall:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you I don't mind waiting for a quarter of an hour, I can tell you in the library."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly what I longed for." Klein gently smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop Electra immediately led a pastor to lead Daun. The chief servant of Tangtes walked out of the big prayer hall from the side passage and went around to the spiral staircase. The library room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two large bookshelves here, which are filled with various books related to the Goddess of the Night, and some tables and chairs are arranged on both sides. For the pastor bishops to learn and use to the followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve minutes later, Bishop Electra entered the library with a calm smile and saw the white temperament of the corner. Tess is standing in front of a row of bookshelves and looking at a book intently, which is very scholarly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking at?" he asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed the book and laughed at himself: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Revelation of the Night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Frankly speaking, although I sincerely believe in the goddess, I have been busy with life for many years, and I have never calmed down to read this holy book seriously. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While speaking, he has no abnormalities on his surface, but his heart is a little embarrassed, afraid that the goddess directly gives a lightning to reward the devout believer Daun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, lightning is not in the realm of the goddess... Klein comforted himself in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Electra smiled and took the Apocalypse of the Night:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It’s not too late from now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately asked Dawn. Dontes to sit down at a table and systematically explain to the other party. The composition of The Book of Revelation of the Night and the key words in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richardson took the employer’s hat and cane, sat a little further away, waited quietly, and listened to the bishop’s sermon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, and the inspiration of Klein’s inspiration is striking, and the scene outside the mind naturally emerges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his intuitive premonition, stemming from the "clown", the intuition that has been strengthened by the fog! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the door, an old man with a black robe of clerics passed there, heading for a spiral staircase nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His white hair is still very dense, but there is nothing to comb, it seems quite messy, his face is thin, there is a feeling of skin directly wrapped in bones, the temperament is quite cold The skin is abnormally pale and the eyelids are rare and pure black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure quickly disappeared into the doorway, and the sound of footsteps gradually increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal caretaker! But it wasn't the one I met in the big prayer hall... Well, today is his turn? Klein focused on the bishop of Electra and put on a look at the content of the Holy Scriptures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He appeared inside the church at the time of the internal caretaker, and was not surprised by the library, because the seal power behind the Chanis door will reach at night. The heyday is no longer suitable for living creatures. Therefore, the internal caretakers are all entering the sunrise, leaving the sunset, and now the sky is completely black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember today is the number, week... Afterwards, gradually increase the corresponding information and find out the internal watcher’s rotation law so that you can play at the right time. The right goal... Klein retracted his thoughts, listened carefully, and got up and left after half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiles at the Electra Bishop:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if I still have Is this honor to hear you preach?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." In the face of the rich man who had given 300 pounds, Bishop Electra could not say the words of rejection. I’m even more willing to take the lead. “As long as you come to church, as long as I have time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t entangle the details, lest it lead to suspicion, sincerely Thanks, Richardson, a close-knit man, left the church of Saint-Saill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned home, less than 8 o'clock, just had dinner, leisurely spent the rest of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
