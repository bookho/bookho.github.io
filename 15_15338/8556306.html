			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such an instant, Emlin White is stiff and has no thoughts, like a marble statue sitting there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he heard the figure sitting in the fog in the light and calmly asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you praying to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin’s mind suddenly snorted and blurted out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This is the revelation of the ancestors. He tells us that He tells us through dreams that the end is coming, that we must be prepared, and that I, and I am one of several key points, my task is to 'fool' , pray to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the other side’s unremarkable detailed response, Klein, who is ready for follow-up, doesn’t know where to ask, he I want to know, this vampire of Emlin White has already been clearly stated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revelation of the ancestors... Did the ancient god Lilith not have fallen through the Second Age long before the Cataclysm, or was the authority regained by the Creator? Because of this, many vampires tried to pray to the "primitive moon" and ended up with a very miserable end... and, Mr. "Men" also mentioned that the "Moon" card is vacant, which indicates "original" The Moon is probably the embodiment of which god or high demonic. On the other hand, it also indirectly proves that the ancient god Lilith has lost the position of sequence 0. In general, this is often the same as death... Klein instantly associates with The clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally thought that "Lilith", which would respond to the blood clan in certain specific matters, is the relic of the ancient god, such as the "moon" approach. Uniqueness, so, dull, stiff, passive, and extremely restrictive, but now, the fact that the other party took the initiative to give revelation made him deny this speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two possibilities, one is which Lilith is pretending to be a god, preempting key points, blocking the desire to board the 'moon' route sequence 0 throne The opponents, in essence, do not care for the blood. The revelation provided is only a temptation. The most suspected one is the goddess who robbed the title of 'Lord of Redness', but He is already a sequence of 0. In the 'stars' card, why are you still licking the 'moon'? To destroy the enemy's good things?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second is that the ancient god died without being stiff, as long as there is nothing else The strongman becomes the sequence of the 'moon' route, and He can exist in a strange, incomprehensible way, waiting for the opportunity to return, as the 'Black Emperor' card describes, and the goddess will be 'blush The title of the Lord's is added to himself, perhaps to destroy the matter to some extent...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to this logic, Lilith recently made the last days Enlightenment is to save the resurrection efforts after many years, and I am this The person's role will play a key role in his prophecy. If this is the case, then it should be considered to some extent as a 'cooperation invitation'... but I am an extraordinary person of sequence 6, what is the ancient god who has not dissipated Cooperation?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let Emlin White join the Tarot? The blood race is a long race of life. From the second era to today, the secrets of knowing are certainly quite a few...just, that will take no small risk, um, you can divination before every meeting to pull Emlin... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, in the note of "Spiritual Insights," there is a similar doomsday prophecy from 'Huangguang' Veneto, who also pointed out The curse of the Abraham family will be lifted by an 'apprentice' who is helped by the hidden existence. This is in line with the current state of Miss 'Magician'. She is the 'apprentice' who got help from my 'fool'... It’s a bit interesting. Do all the high-ranking people who are good at prophecy see the inevitability of the end, and also see the existence and possible role of the 'fool'?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Klein's mind flashed a thought, but the expression did not change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned back on the chair and laughed slowly and slowly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your ancestors let What do you pray to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peaceful voice makes Emlin slow down from the stiffness to the state of what I am not doing. Shaking his head in a sluggish manner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Klein saw On the back of the chair where Mlin sat, the messy stars swiftly moved, quickly forming a symbol that symbolizes the "Red Moon". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the extraordinary path of the descendants of the ancient god Lilith pointed to the "moon"... Klein smiled aloud: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the presence of seven gods and many In the case of hidden existence, why do your ancestors think that I will be the key point of the end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of "fool" finally calms Emlin White Down, I realized that I really encountered an incredible event, and I was forced into a magical place by a hidden existence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the "fool"... He is not angry... Is this because I represent the first ancestor? I, Emlin White, is indeed a special one, mentioned by the first ancestor, and received the response of the "fool"... Emmanin couldn’t help but sit up straight and think about the language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, the revelation given by the ancestors is like this, I, Emlin White, will be the key to saving the blood, defeating the end, and this Everything starts with praying for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hidden meanings are:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key point of the last day Not you, it is me! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy has such a "Secondary" side... Also, he has always been arrogant, feeling good about himself... Klein used the past in his heart The popular vocabulary spit out two sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is quite funny to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same question, why is it to me, Instead of seven true gods or other hidden existences praying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I don't know." Emlin shook his head honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought for a moment and deliberately said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I probably understand the meaning of your first parents. He hopes that with my help, you will grow into a true high person and save the blood race in the last days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Growing?" Emlin doubts Tao, "You know, our blood family can't grow on their own. Only through special rituals to get the gifts of the elders and the legacy of the ancestors can we upgrade the ranks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, it must also be in accordance with the law of conservation of extraordinary characteristics... In other words, there must be other ways, as long as the basic laws are met... Klein laughs and laughs: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your insights blind your eyes, so that you can't see a wider world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Of course, this question won't be answered by me, it The answer must be found by yourself, I just offer you a chance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused for a second and looked down: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You hope to have this opportunity ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin did not hesitate to get up and salute:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is mine desire! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, in the face of hidden existence, where is your arrogance going, how is there only humility? Klein whispered, finger tapping the mottled long table Marginal Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you must obey some things. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You speak. "Emlin endured the excitement of her heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't Things related to me are disclosed to anyone unless I am allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This includes the blood group that was present at the time of the ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Em Lin is somewhat unacceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is very gentle and reluctant to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lilith should not let you afterwards Who is it to report to?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not even the content of prayer from the revelation, you can infer it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li...He calls the name of the ancestor... It sounds like an old friend... Emlin’s heart trembles and lowers his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's tone is not too undulating and laughs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a secret The transaction, so I responded after you left watching, the same, you don't need to report to Lilith, it will make some guys aware."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See Emlin nodded a bit, and Klein added another sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be the key to saving the blood, you must bear the corresponding thorns, for example, no Being understood, being filthy and contemptuous, can only carry a heavy mission in the dark, and move forward silently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This targeted speech suddenly makes Emlin White imagined the corresponding scene: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always because of the likes of the dolls being laughed at by the same family, lost into the harvest church, leaving shame Trace yourself, never being valued and optimistic by the elders, silently guarding the ethnic group in the corner, guarding everyone, not knowing...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emlin, who was touched by himself, responded reverently: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your willingness will go through the earth."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned back, the cloud was very light and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I acquiesced in the establishment of a secret gathering, just in Here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to join this party and find a way to save the blood? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing! "Emlin answered without hesitation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein satisfactorily nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Do you have other things you want to request? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlinton was delighted and said hurriedly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great 'fool' I want to ask you to help me to remove the psychological suggestion. This is the bishop of the Mother Earth Church..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know. Klein interrupted his description peacefully.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows...not a secret existence...Emlin’s head is low again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein chuckled a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can help you, but you are willing What is the price for this? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, he has a very strong vision, just found out that Emlin White White's body is black and the psychological hints do not know anything. The time has been dissipated, and it is thin to the extent of vulnerability.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein originally intended to solve the problem of dealing with similar problems in the Book of Secrets, but now The situation made him believe that a close ceremony and the suppression of the "Black Emperor" card and the purification of the "Sun Brooch" will completely dispel the psychological suggestion of Emlin White.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Cost? Emlin thought for a while but couldn’t figure out what he was interested in as a “fool”.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See here The situation, Klein took the initiative to say: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very interested in some of the history of your blood family, you can use this content to exchange. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History of the blood family? Emlino agreed to it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You can think about what you are going to describe first. Oh, before that, you need to choose a codename from them. "Klein has the unselected Tarot cards on the surface of the bronze table.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin White is very interesting to see carefully A few eyes: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
