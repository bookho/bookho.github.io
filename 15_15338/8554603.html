			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bakerland East, a crossroads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike Joseph saw a lot of poorly dressed children on the street, rubbed their mouths with a handkerchief and planned to give them some pennies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his actions were stopped by the former tramp old Kohler:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s a thief!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The thief? Their parents? Or is this controlled by the gangster?” As a senior reporter, Mike has never been to the Eastern District. However, it is also vaguely heard that there are several gangs that control the stray or begging of street children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Parents? They either have no parents, or their parents have been thieves, or are still doing it now. Of course, Mr. Reporter, you are right, among them. Many people are indeed controlled by gangsters. It is said that the gangsters will also teach them how to steal. For example, hanging a gentleman's coat on the wall, putting a handkerchief in his pocket, hanging a pocket watch outside, and practicing through repeated practice. Walking the handkerchief and the pocket watch does not appear shaking, oh, this is when I was a tramp, I heard people in the almshouse." Old Kohler said slyly, "I remember the smallest street I have ever seen." The thief, only six years old, hey, six years old..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to remember the child who lost his illness and couldn’t help but pull out his pocket The crumpled cigarette, but not willing to suck, just sniffing the smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Six years old..." Mike was shocked by this number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened quietly and sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the Eastern District." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and adjusted his mood:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s closer to the jungle, not "Human society."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our interviews should be treated as an adventure, both to understand the sites that avoid dangerous creatures, and to stay away from those that don't look right The little things that cause you too much harm, um, I mean the mosquitoes in the jungle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mike, if you exposed your face in front of those children The thickness of the wallet, even if you protect it well, without letting them steal, will encounter a destined robbery in the next adventure, if you dare to resist, perhaps the body floating in the Tsock River in the morning will "More."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Detective, you are right! So many people in the Eastern District, missing a few days every day, no one cares. . "Old Kohler agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike’s expression was calmly listened to, silent for a few seconds, and suddenly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.35 million."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Because of a cold, Kline’s nephew was obviously dumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike steps forward:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the preliminary statistics of the population of the Eastern District." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I know that there is actually more than this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So much? "Old Kohler was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he experienced the day and night in the Eastern District, he intuitively knew that there were many residents here, but he did not expect to be able to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is several times the population of Tingen City... Klein subconsciously compares the most familiar places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the crossroads a few steps away:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are we going next? Going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler looked up and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zange Party? Isn't this the gang of "no mind" that caused me the loss of 10,000 gold pounds? He is still a prisoner, I don’t remember his name... Fortunately, the 10,000 pounds eventually exchanged the recipes for Sequence 7, Sequence 6 and Sequence 5 of the Divination. "The Eye of All Black", in exchange for the life of Ambassador Intis... I don’t know which side of the manuscript of the third-generation difference machine was finally got... Klein recalled what happened last month. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Zimman Party? The gangster mainly composed of highlanders?" Mike asked thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Reporter, have you heard of them?" Old Kohler is a different way<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike is ok One voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are involved in a number of cases and have some reputation outside the Eastern District. It is said that members have been involved in an Intis spy case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Next to you is the party, the informant, the victim... Klein silently added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You decent gentlemen know the Zmanger party, why don't the police take them away?" Old Kohler asked the mind of the people at the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike’s expression suddenly became a bit ugly, coughing twice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who have done the case, the rest have no evidence, can not be arrested, and the Eastern District is so large, the population is so much, it really is difficult to find anyone who wants to hide."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is easy to destroy a Zimmergg party, but as long as there are plateau people coming Beckland, as long as they still retain the tradition of bravery and have not found any other way to make a living, the new Zimmergg party is only a matter of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This is a complex social problem... Klein pointed to the left and right sides:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pick one side."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler looks to the right side of the street:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is the Huili party active, as long as it doesn't provoke street and bar Do, um, the girl who does the business They won't be noticed by them, huh, huh, it's morning, there won't be any problems, they are still sleeping."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "Hui Li" is In the Lun language, it means "the lawless person". The gang who takes this name can be said to be quite self-aware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and Mike had no opinion on this, and under the guidance of the guide, they entered the block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building here is relatively good, the environment on the street is not so dirty, the air is filled with the oyster soup and the fried meat fish left by the street vendors. The taste of food and drink such as ginger beer and the astringency of fish and fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, Klein has an inexplicable familiarity, like returning to Tingen City, returning to Iron Cross Street and returning to the original residence. The street outside the apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference is that Beckland is closer to the sea and has more developed traffic. There are quite a lot of marine fish here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a good apartment nearby. I used to wander around several times and found that the gentleman and the lady inside were dressed, um, relatively clean. Old Kohler pointed to a pale yellow three-story building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three of them came together and found a sign hanging on the entrance of the apartment with a pocket watch, wall clock and screwdriver, and words such as "repairing clocks". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a watchmaker here?" Klein unearthed a similar scene from the memory fragments of the original Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, Benson, Melissa and he went to a similar place to repair the silver pocket watch left by his father, but the item was repaired several times, and They all quickly broke down until they were completely smashed by Melissa, becoming the most decent thing in Klein during that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should it be owned by Benson now? I don't know if he took out the pocket watch every time, would you think of me... Klein suddenly blinked and outlined his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be." Mike is not sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a problem with his pocket watch, it is usually sent to the original watch store, which is assigned to the subordinate's repairman or entrusted to the long-term cooperation of the craftsman. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the apartment, they saw a middle-aged man with a beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gentleman just came out of the bathroom and went back to the room. After discovering that three strangers came in, he asked a question:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to repair the clock?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s so fabulous... It’s a direct encounter with the craftsman... Klein is a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike took out his pocket watch and smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, my pocket watch has recently It’s time to go, you can help me take a look.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t reveal his identity and planned to do the interview in a casual chat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man suddenly smiled and led them into a two-bedroom half-room, pointing to the chair next to the wooden table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's wait, I'll take the tool."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your tool is not at home?" Mike Asked strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watchmaker shook his head and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A set of tools is very expensive, I can't afford it alone, I can only collect money, buy three or four sets, whoever has business, use it, so we move It’s a piece, huh, huh, it’s more convenient. If you’re too far apart, you have to spend extra time and the public carriage fee to borrow the tools.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said Going to the door, go to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no coincidence that we met watchmakers. Many of the residents here are watchmakers... Klein is amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kohler looked at the room and said enviously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before I fell ill, I also lived In this place, my wife will help people to mend clothes at home, two children, two children..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike sighs and sighs道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that watchmakers are very rich."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am also ..." Klein pinched his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a friendly exchange with several guests in the apartment, Klein et al People once again embarked on a journey of adventure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked a hundred meters and suddenly heard someone quarreling on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ladies screamed and greeted each other in a variety of indecent language, and let Klein learn a lot of words that had never been heard before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason they quarreled was that the woman on the left accused the right woman of making the environment of the apartment she was dirty and would make noise, right woman Then he rumored to the left and thought it was her own problem. No one asked her to solicit guests at night and sleep during the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a woman who washes?" Mike listened slightly, and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I know her, she is a widow, with her two daughters helping people wash clothes." Old Kohler made a positive answer . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
