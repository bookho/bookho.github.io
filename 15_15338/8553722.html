			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Fallen Creator"? "Sun" Dairik suddenly frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents of Silver City always believe in “the God who created everything, the omnipotent God”, after hearing the similar name being labeled as “fallen” It is inevitable that there will be rejection and incompatibility from instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Fallen Creator"... This is the name of "The True Creator" by Mr. "The Fool"... It turns out that this evil spirit has this image...but why Will his gods and temples appear in the exploration of Silver City? There is a suspected land for God! Or, before being abandoned by the gods, there is already a "real creator" belief... Is the aurora always claimed that the sanctuary is really in the land of God? "After hanging people" Alger thought of a lot of things, but could not make a definite judgment, because the history before the Cataclysm was early turned into myths and legends, which cannot be described simply by the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He indulged for two seconds, deliberately said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have another 'fallen creator' A name, 'real creator'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Faithfulness of his power to control the 'secret person', 'listener', 'hidden monk' is such an extraordinary way Followed by the 'Shepherd' you mentioned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shepherd"? The silent "sun" Dairik Huoran sat up straight, his eyes full of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is no stranger to the extraordinary approach mentioned in "downside down," but in some sequences, Silver City uses similar words, such as " Whisperers and listeners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original weird and sinister image represents the path of the "secret praying man"... Elder Lloydya is already a "shepherd"... The more uncomfortable... Dairik suddenly worried about the new elders of the six-member parliament and worried about the safety of the Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past exploration of the surrounding area, Baiyin City has discovered several cities that have been completely destroyed. In those places, there are only a few words of evidence behind the gravel. There used to be such a civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words belong to the variants of the Dragon, Giant, and Elvish, and most of them repeatedly describe a existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence is called:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crazy"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents of Silver City who are involved in the operation are speculating that those city-states were destroyed by the evil spirits, so the way to find the elders of Loyya is suspected to be a After the evil spirits are in control, how does the "Sun" Dairik not be shocked, not worried, not afraid? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He regained his taciturn and let the "justice" Audrey, who had been waiting to hear more about the story of Silver City, was disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—— After so many gatherings, her interest in Silver City has grown stronger after the last purchase of information about the Dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His reaction is a little different from what I imagined... "The man hanging down" Alger calmly observed for a while, but no additional gains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time, he could not find a better topic entry point, and if asked directly, he suspected that "the sun" would ask for compensation, which is on the burden For him, the debt of two extraordinary materials is not a simple matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, they also heard the sound of the table being gently tapped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein in the rich fog concealed exhaustion and whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time The end of the party is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your will is our will." "Justice" Audrey immediately got up, imagining the skirt, OK After a ceremony, "upside down people", "sun" and "world" successively answered in similar languages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein waved his hand and cut off the connection, quietly watching the blurry figure of Miss Justice and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he let the trumpet "World" disappear instantly, and he picked up the small badge study from Llanus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With this, you can join." Klein mourned the words behind the badge, but found that there was no change in the items in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it and carefully poured spirituality into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A layer of micro-beautiful blooms, quickly condensed into a beam of light, shot away from the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, it was bounced back by the boundless fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This speed of light hoars and turns into a palm-sized illusory parchment with a line of ancient Fossack:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"8pm on January 4th, 1350, Babel Valley."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple communication devices in the field of occultism? Send information, request synchronization, get the latest party time and location? Klein recalled the picture he had just seen and had a preliminary judgment on the role of the badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1350, that is next year... the Babel Valley is located in the area before the Tassok River entered Beckland... The time is very detailed, but the location is very Blur, it’s a valley of nearly a hundred kilometers... Maybe, when it’s there, this badge can also be used as a positioning tool...” Klein turned his hand over the badge with great interest, trying to figure out the corresponding symbols, spells and logos. See if you can imitate one yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, due to the departure from the night team, his occult knowledge is still at the original level and has not yet gained further learning opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after a few minutes of research, he can only helplessly give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the phrase "hold this thing, you can join", Klein’s intention is not to consider it for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can become a "no face" before the end of the year, I can pretend to go, otherwise I will... Klein silently said nothing, Attention turned to the promotion of the "magician". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true rhizome and juice of the fog tree people in the "Sun" should be stable... If the luck is not too bad, the spinal fluid of the evil-skinned black panther this week Can also start, sequence 7, the sequence, has been visible, touched ... ah ... " magician" how to play? Thinking about it, Klein began to consider specific issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the experience and experience before and after resurrection, he realized the true meaning of the "clown", so for more than a month, he only used it in daily life. If you keep playing, you can gradually digest it, and you don't need to summarize it separately. Then, according to the feedback correction, when you kill Lalhous, complete the initial revenge, and the tears in the smile, the "clown" potion will naturally be completely digested. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the same as Klein’s first process of digesting the "Divination" potion. It is a special case, and now, the "magician" plays Will return to the previous one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The true meaning of the magician, to the real thing? Well, according to the diary of the Emperor's diary, Charato, although the mainstream of this route is not fate, but after all, there is still a part It belongs to it, so, here, there must be corresponding content? For example, it seems to change fate to some extent, but in the end it is only an illusion, just magic, just cheating?" Klein licked the forehead and used the residual Spiritually wrapped itself and fell into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. George District, a two-bedroom house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I have prepared such a place extra, otherwise I don't know where to hide." Fols stared at the mirror and dialed his hair. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes..." Hugh in bed, answering with anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just read the newspaper and said that Lalhous is dead, but this matter involves divinity, certainly not so soon, we still have to I have been hiding for a while, the amount is wrong, it is you have to hide, not me, I am a straight clinic doctor, best-selling author!" Fols looked at the mirror and made simple makeup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no language response for a while, slow down and sit up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I am smart enough. I have a wealth of experience. When I was looking for someone to report, I didn’t directly say that the divinity involved in the 'real creator' was only described as seemingly dangerous, the goal changed a lot, there was a feeling of praying for evil spirits, etc. Otherwise, I I didn't dare to stay in Beckland. It was very hard and dangerous to get involved in the high-level struggle. I don't want to take the task of Miss Audrey again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
