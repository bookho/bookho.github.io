			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t say more, didn’t take charge of Daniz, pressed the top hat, carried the suitcase, went to the ramp, and stepped down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really let me go? "Flame" Daniz stood on the deck and looked suspicious. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he had expected such an outcome, from the port of Damir, Galman Sparo directly let him go, you can imagine today’s The scene, but still can't believe it, I think it's too easy and too easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, I am worth 3,000 gold pounds, no, this is just a unilateral reward for Lun! Is the mad man of Gilman Sparo not an adventurer? How can you let go of the huge wealth in front of you? I can't understand... Oh, normal people can't understand the madman... Daniz gradually returns to God, takes his luggage, carefully walks down the ramp and steps on the concrete floor of the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He straightened his back, raised his head, looked at the back of the German Sparrow, and found that the other side really did not look back, along the road, Go straight to Haiphong Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz did not dare to neglect, immediately turned around, left from another road, and sometimes turned and turned, and sometimes looked back with obstacles, so as not to be followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he came to the row of houses near the dock warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German Spalo did not really treat me as a bait... After watching it again and again, Daniz completely relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he felt that he finally got the understanding, and the sailor of the pirate generals no longer had to be oppressed, and he was called as a servant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been able to foresee that tomorrow will be very beautiful, there will be a group of guys vying to flatter me, want to be my servant! Daniz happily rang the door, three long and three short intervals, very rhythm. Br,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, He never thought that the contact point of our "Golden Dream" was at the dock... Daniz licked his nose and breathed the refreshing sea breeze before the rain fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Yam is the fulcrum of the colonial rule of the Kingdom of Luen in the Central and the Sea of ​​Sonia. It is one of the best cities in the region. There are many powerful and powerful officials. Extraordinary, no matter how arrogant the pirates do not dare to show up here in a bright and straightforward manner, most of the time relying on local gangsters or people with deep backgrounds to deal with stolen goods and purchase necessities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this does not mean that they will not come to Baiam. The "Red Theater" here is the most famous brothel on the sea, and countless pirates However, even if a pair of peers are arrested there, they will not hinder their succession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the spice trade, the brothel industry is another pillar of the Rosde Islands, except for the "Red Theatre", which is larger or smaller, or bright or hidden brothels. All, fully satisfying the hunger of the majestic men on the sea. As for the female pirates, don’t worry about this problem, as long as they are willing, they can be satisfied at any time. After all, there are many mouths to eat, less meat, and a wide belief storm. In the sea of ​​the Lord, the number of women has not been much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the extraordinary materials and occult-related underground transactions are also quite frequent here, with many circles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or those small ports are good, we are not afraid of being discovered, we can sit in the bar brightly and arguing with the opposite adventurers, even hit One, as long as it does not cause major events, does not make a life, the local official extraordinary will pretend not to see, oh, with their strength, really want to manage, often take a lot of risk... Daniz Half thought with ridicule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he heard the footsteps and saw the door slamming open, and the familiar face came into view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Old guy, didn't drink today?" Daniz said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing at the door is one of the contacts of the "Golden Dream" in the Rothde Islands, Old Lynn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Lynn coughed twice and let the road open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smelled the scent of "strong lyrics". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Old Lynn likes to drink the local "Beyam Heland"! When the thought flashed, Daniz was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he saw a person standing back to himself standing tall, tall, dark-skinned, muscular, and his hair curled like a marble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steel" Maviti! Daniz's pupils contracted sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second sergeant of "Senior", the 6,000-pound pirate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea breeze blew, the sharp leaves swayed, Falling at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walked on Haiphong Street, the pace was not fast or slow, and the passers-by around were in a hurry and rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spiritual instinct tells him that this rainstorm will take a while to fall, and he has enough time to find a hotel where he can stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is getting louder and louder, with branches falling and falling to the ground, there are few people left in the entire street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was about to turn into another alley and suddenly heard a quick but messy run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz is running hard, and the scene in front of him has shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that the wound is very painful, life is passing fast, the spirit has left the body halfway, close to the legendary underworld, so that the surrounding sound can only be blurred Hearing, everything in sight is not real enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is not a "shadow cloak", the ambush has just killed him, but even so, he suffered a very serious injury and may fall down at any time. Beside the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supporting him to run to Haiphong Street is sure to pass the information that the contact point was controlled by the "blood squad" to remind the captain Faith, and the hope of that crazy but powerful figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is him, he will surely be able to leave smoothly from the "steel" Maviti... The pace of Daniz begins to groan and his body gradually becomes chilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he felt that he couldn’t support it, he saw the Germanman Sparrow standing on the corner, the Sven but the ultimate The crazy face was so kind at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz fell on his back, and his hands on his chest and abdomen were unable to hang down, exposing a sly, exaggerated, visceral wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Told the captain, the old Lynn was discovered, 'Steel' Maviti, in order, for that treasure!" Daniz saw the German Spa Luo Hao came to the side and said in a desperate manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein recalled the amount of the reward for the "Steel" Maviti, and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the blood above?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, tell the captain, tell, tell the captain!" Daniz gasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished his heart, he showed a sad smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't care for me, I am fast I am dying.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell the captain, my money has become, and it has become a property, in Bayam Avenue, 12 On the 16th, the documents, the documents are hidden, hidden in the wall of the 13th basement, sold for me, sold for me, brought the money, brought to the south of the city of Nosie Give it to me, give it to my parents, say me, say me, really make a fortune..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me, say that I have become, an outstanding, excellent adventurer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And...say, say, sorry..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes suddenly wet, seemingly reminiscent of the rebellious teenager.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, old man , Mom, I didn't go home... Daniz was black in front of her eyes and felt that her life was coming to an end.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he saw German Sparrow reached out and pressed his own wound, and immediately went out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz’s sorrow was stuck, only the chest and abdomen were numb The pain suddenly disappeared, but the left hand seemed to be broken.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Klein dullly, Klein looked at him quietly, no one spoke for nearly two seconds Finally, he suddenly looked down and found that his fatal wound had been healed, his left arm was bloody, and his bones were spent.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nb Sp;&nbsp;I, I'm fine? Daniz blinked and immersed in the sorrow and frustration of the human being.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why No, first treatment? He asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked back at the other side of Haiphong Street, who had no one to say, and said in a tone:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is polite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Courtesy of your nephew! I was really telling the last words! Daniz leaned back and slammed and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was alert to the dock and saw a thick smoke rising up, which was the result of his recent fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the house was ignited by me, "Steel" Mavietti was afraid that the official extraordinary people would pay attention to this side and be confused by the shadow, so they could not chase it... Niz instantly understood the development of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First find a place to live." Klein spread his hand and caught a drop of rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz didn’t know if he was completely out of the crisis and nodded immediately:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Good.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the madman of Spal Sparrow is not afraid of "steel" Maviti, not even afraid of "blood on the top"... When I was a child, I especially appreciated his madness... I was exposed to my wealth... Daniz just vomited and his body suddenly froze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein carrying a suitcase and a cane, silently walking in front, only one thought in the heart is echoing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mom, it’s a pirate who has more money than me...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Queens District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey, who is leaving Beckland, is hiding in his own chemistry lab, using the fruit of the elders from Mr. Vampire, the blood of the mirror dragon, and Other materials collected previously, blended with the "psychologist" potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, she didn’t let Su Shi stay outside, but squatted inside, watching the process – Earl Hall has already confessed to everyone, not When the lady is doing the experiment, she is close, but she must always pay attention to whether there is any change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... Audrey sighed a little and poured the potted potion into the prepared glass bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly golden liquid swayed like a deformed, huge pupil, and the line of sight could shine into the pupils of everyone's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Su Shi, have you recorded the process? You are a mature, no, you are a mature extraordinary person, you have to learn to adjust your own potion later. No, I am not trying to help you, just pointing out a possibility, maybe sometimes, I am not by your side, and you just need a bottle of potion." Audrey said cheerfully to the Golden Retriever dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
