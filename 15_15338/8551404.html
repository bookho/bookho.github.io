			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord who created everything...the omnipotent God... Klein leaned back and kept a deep posture, repeating in the mind of the Silver City Boys’ Word Key words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is no stranger to the "creator of everything", "The Book of the Storm", "The Revelation of the Night" and the creator in the folklore A similar title, Aurora will be the same as the "real creator" that the secret organization believes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but "the omnipotent god", Klein is the first time in the world to hear, regardless of the goddess of the night, or the master of the storm, the god of steam and machinery, Did not claim that they are omnipotent and omnipotent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, if Silver City is really "the land of God's abandonment", "the land of God's abandonment" really belongs to this world, "the god of omnipotence" may be the ancient age The souls of those creatures who respected the Creator... Klein looked thoughtfully at the opposite boy, looking at his sad and painful mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick felt the gaze of the fool and couldn’t help but lower his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recalled the contents of the book and the legends told by his parents, saying slowly and sadly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the sun disappears from the sky, when the clouds are torn out of the gap, when lightning and thunder become the master, the monsters hidden in the darkness suddenly appear, they are such horror, that unimaginable, let the city of silver country One after another is destroyed... The 'deep darkness' of mankind is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The remnants of the strong gathered in the city of silver, relying on the power of unity And two magical items, finally resisting the 'Darkness' attack, and gradually clearing the area of ​​ordinary humans within a day, establishing a city-state that blesses the last glory of human civilization."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard textbooks... Klein couldn’t help but evaluate one in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The description of the other party always makes him feel that the area where Silver City is located and the North continent are not in a world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is the speciality of God's abandonment? He did not think in the slightest emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick sighed and continued:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the first few decades, Plants can't grow. Silver City is seriously lacking in food. It can only rely on hunting dark monsters with certain flesh and some mutated animals to fill the hunger. The population is beginning to fall quickly and uncontrollably. Fortunately, it has found 'black grass'. It can survive in this environment and become a reliable and stable source of food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is considered the last resort of the great gods Let the Silver City stick to it from generation to generation, and adhere to the 2,538 years in the 'deep dark age.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the ages At the time when the 'chief' was recorded, other Baiyin people were white when lightning was more, and the night when lightning subsided, and one day was alternating... Because this was often chaotic, we could not grasp the exact number of days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a peculiar place... Klein is fortunate Just do not take it for granted that day, but more vaguely described as the next two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric briefly talked about a few things worth remembering in the history of the Silver City, and instead said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the population has recovered to a certain extent, the number of extraordinary people has also increased. The 'six-member council' began organizing elite teams to explore the darkness. Recently, today, we have explored the original land. And the nearby city-states are marching toward the deeper and more terrible darkness. On the edge of it, we have found many cities that are strange but have suffered destruction. We suspect that this is the remaining baptism of other human beings. Regrettably, they are still swallowed up by the 'dark things.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "dark things" he describes should be hidden in the dark. , a variety of monsters that are unimaginable to normal people... Klein is invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The country of silver was once under the rule of the giant Wang Ting, so the extraordinary chain we mastered is the 'giant' approach, which we call 'God Blood Warrior' route... When we were killing some monsters, we gained some other sequence of potions when exploring the destroyed city, but the chain is not complete, with more or less Incomplete.” Dairik began to introduce the current situation of the Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard this, Klein was in a good spirit, and although his posture did not change, he was obviously more focused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My favorite thing to know about serial potions! Giant Wang Ting... The same history of Baiyincheng and the North Continent? History of the Second Age... Well, killing monsters will drop the recipe? Is this a game? No, there is a possibility that those monsters were once human beings and extraordinary ones... Klein suddenly felt a heavy feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick saw that the fool did not say that he bit his teeth and thought about it again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The name of the potion formula for the 'Giant' route is, in sequence, the sequence 9' Extraordinary Warrior', Sequence 8' Gladiator', Sequence 7' Weapon Master', Sequence 6 'Dawn Knight', Sequence 5' Guardian', and Sequence 4 'Hunter', the name of the higher sequence is only known to the elders of the 'six-members' group."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sequence 4 "Hunter"... ...this is the name of the high sequence potion recipe? This is the first time I know something similar! Klein feels gratified that he has mastered the title of a high-ranking strongman, but he suspects that this is an ancient name, which is different from the current description of the North Continent, like the "Storm of the Storm" and the "Navigator". The difference is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, extraordinary warriors, gladiators, weapons masters... a little familiar... Yes, the complete sequence mastered by the God of War is very similar to this! Sequence 9 "Warrior", Sequence 8 "Fighting Home", Sequence 7 "Weapons Master"! Because of the issue of confidentiality, Klein only knows the names of the first three recipes in the complete sequence of the Ares Church, but this does not prevent him from equating the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the core point of view, basically the same... The complete sequence mastered by the God of War is originally the so-called "giant" approach... This is said to be in the Third Age, That is, the gods that emerged in the catastrophe era inherited the legacy of the giant Wang Ting? Or is he himself an ancient giant? While doing analysis and judgment, Klein kept his eyes on the "light". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick introduced:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After the initial hardship, Silver City has been Reigned by the 'six-member parliamentary group', the elders who are in the highest position are revered as 'chief', and the remaining five are regardless of the level... The current 'six-person ritual group' consists of three 'hunter-hunters', Two of the most promising 'guardians' and one 'shepherd'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scratch, Silver City has three high-ranking strong! The half-god and the half-powered! This alone can be used to kill Tarot hundreds of times... Klein heard a guilty conscience, he has not tried to "pull people" under the eyes of high-sequence strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, considering that the opposite teenager is still just an ordinary person, even the sequence 9 is not, for a long time, it will certainly not be the attention of the high-ranking person, he put down Heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shepherd", is this in another sequence? The incomplete sequence... sounds like the style of the "Aurora", the one who wrote the letter to Mr. Z, the member of the "Aurora" who forgot the name, has been mentioning "The Lamb of the Lord" ... Klein maintains a laid-back attitude and asks like a casual question: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shepherd?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, this is the sequence we found in the cities that were destroyed by the 'Darkness', only to the sequence 5' Shepherd', but the Lloydya elders are very powerful and very strange. It is terrible. It is said that it has been against the evil spirits of high sequence level and has not been injured. Therefore, after the vacancy in the 'six-members' seat, she made an exception to become an elder.” Dairik replied with some fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it and smiled and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The front of the 'Shepherd' What is the sequence? I am familiar with this, you know, the name in history and the name of the modern will always be different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the city of silver, The name of the potion has never changed.” Dairik instinctively refuted one sentence, then bowed his head, “Sequence 9 ' secret clerk'...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ! Klein was satisfied with his own conjecture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sequence name of the "Aurora" sequence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 8 'whisperer', sequence 7 'Hidden monk', sequence 6 'Rose Priest', sequence 5 'Shepherd'." Dairik The situation I knew was originally told. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whisperer, listener, almost...hey, I can learn more about the information of the nighttime Tingen branch... Klein is in a good mood Dairik continues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
