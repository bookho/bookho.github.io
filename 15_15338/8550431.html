			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have to complete a task independently to be a full member?" Klein snorted. "But we don't necessarily have a mission for a week, and it's not necessarily Simple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this mean that it takes me about a month or two to officially become a night servant in order to be promoted and raised...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil sniffs the smell of coffee and gives him a look:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just a ritual between the nights, After all, we stand at the forefront of confronting extraordinary dangers. We certainly don't want our teammates to be children who need to take care of them at all times. This does not affect your salary to get the full members, get the corresponding rights, and fulfill the necessary obligations."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was originally a ritual that was recognized by other nights... But, Mr. Neil, why do you want to emphasize that it does not affect my salary to get the full membership level... I have performance Is it so obvious? Klein touched his face and smiled and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Must be a mission of extraordinary character?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should have been like this, but you did perform quite well yesterday, cleverly killing an extraordinary person with at least a sequence of 8, I think Frye, Loyola should have already approved You, therefore, Dunn may only assign an ordinary task." Old Neil suddenly sighed, "The salary doubles, I will not encounter similar things in my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein laughed twice and took the initiative to mention the sequence of his own things:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Neil, you think' Does the divination's corresponding sequence 8 be 'clown' real?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, recalling the description on the confidential information is quite consistent:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A "professional" who is good at skill fighting...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't promise you, but I For this reason, it may be very big. First of all, it is consistent with the records on the data. It is characterized by agile movements and skill-type fighting. Secondly, there are similar situations in other sequence paths. You know the sequence corresponding to the 'sister'. What is it called?" Old Neil smiled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, there is no information on the church." Klein shook his head calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil screamed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I and the heart of the machine" The two old guys are acquaintances, they mentioned it in a joking tone. The sequence of the 8 potions corresponding to 'The Secret Man' is, the fighting scholar, you can't hear, the fighting scholar, the goddess, I don't like fighting at all. It doesn't fit the image of 'the sneak peek'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's understandable... 'The voyeur' is looking for the secret behind things, fighting is also something One," Klein thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, don't waste time, continue the occult course, you still have a lot of ritual magic to master, you must also really learn how to make spells and amulets "Old Neal got the coffee in his hand." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein sat down and arranged today's time in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Study mystery in the morning, read through various historical materials, submit reimbursement applications, use lunch, go to the shooting club to practice, then go to the Devils Library in the Golden Indus District to see if you can borrow the main peak of Honachs. Academic monographs and corresponding journals, after doing all this, if you still have time, go to the divination club to sit down, "play" can not have the slightest relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the application was approved, I received a set of formal clothes on the way home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, apply for materials tomorrow morning, try to make amulets to Melissa and Benson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chandelier with an elegantly decorated dining room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several friends are congratulating Joyce Mayer to escape the tragedy and return to Tingen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We all saw the newspaper, just the description of the text, it made people feel scared." A man with a short beard under his arm, said, "Joyce, it's hard to believe that you have experienced such a thing, suffered such a hardship, toast, the bad luck has gone, the sun is shining on us, the steam is on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce and his fiancée, Anna, toasted at the same time, touched friends, and then sipped a few of the remaining champagne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In these days, Anna is really worried. I suspect she is crying every night. When I invite her to have afternoon tea, she always walks away. Fortunately, you are finally back, otherwise I suspect she will die like this.” A young woman with brown hair looked at Anna, and said to Joyce, she had a small and cute nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Anna encounters something similar, I will be like this, even more dysfunctional." Joey's hooked nose looked at the fiancee next to him gently. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna is not used to showing emotions in front of others, looking at the other side of the long table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Boghda, why do you keep your head down, I feel that you are in a bad mood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lady with a small nose replaces the other The answer is: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bogda is sick, the doctor told him that his liver has a big problem, using drugs can only reduce the pain, can not really treat, A surgical operation is necessary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord, when is this?" Anna and Joyce asked in a strange and concerned way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bogda is a young man with a very short hair, his face is yellow, and the usual savvy red eyelids are also bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things last week, because Joyce has not returned, I let Irene not tell you." Bogda explained with a bitter smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce asked calmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did you consider the surgery?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bogda's expression changed a few times:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I haven't Make a decision, you know, those surgeons are simply butchers, the people who do the surgery are the pieces of meat on the cutting board, they are slaughtered at will! I have seen many reports, they even take an axe to help people amputate! Lord, I suspect that I will die on the operating table."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if you delay, maybe the surgery will not save you." The man with a short whisker persuaded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Anna suddenly interjected: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bogda, maybe you can consider To do a divination, if divination shows that everything is going well, then surgery as soon as possible, if the results of divination are not good, look for other ways, follow the tips of the diviner to find. I know a real, magical diviner, No, I should call him a diviner. I think he can definitely help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real?" Bogda with a clear skeptical look On the contrary, their other friends are similar attitudes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really." Anna nodded without hesitation. "I looked for his divination, the situation of Divination Joyce, and then he told me to go home." Your fiancé is waiting for you at home. I was like you at the time, my heart was full of doubts, but when I got home, I really saw Joyce, he really came back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, I can testify." Joyce echoed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t say that he came to the door to ask for a dream, because the police told him that Tries had not been caught, so he had to hide the secret so as not to retaliate. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord, this is simply unbelievable!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does divination really magical? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In amazement, Bogda contemplates:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I really should go to divination, Anna, Joyce, can you tell me the address and name of the diviner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Announced a sigh of relief:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
