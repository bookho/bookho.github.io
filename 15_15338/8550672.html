			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture begins to distort, begins to blur, and begins to disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein got out of that dreamlike experience, and the line of sight followed the darkness of the bedroom. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that his brother Benson used 1 pound and 10 sules, which is 30 sule’s weekly salary, and he and himself are equal to Melissa according to the standard of normal civilians. hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that the vast majority of workers can earn 20 Sule per week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listened to Melissa mentioning that in the down street of Iron Cross Street, some families of five, seven, and even ten people live in the same room. Inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows from Benson that in the past few months, influenced by the situation in the South China, the kingdom has experienced economic downturn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has learned that the miscellaneous maid who eats and drinks can take 3 Sule 6 pence a week to 6 Sule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein reached out and held his eyebrows, and for a long time did not speak until Sir Deville lie in bed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police officer, don't you say anything? The psychologist I asked before will chat with me in this environment at this time and ask questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"However, I did feel peace. I almost fell asleep just now, but I didn't hear any jealousy and crying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein leaned back on the rocking chair, and did not answer the question. The voice said gently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jazz, do you know lead poisoning? Do you know the dangers of lead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Devil in bed silenced for a few seconds Tao, "I didn't know it before, but later I learned that you mean, my psychological problems, or mental illness, because I feel embarrassed, I feel embarrassed about lead women workers and glazed women workers. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Klein's answer, he is as self-sufficient as he takes hold of the negotiating initiative:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I used to feel embarrassed, but I have already compensated them. In my lead factory and porcelain factory, every worker can get the same salary than the same place. A lot more, in Beckland, lead women workers, glazed women workers have a weekly salary of no more than 8 solers, and I pay them 10 sores, and even more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, many people accuse me of letting them lose their morality and it is difficult to recruit workers. If the Grains Act is abolished, many farmers will go bankrupt and enter the city, they will have to follow me to raise their salary." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I also told the factory’s supervisor that the workers who felt a lot of headaches and blurred visions left the place where they could get exposed to lead. If they were very ill, I can also apply for assistance from my charity fund."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, I have done it. Enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s tone did not waver in the slightest wave:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jazz, there At the time, you can never imagine a salary is important to a poor person. Even if they only lose one week or two, their families will have irreversible and tragic damage. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am curious, so rich Why don't you buy equipment that protects against dust and lead poisoning in the factory? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deville looked at the ceiling and smiled a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That would cost me It is too high to be accepted, and it is completely impossible to compete with other lead factories and porcelain factories. I am not too concerned about the benefits of this aspect, and even willing to subsidize some of the money, but always, what is the point? This can only help a small number of workers, can not become the industry standard, and drive them to make changes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will turn into me to spend money to raise people. I have heard that some factories are secretly using slaves in order to save costs. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein crossed his hands and stood silent for a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jazz, your psychological problems are coming from this point of accumulation, although you thought They have faded and have disappeared. There would have been no obvious effects on this, but something has irritated you, letting all the problems be ignited and all ignited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there something exciting for me? I don't know that there is such a thing." Deville said with doubt and affirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein let the body sway gently with the rocking chair, and the tone is gently explained:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You actually fell asleep for a few minutes and told me something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hypnosis treatment?" Deville habitually made a guess, pre Conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not respond positively and said directly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have seen it on the carriage A woman worker who died on the way to work, she died of lead poisoning and glazed your porcelain before life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Deville stunned The temples on both sides of the temple, whispered indefinitely. "It seems that there is such a thing... but I don't remember very well..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term insomnia His mental condition is very poor, and there seems to be a similar scene in the vagueness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it, no longer squeezing his poor brain, and instead asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the woman worker called?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I mean, what should I do to treat my psychological problems?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein succinctly and succinctly replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ; first, the woman worker who died on the side of the road called Hai Liye. Walker, this is what you told me, she is the most direct stimulation, so you need to find her parents and give more Compensation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second, widely publicize the dangers of lead in newspapers and magazines, and let your charity fund help the injured workers more if If you can become a member of the House of Lords, then promote legislation in this area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deville slowly sat up and laughed and laughed at himself:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Other things, I will go Do, but legislation, oh, I don’t think there is any possibility because there are foreign competitors. Legislation will only cause these industries in the kingdom to fall into a whole crisis. One bank after another, a large number of workers will be unemployed, and the poor organizations will be saved. Not so many people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned over and got out of bed, took care of the neckline, and looked at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hayley. Walker, right? I will immediately let Karen go to the porcelain factory to take her information, find her parents, police officer, trouble you and I wait, always evaluate me. Mental state."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein slowly stood up and took a police uniform on a black background. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 11 am, the first floor living room of the Deville home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who had never said anything, sat on a single couch, silently watching a man and a woman being brought in by the butler Karen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two guests have rough skin and wrinkles on their faces. The male's back is slightly awkward and there is a black sputum on the woman's eyelids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They basically match what Klein sees through Hayley, but they are older and more awkward, so thin that they can almost see the bones, worn out and worn, It is said that even the Iron Cross Street can't live down the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the inspiration of Klein, the cold wind began to swirl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pinched his eyebrows and turned his gaze to Sir Devil, seeing a white, transparent, distorted figure behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Morning, good morning, respect, respected Sir Alex." Haili Ye's parents are very rude and courteous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deville licked his forehead and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Hailey Ye. Walker Parents? Is she not a brother, a two-year-old sister?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hayley’s mother replied with fear: “She, her brother Some time ago, I broke my leg at the pier and broke my leg. We asked him to take care of his sister at home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deville silently sighed for a few seconds道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am deeply sympathetic to the misfortune of Hayley Ye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear In this sentence, Haili Ye’s father and mother suddenly turned red, and they opened their mouths and messed up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thank you, thank you for your kindness.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The police told us to tell us that Haili Ye died of lead poisoning. Should it be this word? Hey, my poor child, she only has At the age of seventeen, she has been very quiet and very stubborn. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You sent someone to see her and funded the cost of the burial. She was buried in the Raphael cemetery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deville saw Klein, changed his sitting position, leaned forward, and said with a heavy tone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s our negligence, I need to apologize.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I thought about it, I have to compensate you, compensate Hailey Ye, her weekly salary is 10 Sule Right? One year is 540 Sule, um, 27 pounds, we assume she can still work for at least 10 years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Karen, you take 300 pounds To Hayley's parents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "3,300 pounds?" Hailey's father and mother were shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most convenient time for them, the savings at hand did not exceed 1 pound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only they, the bodyguards and servants in the living room are shocked and envious, even if Sergeant Gate, can not help but make their breathing heavy - His weekly salary is only two pounds, and only one "V" police officer is only one pound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an indescribable silence, the housekeeper Karen came out of the study with a bulging bag in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called the bag, revealing a stack of banknotes inside, 1 pound, 5 pounds, but more 1 Soller and 5 Sule's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that Deville has exchanged "changes" from the bank in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the jazz's mind." Karen, who got the owner's approval, handed the bag to Hayley's parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helly’s father and mother took over and blinked and looked over and over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this, this is too generous, we should not accept it." They held the bag road tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deville Shen Sheng:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what Hayley Ye should have." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, you are a noble, benevolent jazz!" Hailey's parents excitedly and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a smile on their face, a smile that was difficult to contain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They praised Sir Deville over and over again, and they repeatedly said that there were only a few adjectives, and they repeatedly said that Hayley’s affirmation in heaven Will be grateful to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Karen, sent someone to send them back, um, first to the bank." Deville sighed and told the housekeeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helly’s father and mother clung to the bag and dared not stop to walk to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
