He is the gang leader of the Beckland Eastern District, who lives on loan-sharking loans. The cause of the incident is that a borrower finds interest several times higher than he expected. In the case, I found a small and famous "arbitrator" Hugh Dilcha, hoping she could convince the other party to waive the unreasonable part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman did not obey the "ruling" of Hugh Dilcha, and even threatened to take away the wife and children of the borrower that night, so Hugh Di Ercha changed the technique of persuasion, using physical means, and accidentally causing serious harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viscount of Glylint investigated the course of the incident, confirming that the description of Folls Wall was true and confirming that the gang leader lost control under the opponent. And after someone’s “visiting” in the middle of the night, the debt of the borrower was exempted, and the prosecutor’s statement was forgiven by Hugh Dilcha, but the case of serious injury was not that the victim would not be prosecuted if he did not want to pursue it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glylint hopes to solve it in a normal way, sending people to consult a familiar barrister, and the other party said that it is only a light sentence, but not guilty It is very difficult, unless the person can get a medical certificate with mental problems or imperfect mental development...” Audrey silently talked to her friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her, the most important thing is not to have a clear relationship with Folswall and Hugh Dilcha - after "Talo After this event, Audrey felt that she was no longer a girl who was innocent and ignorant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight, there is a dance at the Earl of Wolff, and then tell Glylint to do it according to the opinion of the barrister." Audrey Pico Nod and made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kingdom of Lun, lawyers are divided into barristers and solicitors, who are responsible for not having to go to court, for example, collecting evidence, talking to the parties, helping people The preparation of wills, supervision of property distribution and provision of legal advisory services, of course, they can also represent the parties at the initial level of the Magistrate’s Court to defend simple cases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the barrister is the lawyer who studies the evidence and defends the parties in court. According to the laws of the Kingdom of Ron, they must maintain an objective attitude, so they cannot directly Contact can only be done through assistants, that is, lawyers. Each of them is a true legal expert with outstanding eloquence and a high level of debate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restored the relaxed Audrey with the hidden darkness, peering into the bright gesture and looking at the colorful flowers outside, I thought of one thing:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Medical proof of mental problems or impaired mental development...Psychologist..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If psychological alchemy Will master the 'playing method', does that mean finding them in the psychologist community?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking of it, Audrey feels that her thinking is right The eyes are as bright as a gem. At this moment, she saw the golden-haired big dog Su Shi slipped into the back of the clumps of flowers with a sneak gesture, and slipped to the gardener. local. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Su Shi... What is it going to do?" Audrey hid in the shadows and looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden-haired big dog seems to be confused by the smell of flowers, not paying attention to the owner behind him, it opens his mouth and makes a sling like "Ah! "Yeah," the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it causes the surrounding air to vibrate, sounding a word that is not round enough:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey’s mouth opened a little, completely forgetting the etiquette of the elegant lady, she could not believe the scene she saw and the stiff voice she heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up and blurted out: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Su Shi, can you talk? You When will I speak?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden-haired big dog jumped up and turned to face the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It swayed its tail in a panic and quickly, and the mouth was closed several times before it oscillated the surrounding airways:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how to explain, after all, I am just a dog."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this sentence, Audrey was speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday morning, Klein on vacation reviewed and consolidated according to the scheduled plan I learned the mystery and then took the public carriage to Hoy University. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to get in touch with Mr. Azker to see what the other party knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the three-storey graystone building belonging to the history department, Klein chatted with the mentor Cohen Quentin for a while, exchanging the ancient ruins with the main peak of Hornachs Related things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no extra reward for his tutor to go to work, enter the diagonally opposite office, and walked to the left-handed Azick teacher desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Azick, can you talk to you?" He looked at the skin color bronze, soft facial features, and a small skull under his right ear. The faculty member took off his hat and took a gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown scorpion hides the indescribable sensation of Azick and organizes the book:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, let's go to the Hoy River."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein took his cane and followed the other side to leave the three layers of graystone. Small building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, both of them remained silent, and no one spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the flowing river greets you, when there are no more teachers and students around, Azkton stays in the footsteps, half-turning, facing Klein道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have anything to do with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sinks for a long time, thinks There are many euphemistic ways, but they all give up one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he asked quite frankly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Azick, you are A trustworthy, respectable gentleman, I want to know what you saw from me, or what do you know? I mean the last thing, you said that my destiny is inconsistent. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azke clicked on his cane and sighed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't expect You will be so direct that I don't know what to answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frankly, the place where your destiny is uncoordinated is the only thing I can see. Things, other than that, I don't know more than you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein hesitated and asked:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can you see it? I don't believe it stems from divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azk looks at the Hoy River sideways. The tone is a bit bleak:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Klein, you don't understand, divination can do this, just need to see who is divining. Of course, my divination is just an excuse to cover up."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...some people are always special, born with some strange abilities, and I should be such a person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should?" Klein keenly grasped The question of the other party's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I don't know if I am born, maybe the cost of that ability is to forget myself, forget the past, forget my parents." Azick's Twilight looked at the river with a slight sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you listen to Klein, the more confused:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forget the past?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick smiled without a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before entering the history department at Beckland University, I lost most of my memory, just remembering my name and basic knowledge. Fortunately, I have proof of identity, otherwise I can only become a tramp. For many years, I have searched my parents according to my identity, but There is no gain, even if I can see the corner of fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And in the years of college, I gradually discovered that I have some strange abilities, super The ability of the common sense category."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened very carefully and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Mr. Azick, why are you having amnesia? No, I mean, do you have a reason for finding amnesia on the spot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suspects Az Mr. Ke is amnesia Member of school life, even in low status is not a member of the sequence - this is the corresponding "monster", had a "prophet", in order to legend-based mentoring secret organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azk shook his head heavily:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, as if I had a sleep, I forgot the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a cane and walked a few more steps and said as he walked:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After leaving Beckland, I started dreaming and dreamed of many strange things..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dream? I am good at solving dreams! Klein, who entered the professional field, immediately asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of dream?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Azick smirked with a low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many different dreams, sometimes I dream of the darkness of the mausoleum, dreaming of a The ancient coffin, the body inside is squatting, and there is a white feather on the back. Sometimes, I dreamt that I was a knight wearing full armor, carrying a three-meter rifle and rushing to the enemy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sometimes, I dreamed that I was a lord, had a rich manor, had a beautiful wife and three children, and sometimes I dreamed that I was The tramp, raining, walking on the muddy road, cold and hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sometimes, I dreamed that I had a daughter, and before that A few children have different daughters, she has soft black hair, likes to sit on my own swing, always ask me for candy, sometimes I dream of standing next to the gallows, coldly Looking at the corpse floating above..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to Azick’s proverb, Klein found that he could not interpret each other’s dreams because the symbols of different dreams were On the contrary, contradictory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azick regained sight, and the voice no longer fluttered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fenerbo in the South The kingdom of the earth believes in the goddess of the earth, and the church of the earth goddess preaches a concept that they believe that each life is a 'plant', taking the nutrients of the earth, slowly growing, prospering and decaying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the dying, these lives will fall into the earth and return to the mother's arms, and in the coming year, they will grow again, flowers will bloom, year after year, life is like this. "I am still alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sometimes, I am very willing to believe this statement, I believe that because of my own special, I can dream of the last life, and then I will Fragment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, he looked to Klein and sighed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
