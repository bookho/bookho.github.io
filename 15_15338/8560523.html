			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint-Saill's Church, in the Great Prayer Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop of the short black hair regained his gaze, no longer looking at the middle-aged gentleman in front of the dedication box, nor did he give birth to the idea of ​​talking in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, in front of the altar, he represents the church, under the watchful eye of the goddess, it is impossible to treat it enthusiastically because of who donated more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he remembered the other party’s pretty good looks and mature and refined temperament, and plans to meet if there is a chance to meet again later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When quietly watching the last banknote slide into the dedication box, Klein closed his eyes and turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing the evangelist, he deliberately looked at the clergyman and smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop returned with a sly smile and clocked four times on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not in a hurry to engage with relevant personnel, so that his actions are logical, there is no skeptical abruptness, he is sideways in a calm and splendid manner Let a believer return to the place where he was sitting along the aisle, take a hat and a cane, and walk out of the church step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, after listening to the evangelists or going to the dedication box to express their feelings, or to get up and leave, do not feel any problem, because this is not compulsive behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you love the donation, you won’t be throwing money into the box every time you come here, often depending on the family’s situation, one or two weeks. Once or twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civilian class is about a few pence at a time, the middle class is three to five sores, and the rich and nobles are no more than 100 in gold pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the general situation. When the "Day of the Night" is the annual holy day, that is, "Winter Day", the amount of a single contribution will swell a lot, money Ample civilians will choose two to three sores, about 5 pounds for the middle class, and those in the upper class will donate directly to the bishops and church charities, ranging from a few hundred pounds to several thousand pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——“Winter Day” refers to the longest day of the night and is considered to be the birthday of the “Goddess of the Night”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the church, Klein stood on the edge of the square outside, nothing happened I watched the flocks of white pigeons flying and circling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even bought some food in the hands of the surrounding hawkers, feeding the pigeons leisurely, and did not intend to read the newspaper advertisements himself, looking for suitable houses in the North District. Because this is the task of the butler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good butler who has lived in Beckland for many years should know the different nobles, different rich, and the top middle class who can help the Lord, living roughly In which neighborhoods, the destinations are selected accordingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interaction between neighbors is the first step for newcomers to enter the circle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether it is the Carlton Club, which is a Conservative Party, or the New Party’s Freedom Club, and the various active or retired military officers’ clubs that represent the military, There are enough weights of introducers to get in touch... Hey, the kingdom is now the so-called club politics.” Klein pulled back his thoughts and thought about what to do after the end of the act of feeding the pigeons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After careful thinking, he found that he really had nothing to do right away, because the plan was still on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he is going to enjoy an expensive but hearty lunch, which is both the behavior that Dawn Dontes should have and the curiosity of Klein himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few months at Beckland, he never had the courage to go to the most prestigious restaurants in this metropolis, always Choose one of your own restaurants, Craig Club Buffet Restaurant, Streetside Restaurant, and Jurgen Lawyer's Restaurant, or go to the East Side to settle breakfast or lunch in a seemingly greasy coffee shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Intis Serenzo restaurant, there is the most authentic Intis dish, huh, huh, many of the signature dishes are under the name of Russell, said to be from the emperor's court... and It is not like most restaurants in the same level. It only offers a few main dishes to choose from every day. The category is very rich...” Klein recalled the top restaurant information he had seen in newspapers and magazines before finally decided to see the emperor. Palace dish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped staying, stopped the carriage and went to the Intis Serenzo restaurant in the West End. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the door, Klein handed over his coat, hat, and cane to a red vest waiter and asked him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any space? I have not booked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The red vest waiter did not look strange, asked humbly, "Mr. Are you coming for the first time? Is it only one person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded calmly and smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are I lucky enough to introduce you to the most distinctive dishes and famous wines in our restaurant?" Red vest waiter While talking, lead customers to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is exactly what I need." Klein saw the walls that seemed to be reflecting gold through the ornately decorated door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, he seems to be in a vault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he noticed the oil paintings hanging on the wall, the marble statues placed in the right position, the gold objects inlaid or dotted in different places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please pay attention to your feet." The red vest waiter reminded me that Klein was sitting in the window, and the beautiful melody of the violin was passed from a distant band. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter took the menu and the wine list and looked at the introduction:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The most famous dishes here are the red 焖Daiya beef platoon, the black truffle porcini, the Intis foie gras, I mention one more, the raw material of foie gras comes from the Bonas farm in the Champagne province of Intis. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein listened to the waiter's introduction while browsing the menu written in Guvsak, and was caught by the price above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the main course, the appetizer, the dessert, etc., the waiter turned to explain the wine pairing, and finally said:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our champagne, red and white wines are all from the famous wineries in Champagne, and even contain the 1350 Orffir red wine, which is worth 126 pounds. If you buy, you can Take it away, you can also have it here, every time you have a drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126 pounds... I can ask for a good housekeeper...hehe... Klein smiled very gracefully: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your dishes and fine wines are excellent and difficult to choose."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red vest waiter smiled attentively:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can choose the chef recommended today, and our chef will match you with a pure A delicious Intis meal, it has 15 pounds, 10 pounds, 8 pounds three programs"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t want to choose one...Klein’s body is slightly by Laughter: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"15 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Red vest waiter put away Menu and wine list, go to the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a breath, slowly spit out, and looked at the front casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw a slightly familiar figure, a lady in an olive green dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is tall and in good proportions, wearing an old black bonnet, and the fine gauze hangs down to cover her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mysterious Queen", the eldest daughter of Russell the Great, Bernard Gustav! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not rush to regain his gaze, naturally moving his gaze to the side, Bernard 黛 seems to be undetected and disappeared into the stairway,<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did she appear here? By the way, the signature of this restaurant is the court dish of Russell the Great, oh, it is not the type of Chinese style I imagined. The Emperor should not cook. At most, the concept is elaborated. There is indeed cooking here... Well, behind the scenes. The owner is her? She is not wandering at sea, what does Beckland do, hasn't she already found the Grand Theft Auto "Black Emperor"? Klein sat quietly on his face, and there was one doubt after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, on the street, a carriage is heading for the cause Tis Serenzo restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a family of Allen Kreis sitting in the carriage, this well-known surgeon is a member of the Cragg Club, a friend of Sherlock Moriatti , once commissioned the big detective to deal with the Will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since his wife was pregnant, he felt that his luck had become quite good, his career was better every day, his income was more than January, and he was more successful recently. Completed the visceral surgery of Baron Sindras, received the appreciation of the new aristocrats, and invited them to a lunch at the Serenzo restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that the ice cream inside is very good." Allen smiled sadly at his wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife is a black-haired beauty, the belly is already very obvious, Wen Xiao smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am looking forward to Russell's court dish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen "hmm", looking out the window:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s coming soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice just fell, his wife licked his stomach and frowned: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It hurts a bit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the first time I’m doing my father’s Alan’s quick check. When he found the problem, his wife became more and more uncomfortable, and the child in the stomach seemed to be making trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, I still don't go, I want to go home and rest." Allen's wife offered to propose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen thought for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will accompany you back."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately told the close servant:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You get off here, go to the restaurant and represent me to Sindra Baron apologizes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the carriage began to return, Allen’s wife’s uncomfortable feelings were alleviated. After entering the house, everything was normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She screamed at her belly and said to her husband:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that he does not want to eat Ice cream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie! In the restaurant of Intis Selenzo, Klein, who had not let go of every food before, enjoyed the ice cream with distressed and satisfying taste. The nose was a little itchy on the way, and the paper was pulled out and sneezed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western District, in a dark house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fors, who has been promoted to "Astrologer", actively participates in various extraordinary gatherings and seeks to make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She currently owes £220, so she is suspected of being involved in illegal gambling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't afford even the necessary crystal ball... The thoughts are floating, and Fols suddenly hears a party member say:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
