			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked to accept the appointment before and when did I find someone to contact? If it wasn't for a day and wait for "The Snake of the Destiny" Will Unsetin to locate it, I can still be 24 hours in advance... This is called professional! Klein responded plainly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can choose not to listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat Pharmacist Dak Will's follow-up words were smashed back, and his face muscles moved: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein bluntly said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I received the news that Roy King was secretly arrested by the military and is currently being held in Inside the Governor's Office."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message received from Mirror Arrods... He silently added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really?" Dakwell couldn’t control it again, his eyes were round and he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slightly invisibly slammed the first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My source is reliable enough." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I can't confirm it..." Dirkwell hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it involves an important seal of the 'life school'," Klein said bluntly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat pharmacist suddenly started a shock, stepped back two steps, and looked around with vigilance, fearing that the words were heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can such a thing be said casually on the street? He knew that we were a life school. He knew that the old man was involved in an important seal... I only knew it when I was last contacted... Dakwell gradually believed in the information provided by the adventurer in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein swept the owl from the roof and fell on the shoulder of the fat pharmacist:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can pay for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't confirm it, it's impossible for you to say anything, I will believe anything..." Dakwell mouth hard Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he saw the eyes of the opposite adventurer becoming very cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat pharmacist shuddered and whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, barely Counting that you have completed the commission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He distressedly took out a lot of cash from the pocket of the country witch doctor’s robe, and it was 100 pounds. Give Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is an extraordinary person, his career is "pharmacist" plus "tamer". The improvement in physical fitness cannot be completely reflected in the frontal battle, and may not win. The ordinary person who holds the revolver, and the domesticated extraordinary pet, is also a guy who has no fighting power. On the opposite side, it is an adventurer with many experienced channels. The probability is also extraordinary. One person and one owl may not be the opponent. Only the other party can say what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so hard to swear money... He lamented in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing "pharmacists" is indeed very profitable, especially in overseas colonies. There are many pirates, sailors and adventurers here, people are mixed, and the official organization is more relaxed. He can sell some illegal drugs without worrying about who is coming to the door. Those who are only in the Red Theatre, the business he provided to him in the last two months has earned him more money than the previous year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as an extraordinary person, his expenses are huge. The previous savings have been consumed by the promotion of the "tamer" and later raised. Only pets, hard to help buy formulas, tune potions, and buy self-defense spells and other items for themselves, the amount of money that can really be smashed is a few hundred pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took over the cash and borrowed the opportunity to verify the authenticity before they got into the pocket and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's too dangerous here..." "It's too dangerous..." "You must leave as soon as possible!" He whispered back into the herbal medicine store, entered the room, pulled out the brown suitcase, and quickly stuffed into various clothes and Folded neatly in cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he dumped the small banknotes in the change box and the copper pennies of different currency values, broke into the pockets, and took the identity documents purchased at a high price. Carrying the brown suitcase, walked out of the folk herbal medicine shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking back at the various pharmaceutical materials that have not been sold out, Dakwell’s chubby face was obviously twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a breath and endured the pain to lock the door, went straight to the alley, stopped the rental carriage, and went to the Bayam passenger ticket company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too dangerous, too dangerous, the old man was caught..." "Caught..." He sat in the carriage, repeatedly and silently Self-speaking, a little shivering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this state, he finally came to the ticketing company. Just after paying the fare, he rushed into the hall and rushed to the East Bay. The front of the passenger ship window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suck, call...suck, call...Dakwell even took a deep breath, followed by the ticket holders lined up in front, moving step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buy the nearest boat." He emphasized it to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dirkwell gradually quieted down during the pause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expression was distorted, and he quickly calmed down, twisted again, and calmed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When there was only one ticket holder in front of him, Dakwell’s footsteps were deadlocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid! You stupid!" He said, slamming his body, carrying his suitcase, holding identification documents, and getting out. Ticketing hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein doesn’t care how fat pharmacist Dackwell can save His teacher Roy Kim, he thinks this is not something he should consider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are behind the 'life school', even if there has been a recent split, it is also an ancient organization with hundreds of thousands of years of history, born in the early fifth century. With a deep foundation, the fat pharmacist naturally finds someone to help... If the 'life school' doesn't work, I will use the whole Tarot to move out, it doesn't matter, I don't need to worry about it, the military has a demigod in Baiyam. Half-man... Of course, he may not be in the Governor’s Office, maybe in a military base.” Klein in the carriage pulled out the wallet and looked at the thousand paper cranes inside, considering whether to throw it away immediately. Back above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait a second, maybe Weier Anthony’s “The Snake of Destiny” will give me any benefit... I will remember to prepare the pencil next time. Ignore this question, how big a paper crane can be, and there is no place to write intelligence with a pen... Then I can't take the initiative to contact Will. And I can only wait passively, and I can't always keep this. The paper crane is placed on the body. In a few days, it has to be sent back to the heap of debris on the fog. After all, I can't always let Will Anthony locate me. Be careful... Klein quickly makes a decision. Go to the "Azure Wind", pack your bags and return the luxury suite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying to him that when Daniz came over for the second time, he had a prepaid part of the room rate, and he only had 5 sores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Klein changed to the block and went to Ottom Street near the Fragrant Leaf Bar, where he lived in a hotel called "Tiana". A clean but ordinary room - just 2 sules per day for 2 pence, plus an extra juice from the giant fruit "Tiana". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking a sweet, milky juice, Klein didn’t need to take care of the image, he got into the easy chair in the room and decided to spend time with daze and sleep. For the next two hours, then go to the fog to see the prayers of the believers and experience the feelings of thousands of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, White House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin looked at the blood-red "gem" that appeared in the altar as if he heard his blood resonate with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just need to prepare the corresponding inheritance ceremony or auxiliary potion material, I can become a baron, and this is not difficult, at the current stage." Emlin is full of expectation and triumphant thinking, "according to The human system, by then I am an extraordinary person of sequence 6, the corresponding title is, 'potion professor'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, on Monday, in the foggy sea, a fleet is crossing a thin mist and a blue ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flagship of theirs is a huge sailboat with a unique banner hanging on it, depicting an eye that surrounds ten stars and has no eyelashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The star above the galactic" was standing by the window of the captain's room, quietly watching the misty sunlight until the wall clock on the wall The sound of the cuckoo valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She glanced at the time and quickly converted it to Lun, then pulled the curtains and sat down at the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table made of red wood is placed with a brass sextant and a light blue planetarium. The latter has large pieces on the surface. The blank is an area that has not yet been explored or explored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giddria extended his fingers and fiddled with the planet, then closed his eyes halfway and waited for the fool's call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for her to have a deep red glow in front of her eyes, completely drowning her already prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she adapts to change, there is another sacred palace supported by the pillars in the line of sight, and there is a mottled ancient bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light and lively greetings of Miss Justice, Jia Delia also paid tribute to the "fool" who was still shrouded in the gray mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes are simply swept away, her slightly dark purple eyelids contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found that the opposite side of the "upside down", "the moon" and "the sun" have a slight spiritual spillover, which is completely different from the last time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that they have all been promoted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows their promotion in the last few days! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In just one week, all three members of the Tarot Club were promoted, and the 'downside down' and 'moon' may even reach the sequence of 6... This is Coincidence? Just happened to be taking the potion this week? Probably, it is possible that the materials from the last 'Moon' and 'Sun' can be proved, but this is enough to illustrate the promotion of Tarot members. It's very fast, otherwise it's impossible to happen...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, under the sequence of 5, you can accurately grasp the extraordinary people who play the game without resources, and promote quickly. Not surprisingly... Sequence 6 to Sequence 5 begins, there must be ritual assistance, digestion becomes more difficult, and it is difficult to have similar things happen..." "The Hidden" Jia Delia regained his sight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, "Justice" Audrey apologized to Mr. "The Fool" and said that he had not contacted the members of the "Psychological Alchemy Association" recently and could not provide Russell's diary, as well as " The magician "Falth, her teacher's recent reply is always slow, and the cold weather makes her not I want to go out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik is because he has just been promoted, there are many things to deal with, and he has not been able to get new ancient mythological materials, "Folly" Ryan can only calm the behead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyric saw it, relieved and turned to look at the bottom of the bronze long table:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. 'World', I got the way you want to separate the extraordinary pollution from the out-of-controller's mental pollution. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't say it directly... The "fool" Klein at the top of the bronze long table is almost sluggish.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the little "Sun" you have already let the "Mr. Justice" and "Down Hang" people know about this thing in the previous promises, but the "hidden" lady is not just joining? Klein forbearance Lived the urge to lick your face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
