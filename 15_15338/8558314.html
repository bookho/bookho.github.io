			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked to accept the appointment before and when did I find someone to contact? If it wasn't for a day and wait for "The Snake of the Destiny" Will Unsetin to locate it, I can still be 24 hours in advance... This is called professional! Klein responded plainly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can choose not to listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat Pharmacist Dak Will's follow-up words were smashed back, and his face muscles moved: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein bluntly said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I received the news that Roy King was secretly arrested by the military and is currently being held in Inside the Governor's Office."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message received from Mirror Arrods... He silently added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really?" Dakwell couldn’t control it again, his eyes were round and he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slightly invisibly slammed the first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My source is reliable enough." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I can't confirm it..." Dirkwell hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it involves an important seal of the 'life school'," Klein said bluntly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat pharmacist suddenly started a shock, stepped back two steps, and looked around with vigilance, fearing that the words were heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can such a thing be said casually on the street? He knew that we were a life school. He knew that the old man was involved in an important seal... I only knew it when I was last contacted... Dakwell gradually believed in the information provided by the adventurer in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein swept the owl from the roof and fell on the shoulder of the fat pharmacist:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can pay for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't confirm it, it's impossible for you to say anything, I will believe anything..." Dakwell mouth hard Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he saw the eyes of the opposite adventurer becoming very cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat pharmacist shuddered and whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, barely Counting that you have completed the commission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He distressedly took out a lot of cash from the pocket of the country witch doctor’s robe, and it was 100 pounds. Give Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is an extraordinary person, his career is "pharmacist" plus "tamer". The improvement in physical fitness cannot be completely reflected in the frontal battle, and may not win. The ordinary person who holds the revolver, and the domesticated extraordinary pet, is also a guy who has no fighting power. On the opposite side, it is an adventurer with many experienced channels. The probability is also extraordinary. One person and one owl may not be the opponent. Only the other party can say what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so hard to swear money... He lamented in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing "pharmacists" is indeed very profitable, especially in overseas colonies. There are many pirates, sailors and adventurers here, people are mixed, and the official organization is more relaxed. He can sell some illegal drugs without worrying about who is coming to the door. Those who are only in the Red Theatre, the business he provided to him in the last two months has earned him more money than the previous year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as an extraordinary person, his expenses are huge. The previous savings have been consumed by the promotion of the "tamer" and later raised. Only pets, hard to help buy formulas, tune potions, and buy self-defense spells and other items for themselves, the amount of money that can really be smashed is a few hundred pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took over the cash and borrowed the opportunity to verify the authenticity before they got into the pocket and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his back disappeared into the alley, the fat pharmacist Dakwell’s expression sank instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's too dangerous here..." "It's too dangerous..." "You must leave as soon as possible!" He whispered back into the herbal medicine store, entered the room, pulled out the brown suitcase, and quickly stuffed into various clothes and Folded neatly in cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he dumped the small banknotes in the change box and the copper pennies of different currency values, broke into the pockets, and took the identity documents purchased at a high price. Carrying the brown suitcase, walked out of the folk herbal medicine shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking back at the various pharmaceutical materials that have not been sold out, Dakwell’s chubby face was obviously twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a breath and endured the pain to lock the door, went straight to the alley, stopped the rental carriage, and went to the Bayam passenger ticket company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too dangerous, too dangerous, the old man was caught..." "Caught..." He sat in the carriage, repeatedly and silently Self-speaking, a little shivering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this state, he finally came to the ticketing company. Just after paying the fare, he rushed into the hall and rushed to the East Bay. The front of the passenger ship window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suck, call...suck, call...Dakwell even took a deep breath, followed by the ticket holders lined up in front, moving step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buy the nearest boat." He emphasized it to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dirkwell gradually quieted down during the pause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expression was distorted, and he quickly calmed down, twisted again, and calmed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When there was only one ticket holder in front of him, Dakwell’s footsteps were deadlocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid! You stupid!" He said, slamming his body, carrying his suitcase, holding identification documents, and getting out. Ticketing hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein doesn’t care how fat pharmacist Dackwell can save His teacher Roy Kim, he thinks this is not something he should consider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are behind the 'life school', even if there has been a recent split, it is also an ancient organization with hundreds of thousands of years of history, born in the early fifth century. With a deep foundation, the fat pharmacist naturally finds someone to help... If the 'life school' doesn't work, I will use the whole Tarot to move out, it doesn't matter, I don't need to worry about it, the military has a demigod in Baiyam. Half-man... Of course, he may not be in the Governor’s Office, maybe in a military base.” Klein in the carriage pulled out the wallet and looked at the thousand paper cranes inside, considering whether to throw it away immediately. Back above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait a second, maybe Weier Anthony’s “The Snake of Destiny” will give me any benefit... I will remember to prepare the pencil next time. Ignore this question, how big a paper crane can be, and there is no place to write intelligence with a pen... Then I can't take the initiative to contact Will. And I can only wait passively, and I can't always keep this. The paper crane is placed on the body. In a few days, it has to be sent back to the heap of debris on the fog. After all, I can't always let Will Anthony locate me. Be careful... Klein quickly makes a decision. Go to the "Azure Wind", pack your bags and return the luxury suite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying to him that when Daniz came over for the second time, he had a prepaid part of the room rate, and he only had 5 sores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Klein changed to the block and went to Ottom Street near the Fragrant Leaf Bar, where he lived in a hotel called "Tiana". A clean but ordinary room - just 2 sules per day for 2 pence, plus an extra juice from the giant fruit "Tiana". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking a sweet, milky juice, Klein didn’t need to take care of the image, he got into the easy chair in the room and decided to spend time with daze and sleep. For the next two hours, then go to the fog to see the prayers of the believers and experience the feelings of thousands of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, White House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin looked at the blood-red "gem" that appeared in the altar as if he heard his blood resonate with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to Mr. "The Fool", he picked up the jewel and sensed the hooliganism inside, convinced that this is the relic of a bloody baron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
