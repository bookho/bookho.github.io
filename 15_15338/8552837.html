			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A living man and a dozen dead bodies playing poker for half a night in a dimly lit room, the scene makes people think more and more horrible, scalp One inch inch numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein curbs the fear that stems from instinct, looks pale in front of him, and the brown scorpion contains a lot of maliciousness, and the whole person reveals a little madness. Eighty-nine-year-old man, pretending to be stunned by the other's momentum, took a step back, and Casper left the card room and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man asked in a low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you looking for a bodyguard?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes." Klein deliberately swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person's surprise both made him afraid and gave him a certain peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stronger the bodyguard, the safer he is! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale black vest man lifts his chin:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you looking for a bodyguard? You How much will you be willing to pay for it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t answer immediately, thinking for a few tens of seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I will tell you the specifics of the task first. After you evaluate it, give me a price. If I can pay it, or have the equivalent item, then the transaction will be reached. In the opposite case, I can only give up. , looking for someone else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man with a gaze is not open, gently beheading, telling Klein to tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein deliberately looked at the living bodies, treating them as normal players, and asking with their eyes, "Would you like to drive those guys out of the room before answering?" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said the pale-faced man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein considered it and said it truthfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I offended a big man, behind There may be a big man supported by the state."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The card room suddenly has no movement, completely silent, and the man with a slightly malicious madness is stiff. In situ, it seems to have turned into a plaster statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly a minute, he slowly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This task is priceless." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啊? Klein didn't react to it for the first time, until the other person turned to the table, he realized that the deal could not be reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are playing a bunch of living corpses playing cards in the room. The performance is very high and the strength is very strong. As a result, you are scared off? You are obviously crazy... Klein doesn't know whether to cry or smile: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The big man is not so free in Beckland." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black vest man ignored him and sat down again. The living corpses began to deal with cards and throw chips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein breathed out and left the room, seeing Kaspas. Kanlining, a half-bone man with rosacea and sputum wounds waiting outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was no deal." Klein spread his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspars did not present amazed emotions, sinking for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He The price is too high?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, he thinks the task is too difficult." Klein did not hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspars brows micro-motion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maric is the person I know The most terrible one, he is not even afraid of bullets. Since he thinks the task is difficult, I don't think I can help you to contact other powerful guys."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately," Klein sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspars clenched his right fist and hit the left chest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The storm is with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I am dead... Klein laughs bitterly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can try to help me ask the powerful guys in other places, I will pay you a certain amount of compensation, um ... I will come again tomorrow night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving a positive answer, he left the brave bar slightly, not even interested in playing a game of billiards. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it too honest? If the commission is described as simple, Maric should have agreed... just don't know how much he will ask for... Hey, let others face the danger in the case of being concealed. This is not my style... As an extraordinary person, if you always violate the inner real thoughts and your own principles, I am afraid that the distance is out of control is not far away... Klein is half-baked and transferred to the carriage and returned to Minsk Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wash is finished, Klein does not waste charcoal, enters the bedroom directly, and draws Curtains keep the room from the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way back, he thought for a while and found that the dangers that might arise were not resolved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the unknown ambassador, his main and most fundamental purpose is to find Ian Wright, the reason why he sent someone to deal with me is Because I want to get Ian's clues, I can't get the answer if I can't get the answer. If I can let him know that I can't find Ian, he can't do it under the supervision of the special department of the military. A thug adventure...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, my appearance, I surpassed his expected strength, let their actions be exposed, suffered serious setbacks, replaced I am the ambassador, and I will definitely think about revenge for venting anger, but it is definitely not now, not the current situation of turbulence.... Well, the premise is that the ambassador has a brain, not just relying on relationships to know only anger. The straw bag... can let him preside over such an important thing, indicating that he should still be more reliable...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the crux of the problem lies in Ian Wright The whereabouts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm... There is still a hidden danger. After the ambassador finally fails, will he deliberately disclose to the military special department that Mersor is an extraordinary person? Let them know that my strength is doubtful, and use their hands to retaliate against me... This is just a slumber, no difficulty, you must beware...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein analysis Clearly aware of his situation, suddenly there is the urge to buy the murderer to kill the unknown ambassador. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thinking about the strong sequence that may exist around him, he is frustrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if the messenger can accept my assignment without the consent of Mr. Azick... It shouldn't work... pay close attention to this matter, Looking for an opportunity to destroy the mouth? Since he sent someone to kill me, I will not have a psychological burden to kill him... Yes, you can consider issuing this task at the Tarot Conference, see Mr. 'Justice' and Mr. There is no way... Maybe, I can spend a lot of money to move Mr. A or the stronger of the same sequence..." Klein suddenly flashed his light and thought of "Tarot." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mind, he settled a lot, flipped through the paper and pen, and wrote the divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ian Wright's whereabouts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After confirming that there were no hidden extraordinary people in the room, Klein looked at the outside Spying on the curtains, while recalling Ian’s appearance, meditating on the divination statement and leaning back against the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly entered the dream, and saw a dark, narrow, dirty room in the illusory world, with high and low beds and floor tiles. Sleeped four people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian is at the top of the bed, curling up his body, pressing the old bag and sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream is broken, Klein opens his eyes and interprets the revelation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
