			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A living man and a dozen dead bodies playing poker for half a night in a dimly lit room, the scene makes people think more and more horrible, scalp One inch inch numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein curbs the fear that stems from instinct, looks pale in front of him, and the brown scorpion contains a lot of maliciousness, and the whole person reveals a little madness. Eighty-nine-year-old man, pretending to be stunned by the other's momentum, took a step back, and Casper left the card room and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man asked in a low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you looking for a bodyguard?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes." Klein deliberately swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person's surprise both made him afraid and gave him a certain peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stronger the bodyguard, the safer he is! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale black vest man lifts his chin:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you looking for a bodyguard? You How much will you be willing to pay for it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t answer immediately, thinking for a few tens of seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I will tell you the specifics of the task first. After you evaluate it, give me a price. If I can pay it, or have the equivalent item, then the transaction will be reached. In the opposite case, I can only give up. , looking for someone else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man with a gaze is not open, gently beheading, telling Klein to tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein deliberately looked at the living bodies, treating them as normal players, and asking with their eyes, "Would you like to drive those guys out of the room before answering?" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said the pale-faced man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein considered it and said it truthfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I offended a big man, behind There may be a big man supported by the state."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The card room suddenly has no movement, completely silent, and the man with a slightly malicious madness is stiff. In situ, it seems to have turned into a plaster statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly a minute, he slowly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This task is priceless." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啊? Klein didn't react to it for the first time, until the other person turned to the table, he realized that the deal could not be reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are playing a bunch of living corpses playing cards in the room. The performance is very high and the strength is very strong. As a result, you are scared off? You are obviously crazy... Klein doesn't know whether to cry or smile: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The big man is not so free in Beckland." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black vest man ignored him and sat down again. The living corpses began to deal with cards and throw chips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein breathed out and left the room, seeing Kaspas. Kanlining, a half-bone man with rosacea and sputum wounds waiting outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was no deal." Klein spread his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspars did not present amazed emotions, sinking for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He The price is too high?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, he thinks the task is too difficult." Klein did not hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maric is the most terrible person in the people I know. He is not even afraid of bullets. Since he thinks the task is difficult, I don't think I can help you to contact other powerful guys."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately." Klein sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspars clenched his right fist and hit the left chest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The storm is with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I am dead... Klein laughs bitterly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can try to help me ask the powerful guys in other places, I will pay you a certain amount of compensation, um ... I will come again tomorrow night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving a positive answer, he left the brave bar slightly, not even interested in playing a game of billiards. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it too honest? If the commission is described as simple, Maric should have agreed... just don't know how much he will ask for... Hey, let others face the danger in the case of being concealed. This is not my style... As an extraordinary person, if you always violate the inner real thoughts and your own principles, I am afraid that the distance is out of control is not far away... Klein is half-baked and transferred to the carriage and returned to Minsk Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wash is finished, Klein does not waste charcoal, enters the bedroom directly, and draws Curtains keep the room from the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way back, he thought for a while and found that the dangers that might arise were not resolved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the unknown ambassador, his main and most fundamental purpose is to find Ian Wright, the reason why he sent someone to deal with me is Because I want to get Ian's clues, I can't get the answer if I can't get the answer. If I can let him know that I can't find Ian, he can't do it under the supervision of the special department of the military. A thug adventure...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, my appearance, I surpassed his expected strength, let their actions be exposed, suffered serious setbacks, replaced I am the ambassador, and I will definitely think about revenge for venting anger, but it is definitely not now, not the current situation of turbulence.... Well, the premise is that the ambassador has a brain, not just relying on relationships to know only anger. The straw bag... can let him preside over such an important thing, indicating that he should still be more reliable...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the crux of the problem lies in Ian Wright The whereabouts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm... There is still a hidden danger. After the ambassador finally fails, will he deliberately disclose to the military special department that Mersor is an extraordinary person? Let them know that my strength is doubtful, and use their hands to retaliate against me... This is just a slumber, no difficulty, you must beware...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein analysis Clearly aware of his situation, suddenly there is the urge to buy the murderer to kill the unknown ambassador. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thinking about the strong sequence that may exist around him, he is frustrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if the messenger can accept my assignment without the consent of Mr. Azick... It shouldn't work... pay close attention to this matter, Looking for an opportunity to destroy the mouth? Since he sent someone to kill me, I will not have a psychological burden to kill him... Yes, you can consider issuing this task at the Tarot Conference, see Mr. 'Justice' and Mr. There is no way... Maybe, I can spend a lot of money to move Mr. A or the stronger of the same sequence..." Klein suddenly flashed his light and thought of "Tarot." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mind, he settled a lot, flipped through the paper and pen, and wrote the divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ian Wright's whereabouts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After confirming that there were no hidden extraordinary people in the room, Klein looked at the outside Spying on the curtains, while recalling Ian’s appearance, meditating on the divination statement and leaning back against the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian was at the top of the bed, curled up, pressed against the old satchel and was asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream is broken, Klein opens his eyes and interprets the revelation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This accommodation environment only It exists in the Eastern District and the Beckland Bridge area, but it is an unusually large place. Even if the police of the whole Beckland are all dispatched, they cannot be completely checked out..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Ian is very careful, there is nothing left behind me, otherwise I can find him by the method of the stick..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking For a few minutes, Klein picked up the pen and added a piece of content before and after the divination statement, making it a justified statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know Ian Wright’s whereabouts, I found no one after I found Zerel’s body.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper is placed on the desk like that. On top, the edge is pressed against the pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Klein stood up and returned to the bed, quickly confirming whether someone was observing himself with a less obvious coin. Every move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting a negative answer, he quickly reversed four steps, silently recited the mantra and entered the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old palace, Klein refused to examine the situation around him, repeating the divination just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the negative answer has not changed, he is no longer so nervous, looking up and looking to the side, found that the core of the newly added group of deep red stars has been dyed a little Sunshine gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the source of the warmth I feel?" Klein spread spirituality and carefully touched the past in the way of memory and prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light and shadow changed, and a blurry scene emerged quickly in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petite girl and the lady with a brown hair, who was trying to pull it into the fog, stood in front of the "sacrificial stage". A man wearing a white hard shell mask whispers the corresponding name of the eternal sun, creating a warm, pure light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is looking for someone to exorcise? Klein almost laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he finally figured out the reason for the previous situation, not who penetrated the fog, locked him, this kind of "justice", etc. People mourn their names and pray, and when the fog receives the information, it will naturally instinctively give it back to him, but because it is not praying, the sound of the illusory cascading becomes a warm current. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hint, this is a hint, not a hurt and an effect..." Klein made a clear judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he also probably determined one thing, that is, the mysterious space above the fog and the way of "Justice" to establish contact with them. It is not absolutely weird. It is not within the rules of the world. It is still subject to certain constraints and will be affected to some extent by specific methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein continued to look at the picture in front of him, listening to the voice of the voice, suddenly found that this lasted longer than ever before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, he was unable to proactively spy on the corresponding target of the Crimson Star. Unless the other party prayed, he could receive the corresponding scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other situation is that when he gives feedback, he can see the scene and hear the sound of synchronization, but once the response is over, he can no longer get extra The information is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, he is like watching a video, maintaining a reality video that has been filled with mosaics for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He witnessed the petite lady talking to a man wearing a golden mask in the study room, hearing her companion calling her a break, and she understood that she was seeking "security." The official material of the "magic drug"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the two ladies went home, Klein regretted not knowing their house number, "video" Only came to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
