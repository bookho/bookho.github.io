			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really wanted to open you because I want The work involved involves a secret of the church and the night owl, but the death of Cohenri made my head very confusing, and I only thought of a lame reason for you to come back to see.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What secret? Klein asked with ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost forgot the existence of suspected evil gods or mythological creatures.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng’s discretion speaks: “In the mysterious field, there may be a law. Oh, although I have not read many books, I still know what the law means. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This law is called the extraordinary law of immortality. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The extraordinary features will not be destroyed, will not be reduced, but will be transferred from one carrier to another." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's eyes widened and suddenly stunned, thoughtfully asking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "For example, someone who is out of control will leave a seal, a magical item, or a potion master material? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "Deng Enzhen focuses on the road. "It's not just the extraordinary who are out of control... The same is true after the death of the normal extraordinary." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same is true..." Klein chewed Dunn's description and vaguely understood what the captain was doing at the time.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking between the moments, he suddenly remembered one thing, that is, after the death of the tuxedo clown, there was a thumb-sized, slightly blue blood cell suspended in the air next to the body. Frye's explanation is that there will always be some strange changes after the death of the extraordinary.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng ash continues to say:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But unlike the uncontrollable ones, the extraordinary person who died normally is no longer the material and the item, it is slightly equal to the potion, the corresponding potion of the sequence, but lacking Certain auxiliary materials. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly equal to the potion...slightly equal to the potion! Klein’s eyes are shrinking, and there is a flash of lightning inside the mind, endless darkness. So it was illuminated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly understood a lot of things and understood why the extraordinary way would not be broken when the material was cut off.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to using alternatives, you can simply rely on the will of the corresponding extraordinary!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should also be a high sequence One of the reasons for giving only the finished potion! Another reason is to prevent the formula from leaking under extraordinary means such as divination and psychic... Klein’s mind has come up with one guess after another.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng En looked at the door of the night entertainment room, and the voice explained in a low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few years ago, the amount...specifically Years, I don’t remember very much. At that time, I was not the captain of the Night Squad. I found this problem by chance, and it was not long before I became an extraordinary person. Li after the exchange, immediately made a report to the church, the church let me confidence and give me two choices, Oh, this is me explain, rather than Dailey explained the reasons, who were exposed who is responsible. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first choice is pretending not to know, just like most of the night captains and deacons, continue to be arranged by the church to rule the ordinary death. The second relic, the second is to give me a special, simple ritual, and the corresponding skills, let me directly take the items resulting from the accumulation of characteristics within a certain time limit, um, this only applies to itself The route applies only to sequences that are equal to itself, as well as to lower sequences. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will make my extraordinary features stronger and my strengths stronger. Dream-related abilities, I am not much worse than the corresponding sequence 6, which is why I dare to deal with Mrs. Xue Lun. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way...and this kind of thing..." Klein slowly spits.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Well, this is in line with the so-called "law of indestructibility"... Has it been so concentrated that it will change from quantitative to qualitative? Klein thoughts thinking divergently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at him, Dunn showed a bitter smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I chose the second Development, but not to become stronger, really strong, digest the potion as soon as possible, and get the promotion is the best and most direct way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes "Klein sincerely agrees, "This way of gathering the same sequence of equal or lower sequence characteristics, while enhancing the strength, I am afraid it will increase the risk of losing control?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng solemnly shook his head and said: "No, this is something left by the normal extraordinary, not a person who is out of control. Well, after knowing the 'playing the law', I re-examined it again and found that it would Increase the difficulty of digestion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you going to continue?" Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn put his right hand into his pocket and wanted to explore the pipe, but found himself left in the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed at himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just said that I am not trying to become more Powerful to take their relics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, he paused and looked at the gas lamp that had lost the focal length and looked at the opposite side with a blue light. Light, low said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are all my companions... We have experienced a lot of things together, dealing with monsters and crazy cults in the dark, Someone saved me, and I saved many of them. We walked on a quiet night. We fought in places that the public could not see. We were against danger. We guarded each other's backs." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am reluctant to let them, I remember that after the first time I experienced a dangerous mission, Little Yate was scared to collapse on the spot, crying, I remember Adelaide. Hehe, he is the father of Rosanne. He used to help me block an evil curse with my arm. I remember that Daun is a morning. The warm and warm girl always records the things that everyone has experienced. I remember that although Cohenri is not tall, but there will be many things, he will play the lyre, will sing, tell stories, more like a poet than Leonard... ...I am reluctant to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope to continue fighting side by side with them, fighting against the monsters in the dark, all executions of those crazy cults, together with the guardian Root city, so I chose to take what they left behind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun's ashes seem to have a flash of light, his stability and his deepness At this moment, a lot of disintegration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s mouth continues to say slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In my dreams, they still With me, Adelaide likes to read, always staying in the sun drying room to read books. Every time he asks me to discipline Rosanne, let her mature so much that Luo Shan always complains about how I come. The more like his father, the more afraid of me, Xiaoyite is a leisurely person, going to the forest every day to hunt, Daoen always standing in the window of her bedroom, watching us chat, just joined the Cohenli I made a lyre, and I sang and sang there... I can't bear them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain..." Klein whispered subconsciously, he almost The line of sight is blurred, I can't help but raise my hand and wipe my eyes. In my heart, I swear, Mom, Captain, you are cheating on my tears...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I finally understood why the captain was slow to "play the law"... Kline immediately sighed silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a pity that the old Neil is out of control and will die. Otherwise he will bring us a lot of joy." Dunn took back his eyes and bowed his head. The position between the two eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, he raised his head and smiled bitterly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a Selfish decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what Adelaide and Cohenley really want, and they made decisions for them selfishly. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." Klein shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sofa area of ​​the reception hall, Leonard looks at the Meco Silk grabbed a handful of hair and saw the expression stiff again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mego Ossie continually irritated and continually picked up the cup to drink, and his face looked a little distorted and looked at Leonard Road:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know why, I suddenly feel a little uncomfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Mitchell is waiting to answer, suddenly seeing Mei Gaoousi raised her hand and grabbed her own face. She grabbed a piece of meat, a long piece of meat, and was covered with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My face is a little itchy." Mei Gaoousi smiled embarrassedly, his mouth cracked to the cheekbones, revealing the white teeth inside. And bright red gums. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXX! Leonard silently sweared and felt that the situation had deteriorated too quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His lips twitched, listening to the side, and his expression suddenly changed color, a piece of iron blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He barely squeezed out his smile, and he continued to grab his face and keep grabbing the flesh and blood of Mecoo::<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went to the bathroom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good...the..." Meco's tone became a little erratic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She touched her own stomach:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My...child...somewhat uneasy ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard did not respond, speeding up the pace, close to the partition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the corridor, he looked deeply at the urn of the saints of Dunn Smith, and spit in relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his expression became persevering:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, I am afraid it’s too late, we must Immediately solve Megacoos and the baby in her belly, otherwise, the entire city of Tingen will suffer huge losses. This is not something that can be avoided by evacuating the surrounding people. I know that you have already taken such a telegram." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den’s frowning, asked very seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have determined that the situation has deteriorated to this Degree?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, no more than three minutes, Megacoos will change, her child will be born in advance." Leonard Affirmative tone replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he glanced at the thick blood vessels wrapped around Klein’s hand and said: “The seal '2-105'? Give it to me. I can play its role better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Klein did not hesitate to hand over the "blood thief" to Leonard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what he is going to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Dunn Smith pulled the neckline and patted the black thin windbreaker, and his attitude was firmly open:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go out with the ashes of St. Serena. You will have ten seconds to remember, and then come out to fight after the number of times. Whenever, my condition is good or bad. You can't waste time, aiming at Megacoos and the baby in her belly to make your most powerful attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he Turned over, holding the urn, straight up to the partition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain..." Klein shouted dryly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain." Leonard also shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
