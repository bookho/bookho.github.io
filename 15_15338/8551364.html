			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a problem there." Kline pointed to the steps separating the living room and dining room, and said with solemnity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen in the internal data of the night-watchers that if there is a similar situation in the inspiration, it often means that the target location is hidden with evil and filthy things, if It’s not sure, it’s best not to try to touch it, otherwise it’s easy to lose your life – sometimes, even if you just look at it, you will suffer irreversible damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teng followed the look of the past, and the inspiration was equally high. He immediately found out that he was wrong. He looked at Klein sideways and said: "You are divining." Exploring whether it will go well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the castle, the captain did not let me divination, quite confident... This shows that he thinks hidden things may be better than The grievance is even more dangerous... Klein nodded silently, put away the revolver, and handed the cane to Frye next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he untied the citrine pendant in his cuff, held the silver chain with his left hand, and considered the appropriate divination statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, his eyes turned dark, and an invisible breeze swirled around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exploring the hidden location of the castle will be smooth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Explore the hidden places of the castle Will be smooth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seven times of meditation, Klein’s eyes returned to normal, I saw the citrine pendant being rotated clockwise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the magnitude is not large, it is indeed doing a clockwise turn! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that exploration will go smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who has become a true diviner, immediately bowed to Dunn and Frye:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The danger is within the scope that can be solved, or not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean wears the "variant sun emblem" to the left chest and reaches out to press himself The silk hat, walked quickly to the steps, and looked at the organs with skill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning the Frye sticks picked up by the iron gloves to Klein, holding the revolver, guarding the guards around, seems to be afraid that an enemy will suddenly emerge. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still not professional enough... In the field of night-timers... Klein is uplifting, re-extracting his revolver and following up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Dunn Smith, who had been squatting for a while, didn’t know what it was, and the position of the steps suddenly made a heavy voice of Zazaza. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floor there is cracked open, revealing the downward steps, the cold and dirty feelings are filled, almost to be solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun looked at him and took off the seal "3-0782" on his chest and threw it directly into the secret door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dangdang jumped a few times, the "Various Sun Emblem" did not know where to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a Necrotic creature inside, it will definitely throw "3-0782" back... It’s interesting... Klein stares down The ladder, wait patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coldness and filth that are not circling quickly is like the snow and the sun, and the warmth and purity cover the entrance to the dark door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein, the two of us went down, and Frye stayed in place to prevent other enemies from destroying the institution." Dunn made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein didn't stop again. He went up two steps and walked over to Dunn. Frye nodded lightly and did not relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪,啪,啪, Dunn took the lead down the stairs, and the footsteps echoed silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not prepared for things like a lantern or a torch, because for the extraordinary of the "sleepless" sequence, darkness is not an obstacle, but a care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an environment, their sights are not affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few steps down, Dunn suddenly turned back and looked at Klein: "I forgot that you don't have dark vision. I am used to not preparing those items that are illuminated... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Captain, you don't have to care, I have a vision." Klein found himself feeling a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handsome captain just like that is not the norm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his spirit, the darkness in front is filled with gray, although it is very vague, but it can make him barely see the ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the captain is very healthy, and his mental state is also very good... Klein carefully walks his feet and walks slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stairs are not long, and they touch the ground after slanting down the 14th and 5th steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seal "3-0782" is lying here, exuding warmth, spreading purity, and shining shimmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this light, Klein saw it more clearly. He looked around and found that it was not a big basement. The original shade was gone, but The humidity still exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a black coffin in the center of the basement with a dark red color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lid of the coffin has been pushed out of a gap, and it can be seen with white bones and white bones without heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng En looked around four times before he stooped to pick up the "variant sun emblem". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, this coffin, um, its role is to prevent the dead inside from becoming zombies or resentment..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein examines the dark red nails on the black coffin, examines how they are arranged, and relies on his own esoteric knowledge to identify that it is an ancient ritual. , a ceremony to prevent corpses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he snarled in his heart: But, under normal circumstances, who would be fine to beware of his relatives? Hey, the people who help the burial are not necessarily relatives... Well, putting the coffin in the basement, not in the tomb, is afraid of being discovered...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Dunn, wearing the seal "3-0782", took a close look at the coffin and carefully watched it for a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The deceased should be poisoned and dead." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the person who poisoned him and used ritual magic to guard against his corpse revenge... This should be the thing one thousand three hundred and four hundred years ago? In the end, it turned out to be a resentment... This idea is simply amazing!” Klein also walked to the coffin. “What about his head? The ceremony doesn’t need to cut his head...”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng thought of the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a speculation that this grievance does not always exist, but It has only recently appeared. It takes only a quarter of an hour to walk to the old town. The tricksters of the past generations must come over often, but before this incident, there was no rumor that the castle had resentment."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein Micro invisible nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, you mean, someone recently came here and opened Coffin, took the head of the deceased?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, that ritual prevented the deceased from dying, but also locked its resentment in the coffin, disguised Save, wait until the coffin is opened, the ceremony is lifted, and those resentments will soon become a resentment with the help of their own iron gloves..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person who opened the coffin did not Leave the body, not an ordinary person...and what does he take away from the head of the deceased?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun gaze at the white bones in the coffin: "Resentment Can stay for so long, in addition to the ritual reasons, there should be the sake of the deceased itself, he may be extraordinary before his death, or belong to the descendants of the two generations who are at least in the middle of the sequence, um, I mean the previous definition Medium sequence, sequence 6 or sequence 5."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And such corpses always have Something special, his head may be used in certain ceremonies and on certain occasions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
