			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a moment, Klein decided to go home first and confirm one thing. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he believes that the action of the doomsday puppet last night, if not specifically for the sake of seeing the pattern on the paper, the captain will surely find clues when they follow up. Self-reported reports do not affect the overall situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a deserving consideration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Klein wants to confirm next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to Daffodil Street in a trackless public carriage. When he returned home, his brother, Banson and his sister Melissa, who were on Sunday, had not yet got up, the living room. The tranquility is dark and silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein burned the pot of water, lost some tea, and ate an oatmeal bread before holding the coat, hat and cane to the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously lightened his footsteps and did not create significant noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second floor, he saw the door of the bathroom suddenly open, and Melissa, wearing a long rag dress, looked like a sleepy eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are back..." Melissa blinked a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein covered his mouth and yawned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I need A wonderful dream, don't wake me up before lunch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa "hmm", suddenly remembered what it said:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My and Benson are going to the St. Serena Church in the morning to pray and participate in the mass. The lunch may be a little late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As a goddess of the night god is not too devout believer, she and Banson kept the frequency of going to church for two weeks, and Klein, who is a night-time player, has not been tracked by the members of the secret society. Into the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I am in the church every day, just the bottom of the church... Klein subconsciously argued in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very worried about the goddess abandoning himself as a false believer. If the ritual magic fails to respond, the joke can be opened...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But think about the old Neil, the goddess is quite tolerant to the night owl, um, that's right! Klein is self-provocative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These divergent thoughts flashed past. He looked at Melissa and smiled and nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No problem, I just can sleep for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Melissa, he entered his bedroom and locked the door with his backhand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he followed the spirit and took out the ritual silver enamel to create a sealed spiritual wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Klein stepped back four steps, silently recited the mantra, resisting the frantic cry and entering the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this illusory and innocent world, he is the only living creature, sitting on the ancient mottled bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm for a few tens of seconds, Klein has a piece of parchment, writing a divination mantra:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The pattern shown by the doom puppet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment last night, Klein saw the mysterious pattern on the paper, but because of the tension and hasty For the sake of it, he just remembers probably, can't recall the specific details, but this is not a problem. For the diviner, as long as you have seen it, remember that there is such a thing, you can reproduce it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——According to the mystical theory, spirituality remembers everything that is seen, and as long as the method is appropriate, it can re-present the scene at a particular moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirituality itself, even if it is not the entire ocean, contains all the seas around the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the divination mantra, Klein leaned back and went to sleep in a meditation manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of twists, twists, and deviations, he once again saw the Chanis Gate opened by Zaza and heard heavy friction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doll wearing a black classical court dress clung to the open half of the door and unfolded the paper in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the paper, there are numerous mysterious symbols, which together form a vertical eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the pattern deeply, took the initiative to quit the dream, and then expressed the memory that had not faded with the help of the special above the fog:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the brown parchment, the vertical eyes "looking up" above, evil and mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it, writing under the eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is The key to the treasures left by the Antignus family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the pen, he untied the silver chain wrapped around the cuff and held it with his left hand until The citrine pendant hangs steadily over the divination statement and the mysterious vertical eye, no longer visibly shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed his eyes and meditated silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven times, he opened his eyes and saw the citrine pendant being rotated clockwise with a small silver chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is affirmation in the spirit of the pendulum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The vertical eye pattern is really the key to the treasures left by the Antignus family..." Klein seemed to nod in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fingers tapped on the edge of the bronze long table, silently saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bieber died, the descendants of the Antigonus family were cut off, so that note took me as a successor to the 'divination' who was exposed to it and lived?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It affects 3-0625, leaving the key to the treasure, letting the other person show me when I turn the Chanis Gate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no problem with this logic, but I still can't convince me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How does the note confirm that the bloody descendants of the Antigonus family are extinct?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I am a totally irrelevant person... If I also have the blood of the Antignus family, the original Lord will not be killed." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, this matter doesn't tell the captain that they don't seem to matter, I will study it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Ryan also divined the location of the Treasures of the Antigonus family, but there was no doubt that no detailed information was obtained. The only certainty was that, like the speculation in the letter that Sirius wrote to Mr. Z, Treasure and Honach The main peak of the mountains is related to the ancient night country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divination After these things, Klein found that the deep red star with the praying sound had a slight fluctuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched the illusory star in a way that responded to the prayer, and once again saw the brown-haired boy wearing unique black tight-fitting clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young boy still knees on the ground, still facing the pure crystal ball, still whispering something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Klein, who had learned a small amount of dragon language, finally managed to understand one of the sentences:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for...Save...Father and mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a dragon...and where is the dragon now? ? These are all old antiques calculated in millennium... Unfortunately, my mysterious ruler above the fog is just empty shelves, and I can't save if I want to save... Klein shook his head and sighed, and decided to observe it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the bedroom, he lifted the spiritual wall, put on old but comfortable clothes, lay down on the bed, and began to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein slept and slept until half past twelve until Melissa, who had finished the lunch, knocked at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used a fairly good lunch, he saw Melissa take the matching hat with the new dress, and she would go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else are you doing in the afternoon?" Klein asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson, who was sitting on the couch and frowning on grammar books, did not help but replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Mrs. Shaw, who is next door, told Melissa that there was a lecture on family affairs in the small auditorium in the afternoon. Melissa planned to listen and learn how to deal with daily family problems.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa followed and nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found Selena and Elizabeth to accompany me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I hope that the lecture teacher told you that families like us need to hire at least one miscellaneous maid." Klein said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Melissa wants to refute, he immediately added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We want to Limited time to invest in more valuable things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa stunned for a long time before she licked her mouth, put on a silk hat, and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At two o'clock in the afternoon, Klein reappeared in Blackthorn Security . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you go back to rest?" asked Luo Shan and Dunn Smith, who was in the reception hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was going to the divination club, but always remembered Last night, so I came over first, did the church have a reply?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng looked at Luo Shan, silently turned, walked to the partition, walked in My own office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roshan made a face to his back and whispered fiercely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The captain is really..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doing well! Klein sighed with a smile and followed Dunn into his office with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door is closed, Dunn sniffs the pipe:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confirmation is the problem of the Antignus family note, and reposition it as a '1' seal, but unfortunately, you are not enough to read the confidentiality level."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“1” level, highly dangerous level, only the staff above the level of the bishop and the night squad leader can know the specific situation? In other words, the captain couldn't figure out what was going on... Highly dangerous, no wonder... Klein thought a little regret and relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun looked at him and continued:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church also let us check After the Nice Gate, there are still items infected with this note. After confirmation, only '3—0625' is abnormal, we have replaced its seal.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Is there any other discovery?" Klein asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein thought about the decapitation, did not talk more about this topic, after a few words, he left to go to the divination club to continue his "digestive journey." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
