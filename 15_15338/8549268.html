			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister, can you not choose which pot does not open? Which Klein secretly vomits, only to feel that his head is beginning to take a pumping pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original forgotten knowledge is not too much, and it is definitely quite a lot. It will be interviewed the day after tomorrow, and there is time to make up...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it’s also involved in a horrible incident, how could you have a mind to “review”...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein began to pretend to read, and Melissa moved the chair and sat next to it, doing the homework with the light of the gas lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere is quiet and happy. At eleven o'clock, the brothers and sisters are good nights and go to bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a knock on the door, Klein woke up from his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the morning sun outside his eyes, his head turned slightly confused and sat up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Who?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What time is it? Why didn't Melissa wake me up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, Dunn Smith." There was a steady male voice outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dune Smith? I don't know... Klein shakes his head and goes out to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the door and saw the police officer with gray eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Kline asked with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash police officer answered with a serious expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We found a coachman, he confirmed On the 27th, the day of the death of Mr. Welch and Ms. Naya, I went to Mr. Welch’s residence, and it was the money that Mr. Welch paid for you.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stunned and there was no horror and guilt about being exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he was not lying at all, he felt that the evidence provided by the assaulted police officer Dunn Smith was not as expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 27th, the original owner really went to Welch’s residence, and he committed suicide on the night of his return, exactly the same as Welch and Naya! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein opened his mouth and made a bitter smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not powerful enough The evidence cannot directly prove that I am related to the death of Welch and Naya. To be honest, I also want to know the passing of the incident and figure out the experiences of my two poor friends. However, I really can’t remember it. I almost completely forgot what I did on the 27th, and you may not believe it. I rely on my own notes to make it hard to guess that I may have been to Welch’s residence on the 27th."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Psychological quality is good." Ashes police officer Dunn Smith nodded and did not see a smile and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should be able to hear my sincerity." Klein looked straight into the other's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am telling the truth, of course, just part of the truth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn Smith did not respond immediately, and his eyes swept the room for a short time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Welch lost a revolver, I think I should be able to find him here, right, Mr. Klein?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure... gram Ryan finally figured out the origin of the revolver, and his mind turned like a lightning jump, and made a decision in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hands halfway, stepped back, let the road open, and then pointed his chin to the high and low bed:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the back of the bed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t specifically say the following, because normal people wouldn’t hide things on the back of the upper deck, which would make visitors See it at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ashes police officer Dunn did not move forward and took a corner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing to think Do you want to add it?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein answers without hesitation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I woke up in the middle of the night, I found myself kneeling on the desk, next to the revolver, with bullets on the wall and it looked like I had experienced a suicide. Just maybe I have no experience, I have never used a pistol, or I am afraid at the last minute. In short, the bullet did not achieve the desired effect, my head is still intact, I lived to the present. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And since then, I have forgotten some memories, including what I have done to Welch on the 27th, what I saw, I didn't lie, I really don't remember. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to clear the suspicion, in order to solve the strange incident of entanglement, Klein almost said everything, except for crossing and "party." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, he has modified the wording so that every sentence can stand the test, such as not saying that the bullet has not hit the head, only mentioning that it has not reached the expected The effect is that the head is still intact afterwards.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the other person's ear, the two almost express the same meaning, but they are actually quite different.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy Police Officer Dunn listened quietly, calmly opening:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is in line with my speculation and also The hidden logic of similar events before, of course, I don't know how you survived. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You believe it, I don't know how I survived." Klein was a little relieved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But. "Dun has thrown a turning point. "I believe it is useless. Now you have a high suspicion. You must confirm with the 'expert' that you have truly forgotten the encounter, or really did not directly lead to Mr. Welch. And the death of Ms. Naia. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coughed and his expression became serious:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Klein, please cooperate The investigation, and we go back to the police station, it takes about two to three days, if you really have no problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The expert is here? Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Didn’t you say that for two days?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is better than us It is expected to be early. Dunn leaned over his body and motioned for Klein to go out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I left a note. Klein asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson was still on a business trip, Melissa went to school and could only leave a message telling them something about Welch. Let them not worry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dune doesn't care about the nod:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein returned to his desk and found out the paper while he was thinking about the next thing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Honestly, he really doesn't want to see the expert, after all, he still has a bigger secret.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where there are seven churches Under the premise that the "predecessor" Russell the Great was assassinated, the "crossing" of this kind of thing is mostly to enter the referee, the arbitral tribunal!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is no weapon, no fighting skills, no extraordinary power, where is the opponent of a professional police officer, not to mention, there are several Dunn’s subordinates standing outside the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;They pulled a gun and volleyed, and they even confessed!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call, take a step and take a step. Klein left the note, took the key, and followed Dunn out of the room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark corridor, four black-clothed policemen were on both sides and were very alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, hey, hey, Klein is beside Dunn, stepping on the wooden stairs, step by step, and sometimes you can hear it. Yeah's voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a four-wheeled single-horse carriage parked outside the apartment. The side of the car is marked with a police system logo with a "double sword cross and a crown". It’s as hot as every morning, and it’s crowded and noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go up." Dunn gestured to Klein first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was just about to take a step, and suddenly a hawker selling oysters grabbed a customer and accused the other of being a thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides wrestled and shocked the horses, and the surrounding became suddenly confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein couldn’t think too much, slammed forward and rushed into the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or shoving, or dodging, he fled wildly, heading for the other side of the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current situation, in order not to "see" the experts, you can only go to the pier outside the city, take the boat down the Tasok River, and flee to the capital of Baekeland. De Go, where the population is large and easy to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, you can also take the steam train, go east to the nearest port of Enmat, take the sea to Plitz, and then head to Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short time, Klein ran to the street and turned into Iron Cross Street, where several hireable carriages were parked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the pier outside the city." Klein grabbed one of them and jumped on one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought very clearly, first deliberately misleading the chasing police, and when the carriage pulled out a distance, he would jump directly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." The driver picked up the reins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, the carriage drove off the Iron Cross Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein was preparing to jump, he suddenly found the carriage turning to another road, not the road to the outside of the city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you going?" Klein snorted and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to Welch's residence..." The coachman's voice did not meet up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? Klein was amazed, the coachman turned his body, revealing a deep, indifferent gray eyelid, and it was a police officer, Dunn Smith! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" Klein was frightened and inexplicably, and the whole man suddenly sat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit up? Klein looked left and right in confusion, and found that the red moon was shining outside the window, and the room was covered with "light yarn." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and touched his forehead, moist and cold, all with cold sweat, the same feeling behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A nightmare..." Klein sighed slowly. "Fortunately, okay..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that his dreams are quite clear, but he can still think calmly, which is quite strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a slight easing, Klein took a look at the pocket watch and found that it was more than two o'clock in the middle of the night, so he whispered out of bed and went to the public bathroom to wash his face. By the way, the lower abdomen problem of swelling is solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twisting the door, he came to the dim aisle, with a weak and indistinguishable moonlight, and his footsteps were very lightly close to the common bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw a figure in front of the window at the end of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure is wearing a black-like style that is shorter than the robes and longer than the formal wear,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure Semi-integrated into the darkness, bathed in the cold red moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure slowly turned over the body, his eyes were deep, gray, and indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
