			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the "World" and "Sun" exchanges were completed, the Tarot party entered the free chat session, "Justice" Audrey was interested Asked about the unique scenery and anecdotes in the sea, "Danghang" Alger is selectively describing according to his own knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" Foers quietly listened, gradually got inspiration, wanted to write a novel about the pirate king, wrote that he captured a female passenger, And there is a story of love and hate, and the coexistence of fantasy and reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik can only imagine what the sea looks like based on the paintings and corresponding texts of the Silver City collection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day, Klein, whose spirits are gradually exhausting, announces the end of this Tarot party and quickly returns to the real world, making up for a nap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 7:30 pm, Queens, seems to belong to a certain Inside a noble house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls put on a hooded robes and, after many days, participated in the party organized by Mr. A. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat quietly in the corner, and looked around casually, and found that Mr. A, who was sitting alone on a single sofa, seemed to be a little different than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a change in appearance and temperament, because the face of the other person is completely hidden in the shadow of the hood, and Firth can not see clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels different, just a near-intuitive feeling:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A is no longer like So leisurely and indifferent, always looking at everyone in a down-to-head attitude. Today, he seems to be very depressed, trying to control what is being done, and the dangerous expectations are rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Mr. A was a mountain. Now he is closer to the body and spit out the core of the snake... The best-selling novelist Foers suddenly rejoices himself. In order to conceal the Tarot Club, in order not to let Hugh know that he is buying items in the solar field, he did not come to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, even if there is any unexpected change, my escape will be much simpler... Firth turned the bracelet with only two stones left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not in a hurry to write her own needs into a note, to the waiter, but to patiently watch for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not her natural cautiousness, but the past few lessons have left a deep impression on her, only two of the stones on the bracelet are evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, she finally picked up the paper and pen in front of her and wrote it with a deliberately distorted handwriting:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buy a magical item in the sun or a powerful weapon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After handing the note to the waiter, Fols looked around again A circle, but can not find the "eternal yang" believers who helped to hold the purification and exorcism ceremony from the many people who have disguised or disguised themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pile of transactions was brewing in the shuttle bus between the waiters, and the entire hall was quiet and orderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the discussion and communication in the middle, Firth’s needs were added to the front two blackboards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, she received a reply from the waiter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small piece of white paper is filled with dense words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fantastic items 'Light Ring' ring, which can make the wearer become the messenger of light, the sun's attendant, immune to many diseases, master the divine power, the wearer can summon the dazzling beam, can use many sun field spells, can purify five The necromancer within ten meters is the nemesis of this kind of creature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through this ring, the wearer recognizes that it will be improved, disapproval Will be weakened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to get it, please pay 9,000 pounds of cash at a time, I can wait for you to raise it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;000 pounds? Fols opened his mouth and there was a feeling of robbery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge amount of wealth that she can't borrow even if she is looking for someone to borrow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the assassination of the deposits of Ambassador Intis, up to now, all the money she has seen has not increased so much! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who owns 9,000 pounds of cash, even in Beckland, is definitely a rich man! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I know that magical items are expensive, I have never thought that they can be expensive to this extent... This is to get the extravagant if you want to get 9,000 pounds. Party, exit this circle, enjoy life with peace of mind? Fols quietly took a breath and did not dare to respond to each other for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pretended to have been listening for almost ten minutes, but did not wait for another response, did not wait for a relatively cheap and extraordinary weapon, had to get up and go to the bathroom . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there were no ones, she closed the toilet door and sat down on the toilet, mourning the name of Mr. Fool, and what happened just now. The form of prayer tells the other party and asks him to convey to the "world." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the boundless gray fog, Klein, who heard the unreal cascading sound, quickly entered and grasped the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;000 pounds? He meditated on this number and his expression was slightly distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After silently calculating the money that can be raised in the short term, he sighed and showed the world of "dummy" and manipulated him to respond:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The negative problem with this magical item is too serious, I don't want to be a believer in the sun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You don't have to worry about this, we switch to cash transactions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pay for £450, the recipe for 'Master of the Master' is yours. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, the contact was interrupted, Klein looked at the "world" disappeared, raised his hand and licked his forehead, saying to himself: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next step is to see the clues of what the 'barbarians' can collect..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Otherwise, you can only find the 'eye of wisdom' old man to buy that brooch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the washroom, Fols sighed, Sacrifice ceremony held after the show to go back as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I don’t know the formula yet, otherwise I can take the opportunity to see if there is any extraordinary material I need... She went back to the hall, her eyes focused on Sweep through the information on the two boards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not respond to the previous note, even did not consider the bargaining problem, because even if she can make the other party cheaper 1000 pounds, she has no money to buy, turnover is not Open, and more crucially, she feels that Mr. "World" does not seem to be able to afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always watching and ending, due to the change of Mr. A, she did not stop, did not talk to people, and quickly left the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, the party was completely over, leaving only Mr. A and his waiters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. A slowly stood up and walked down the stairs to the basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he bent his knees and fell to the ground, rolling several steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is there, the shadow under him is red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His flesh and blood melted and immersed in it, making the shadow look like a brand new, skinless, monster-like person separated from his body. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the separated flesh and blood "flowed" back again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything becomes nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. A moved forward and reached the basement, once again choked to make repentance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things before the confession were mistaken, not alert enough, and the cause of the Lord’s coming was destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baiyin City, Dairik Berg's home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked around the table and walked silently for several laps. He never made up his mind. His reason told him that the advice of Mr. Good choices, but the minds of other members who participated in the mission will always flash in their minds. They feel that they pretend to be out of control and will not give up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there no way to save them? I want to find a chance to see the chief, the half-destroyed temple belongs to the fallen creator, belongs to the evil spirits who are in charge of the "shepherd" way, tells him to let him be careful of the elder Lloydya and replace the mission. Responsible person... But, where should I know where to know? In their eyes, Mr. "The Fool" should also be equal to the evil spirits... Dairik irritated and grabbed his hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hurricane axe is placed at the most within reach, with every ray of lightning passing through the window, a faint glimmer of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Derick stopped and looked out into the dark and dark environment, looking at the dark sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have seen the way his parents died before they died, and found the feeling of suffering a stabbing sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time is too late... I will be prepared to let the discovery of the "fallen creator" not be suspected..." His expression is distorted For a while, biting his teeth, whispered a few words, then violently left the window, returned to the table, began to consume his spirituality in the way of practicing the "praying man" extraordinary ability, let it fly close to dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The luxury villa in the Earl of Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the studio, Audrey, who was smeared with oil paint, heard a rhythmic knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the close-servant Anne opened the door, she discovered that the visitor turned out to be her mother, Countess Caitlin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the lady is close to fifty, she seems to be in her early thirties, blond, glamorous and graceful enough to attract the attention of most gentlemen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, is there anything?" Audrey put down the items in her hand and asked with a puzzled face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countess looked at her little daughter who was more beautiful than she was when she was younger, laughing and laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I just attended the dinner party. Mrs. Jura said that you are very interested in psychology. I want to ask a tutor, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but I haven't decided yet..." Audrey answered hesitantly, as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Countess still can't see her daughter's mind, smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She recommended A psychiatrist named Islant, if you have no problem, I will send someone to invite her, twice a week, how?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You take your idea." Audrey smiled a little bit, "Mom, come, sit here, I am missing a beautiful model!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... .........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday morning, Klein identified the party called "The Eye of Wisdom" from the "Beckland Morning Post". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly breathed a sigh of relief, no longer worried about whether the item could catch up with Miss Sharon’s enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
