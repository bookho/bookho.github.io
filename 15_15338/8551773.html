			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? Klein was stunned by Rosanne’s question and recalled abruptly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“When I went to the old Neil’s house, it was the last one. In the month, I found a piano in the living room. He told me that his deceased wife liked music..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Klein was shocked. Inexplicably got some bad ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roshan wrinkles good-looking eyebrows, not quite surely said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe me I remember correctly... No, I was with Mrs. Oliana in the first half of the year. They often went to the old Neil’s house. At that time, there was no piano in the living room. I clearly remembered that I asked him why he kept being single. The answer is that I didn’t meet the lady who wanted him to marry...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no piano in the first half of the year... still answering the question of why staying single Klein tightened his body and asked in a deep voice: "Roshan, how long have you been away from the old Neil family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since Cohen Li turned into a night, Viola chose to leave here, no longer a civilian, I am staying up late, or sleeping, how can I go to someone else's house... Well, starting in early June." Luo Shan was asked Some confused, can only answer honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein heard a heart sinking and seemed to feel something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was busy pulling a half-penny denomination coin from his pocket, sandwiched between the thumb and middle finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a deep breath, Klein took a moment to quickly finalize the "Divination Statement." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Neil is in the wrong state now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Neil is in the wrong condition "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silent silence, his eyes flew black, the whole People have entered a state of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;铮! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His thumb bounces, letting the brass-colored penny fly in the air, constantly rolling and rotating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! The coin fell, just in the palm of Klein's spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, George III’s head is facing up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the avatar is correct, indicating yes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the situation of the old Neil is really wrong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the coin, and he remembered that he had just been promoted, and quickly grasped the vision, and saw that there was a pair of almost transparent and abnormal behind the old Neil. Indifferent, long eyelashes, strange and illusory eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His interpretation at the time was a representation of the ritual magic residue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, I also saw a near-invisible figure in the shadow of the doorway. His color of the gas field is exactly the same as the surrounding dimly lit environment... I completely digested the "Divination" potion that time, and secretly changed the switch of the spirit to the light button. After that, I tried it and looked at the old Neil at random. As a result, he suddenly coughed and coughed. Heart cracked lungs... The scene of the scene flashed in Klein's mind, making his expression more dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roshan looked at him and asked with fear and fear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Willn't you get out of control? No, although he is stingy and jealous, he wants to reimburse everything, but he is actually a good person, rarely really angry, no, no, out of control..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not sure, but I think that Neil is just getting out of control." Klein comforted Roshan with a sentence, and quickly stepped through the partition and pushed the door of the captain's office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn Smith is drinking coffee, was shocked by the sudden intruder, almost reached himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" He didn't blame Klein, his expression became very serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein replied quite succinctly but without concealing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, I am in the wrong situation of Dinar."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last Neil told me last month that his deceased wife likes music, but today Rosanne says he has remained single."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"And, on the day I became an extraordinary person, I saw the illusory eyes behind the old Neil looking at everything, and the near-transparent figure at the door was prying. He told me that this is a representation of the ritual magic residue. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't feel right, so I tried divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng After listening to the face, he smiled and brushed up and walked toward the coat rack. He asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don’t you directly divination? Out of control?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This month, the old Neil is no different from the normal extraordinary, even with me to help Swyne In addition to a person who is out of control, I have observed the color of his gas field several times with his vision. He found that he is relatively healthy, but he is a little aging. Therefore, I think he is just getting out of control and there are certain signs. There is room for recovery." Klein expressed his point of view in one breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den wears a black top hat, puts on a knee-length trench coat, and gently slaps it first:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It makes a very reasonable guess... We are going to visit Old Neil now, um, try to avoid stimulating him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then, try to control him, use The ritual magic stabilizes his state and curbs his deterioration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control... Klein heard the word, suddenly a flash of light:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, can we use the seal '3—0611'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been thinking about how Solving the old Neil thing, trying to save the other party, but because it was too flustered, too uneasy, too worried, never found a clue, until I was awakened by the words of Dunn Smith, I remembered that there was such a seal. The utility can come in handy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Number: 0611."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Name: Quiet hair ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hazard rating: '3', there is a certain risk, need to be used with care, only three or more actions can be applied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Privacy level: full members of the night and above."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seal: not in direct contact with living creatures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Description: This is a simple accessory made up of many deep black long hairs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as there is no protection It, all living creatures lose all their desires and emotions, including but not limited to hunger, anger, sadness, pain, jealousy, envy, hatred, happiness, satisfaction and greed."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It has been confirmed that the affected creatures will disappear even if they are out of contact with 0611. They will stay in the same place and stay until the end of their lives."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is an external force that disengages the affected person from 0611, the former will gradually return to normal, but the experiment It shows that all the conditions established contact time is not more than two hours. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After contact for more than two hours, the affected person will be quiet forever." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The highest level of the subject is sequence 5. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can avoid direct contact by wearing gloves, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These hairs are not available The characteristics of living, there is no attempt to escape the trend of the seal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Appendix: These hairs appear in the event of a promotion failure, is a captain of the night Can successfully enter the relics of Sequence 6."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Kline’s words, Dunn’s ashes sneaked deeper: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Awesome proposal, I almost forgot '3—0611’, you go Looking for Luo Yao in the entertainment room, I took out the seal after going to the door of Chanis and came back to make up the application."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's it, don't waste time! Klein did not delay, and immediately came to the night entertainment room, shouting out the "sleeper" Luo Yao, who had few expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the mission?" asked the brunette as smooth as the satin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein breathed a sigh of relief and answered slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Visit the old Neil. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Visit the old Neil...he?" Luo Yao’s eyes widened and there was some bad guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not sure." Klein nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Yao did not speak again, the two fell into silence at the same time, and there seemed to be something in the surrounding air that was a little bit condensed and became heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Dunn finally returned from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wore black gloves and clutched a bunch of messy black hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the "variant sun emblem", "quiet hair" has no obvious external anomaly, if it falls on the road, it is easy Will be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After calling the driver Cesare, a group of four people set foot on the journey to the old Neil family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wheel rolled over the muddy road that had just rained, and the cabin was quieter than in the middle of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Dunn sighed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, there was a couple who was about to get engaged, but she suddenly became seriously ill and difficult to heal. Old Neil tried to save her with ritual magic at the risk of revealing the secrets of extraordinary people, but still failed to succeed. Neil, in the field of occultism, is just getting started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" According to the records, the night-timers were wary that the old Neil would lose control and let Fortunately, he eventually recovered his reason and did not show any abnormality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this is also a false alarm...Kline can’t help but chest Drew a red moon and whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the goddess protect him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Dunn and Luo Yao also followed the same action:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May Goddess bless him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;............< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is getting brighter, the dark clouds are completely gone, and the carriage of the night squad stopped in front of the old Neil house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After letting Cesare catch the carriage and hiding in the distance, Dunn converges on the emotions, holding a stick and holding the seal "3—0611" in one hand. The ashes sneaked into the main entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pressed the half-high silk hat, and Luo Yao, behind the captain, passed through the garden with roses and golden mint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving at the door, Klein stepped forward and pulled the rope that connected the bell inside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮叮当当当! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisp and pleasant ringing echoed in the room, breaking the quiet silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮叮当当当! Dangdang! Klein continued to pull a few times, politely back, no more attempts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three nights waited patiently for a few minutes, but never heard the footsteps of someone coming to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, Neil went to see a doctor, not at home." Klein squeezed a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
