			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene immediately reminds Klein of the romance story that Tallim Dumont said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;His noble friend, fell in love with a civilian woman, she is not jealous, this is absolutely not allowed in the top circle of the nobility, Talim is very annoyed for this, almost hiring murder But in the end he convinced the woman and let her take the initiative to leave his friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the protagonist of this story be Edsac Augustus? The situation in all respects is very consistent. As a prince and a civilian, in the current era, it is a deviant act. Since Lun’s founding, the spouse of the immediate members of the Augustus family is only a noble woman. ... Listening to what was revealed in the words just now, did Edsack find the civilian woman back? Moreover, she was given a penalty for her forbidden? True love... It’s just an instant, and Klein’s mind has a story of a tyrannical prince and a poor little white flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He emptied his eyes and appreciated the scenery ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now is not what it really looks like, until spring, the green grass sprouts, you will see a golf course of the highest specification." Prince Edsac sent Take the maid, raise the whip and point to the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Golf?" Klein asked for the answer at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince Edsac signaled that the guards and the entourage were far away, leaving only the old butler and Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked on the ridiculous flat land and laughed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, golf This is a movement that truly belongs to the nobility. It is difficult for most magazines and newspaper owners to have the opportunity to participate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although I don't like Russell, I have to admit that his whimsy has given us a world that is interesting enough. If you can figure out the death of Tallim, you will be open to you at any time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Russell... Klein gave a soft breath.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See him Without responding, Prince Edsac continued to sigh with his own feelings:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Russell is worth learning in all aspects, but his attitude towards feelings Let me be disgusting. Of course, this is the commonality and style of most Intis nobles, and they are the root of their fascination with luxury and life. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed Sack looked at the creek with slow and slow waters, using a mature tone that transcends age:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ninety-nine percent of the people are not geniuses like Russell. To be successful and build a great cause, you must figure out what you really want and be willing to pay for it. What kind of price, and never go back firmly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, his tone slowed down and laughed at himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before this year I always thought that I really like the daughter of Earl Hall. She has perfect looks, elegant manners, rich property, a prominent family, and a very powerful father. This is a prince who is not critical of marriage, but I now understand that what really appeals to me, what I want to have even dreams of, is a unique temperament, and a deep heart that comes from experience. Oh, I am not saying that the lady of Earl’s family has no temperament. But that's not what I want, appreciate, like. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His prince, your tone, attitude, and expression are almost the same as Talim’s life... Don’t suddenly die in front of me, then I Jumping into the Tsock River can't wash the suspicion... And this kind of thing is too much, it's easy to be ruined, you want to tie me to your chariot... Klein is a little scared <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cleared his throat and took the initiative to open the subject:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, Your identity and status will definitely not lack subordinates. Some people are willing to investigate the death of Tallim for you. Why do you have to find me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edessack shook his head and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a big detective with the ability to have a brain, and have a good relationship with Talim. I was at the scene. I don't think anyone is more suitable than you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, if there is any problem, I can guarantee your safety. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This promise is like toilet paper in the bathroom... Kline can't help but swear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Prince Edsac has already said this to him. He feels that if he refuses, he will probably be inseparable from the Red Rose Manor and he will sigh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I am as angry as you are for Tallim's death, but the reality makes me only calm. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edsack reveals a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What help do you need from me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talim's hair, flesh and blood, choose one, plus his belongings. Klein made a request.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then I will let people send these things to your home." Edessack immediately agreed, then curiously asked, "Only these?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not polite:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I have a preliminary direction, I can know the need What kind of help? Your Royal Highness, you are best to give me a contact, a private detective always comes to this manor, certainly a doubt. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed Sack nodded and said as early as possible:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will Let people secretly rent the house next door to you, that is, No. 13 Minsk Street. When you need to contact, you will write a letter to visit the new neighbor and put it in the letter box. As for the reward, you should know that I am not a 吝啬People, even if they end up with no results, as long as you make a contribution, bear the risks, there will be corresponding income. If you do find out the truth, I will give you a reward that will allow you to support your old age. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prince is very resolutely popular... Pension, at least 3,000 pounds are up... Klein secretly sighs.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, let the spirit of Talim get peace in the country of storm and lightning. He bent over and bowed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edsac gently beheaded and told the old housekeeper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You take Moriatti detective out and send him back to Minsk Street. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not leave me for lunch? Is this attitude towards the guests too arrogant? Of course, the long time from noon is the main reason... Klein is silent He tweeted two sentences.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed the old housekeeper and went to the gate of the manor to retrieve the gun bag, revolver and bullets.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 15th Minsk Street, Klein stood in front of the belly window and watched the car with the royal family The coat of arms of the coat of arms is far away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really want to go deep into the investigation, Sherlock. Moriarty may be violent at any time... Now maybe some people are staring I am, um, not for the time being, after all, I have not started any action..." Klein frowned and stood still.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, He has an unprecedented urgency to promote "no face".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't just wait for the 'mechanical heart' to explore the mausoleum of the Amon family, and also in other channels. Following Try to buy properties of human skin Shadow, after all, who do not know 'mechanical heart' how long it will be ready in case more than one month, even more than half of it? This is not impossible. It is a very good strategy to send people to hold the entrance first, and then collect the corresponding information. It is a very good strategy. But then, I can't wait..." Klein thought and made up his mind. At 2:45 pm, he took the newspaper and entered the bathroom, actively preparing for the Tarot party this week.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep red and illusory radiance, Audrey Hall, looked around in a good mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, she finally got the coveted sequence of 7 "psychologist" potion formula, which still has the excitement, excitement and pragmatism, calm and mixed Feeling, and the psychological alchemy did not ask her to contribute immediately, saying it was an advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They fully believe that Miss Audrey has excellent "repayment" ability. There are no new members... "Justice" Audrey stood up and turned his attention to the top of the bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good afternoon, 'Mr. Fool'~ Good afternoon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is brisk and happy The voice broke the silence of the ancient sky, and Klein, who was somewhat depressed, temporarily got rid of the troubles of the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently decapitated and responded to the greetings of several members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After re-sitting, Audrey took the other members into the eye and formed a dynamic scene with the previously observed pictures:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the ceremony of Mr. "Down Hanging Man", he quietly looked at Mr. "The Fool" with a vague curiousness. Then he looked to Mr. "World". Expected...that is to say, he has a very close relationship with the Storm Church. He knows the detailed process of the assassination of the Duke of Nigan, and learned that the Grand Theft Auto has appeared, and explored the hidden truth behind this scene. Desire... The extraordinary character of the "werewolf" that Mr. "World" entrusted him to sell seems to have already produced results. He probably also found one of the characteristics of the shadow of the human skin and one of the two materials of the deep sea Naga... Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mood of the "Sun" is very stable and with a bit of ease, which shows that he believes that Baiducheng’s monitoring of him has been lifted... What does he rely on? Judging? Reorganized into the so-called exploration squad? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falth was a little depressed in relaxation... She became a student of the other through the test of the members of the Abraham family, but was forced to accept some What are your own disadvantages? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. "World" is as cold and deep as usual... Maybe I get sequence 7, or even sequence 6, to grasp his emotional changes and thoughts... Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔, "Folly" is still so mysterious, powerful, and unpredictable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of thoughts crossed the mind of "Justice" Audrey, and she looked into the shadowy figure:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, I got a new three-page Russell Diary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is her from "Psychological The alchemy club asked for a copy of it, because it was mentioned last night, the time was more rushed, and Isilant only had time to give her three pages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to pay?" Klein asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey answered sincerely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just be your answer to my question before Remuneration, can I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she said this, she was inexplicably showing off her feelings:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Upside down people", you still don't know the existence of "Twilight Hermits"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, really envious, Miss "Justice" I don’t know what questions I have asked privately... I will write to the teacher when I go back and ask if there is any Luo Searle's diary, no, to speak to the outside world, notes... "Magician" Foers suddenly had a desire and motivation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the suspicion of "downside down", Klein did not care to nod:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey quickly showed three pages of yellow-brown diaries and passed them on to Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
