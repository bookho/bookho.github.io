			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang, the bell pulled by the rope swayed and spread the sound throughout the spacious but relatively empty living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper and studying the investment opportunities. Klein stood up, white shirt with black vest, he did not tie the bow, very much Casual at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first single commission for my detective career? However, I can't always wait at home, waiting for the task to come to the door, um... I have to get a message book hanging at the door, with a water-absorbing pen, so that customers can write down the time of the visit again, let I am prepared in advance... But for a new detective who has no reputation for entering the market, basically it means that there is no next time... Hey, can only be a little troublesome, whether there is a commission on the day of divination every morning, about what time period To arrange this... Of course, this may miss the task of the power of the devotee, um, miss it and miss it, the big probability is good...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein wanted to walk to the door, without the need to pass the cat's eye, the image of the outside visitors naturally appeared in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is wearing black plush soft The old lady in the cap, her back is slightly awkward, her face is deep and wrinkled, her skin is dry and yellow, but the dark dress is officially decent and looks very neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her horns are all white, and the blue eyes are quite fascinating. At this time, the young man next to him is pointing to him to pull the doorbell again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man is in his 20s and has a pair of eyes similar to the old lady. In the increasingly cold weather, he is wearing a Bakerland gentleman class. The black double-breasted long dress, wearing a half-height silk hat, and a banquet-like bow tie, seems that no scene at any moment will relax the requirements of oneself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "joke" premonition ability, before the bell shakes again, Klein twists the handle and opens the door, smiling and greeting:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, madam, sir, today is a good day. I have seen the sun for five minutes until now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke the weather in a slightly exaggerated way, which is the popular topic of Beckland's popularity for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it is always shy to hide behind the fog and the clouds, and has been reluctant to come out." The old lady agreed to the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the young man asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Sherlock Morrie Yadi Detective?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, do you have anything to entrust? Sorry, please come in, let's talk to the sofa." Klein leaned over the body. , let the channel open, pointing to the area of ​​hospitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no." The old lady said sharply, "I don't want to waste a little time, my poor Brody is still waiting." I am saving it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It?" Klein noticed the most important pronoun, and suddenly had a bad feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people who dress very formalally must nod their heads:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brodi is my grandmother A cat raised by Ms. Lisi, it was lost last night, I hope you can help us find it, we live at the end of this street, I am willing to pay 5 Soules for this, of course, if you In the end, I can prove that you have spent more time and energy than this category, and I will compensate you extra."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking for a cat? The reason why I entrusted me is because it is in the same street, very convenient... Klein thinks this is not the detective career he imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes me look like a clown... Well, the first business to open the door can’t be turned down. This is from the divination’s point of view... He’s indulged A few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you describe it in detail?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old too much Lisi grabs Before the young man spoke, he said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brodi is a cute, lively black cat, it is very healthy, with a pair of beautiful green eyes. I like to eat cooked chicken breast, goddess, it left like that last night, no, it must be lost, I put a lot of chicken breasts in its bowl, it is not willing to come back and take a look." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... Klein's mouth is upturned: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very satisfied with your description, Mrs. Doris."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I accept this commission, ok, go to your home now, I need to find clues and find traces, you should be very clear, the core of reasoning lies in the details."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Doris did not consult her grandson and immediately nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the most active detective I have ever seen. , Deal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein put on his coat, put on his hat, picked up his cane, and followed Ms. Doris and her grandson to the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Tingen, the roads in many areas of Beckland have been rebuilt with cement or asphalt, and even in the rainy weather, it will not be so muddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the opportunity of the old lady to walk ahead, his grandson got to Klein and pressed down the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that you can do your best to find Brody."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since my grandfather and parents have passed away, it It has become one of the pillars of my grandmother's life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When Brody lost, my grandmother’s spirit had problems and even produced auditory hallucinations. Tell me that she heard poor Brody screaming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein solemnly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I will try my best, right, I don't know how to call you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Urgen, Jurgen Cooper, one a senior attorney," the young man replied. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, they came to 58 Minsk Street and entered a dark-stained house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Brodie's bowl, this is its favorite box, it always sleeps here." Doris is full of wrinkled face Filled with two emotions of worry and expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stumbled and found several black cat hairs from the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He straightens his body and holds the silver-plated cane with the hand holding the cat's hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s eyes turned deep, pretending to look around, silently chanting the divination statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand quietly left the head but did not completely detach, so that both Jurgen and Doris could not notice the fact that the cane was standing on its own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the black silver-plated cane slanted to the side, the speed of the dumping was very slow and the amplitude was small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein held the rod again, looked at that direction and observed it for ten seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he stepped forward and walked over to an old cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you find traces of Brody's departure?" Jurgen asked with concern, and too much old lady was waiting for the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t answer, half awkward, and opened the bottom door of the cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black cat smashed out from the inside, and the tail cocked up to its bowl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brodi...when did you get into the cupboard? How could you be locked in the cupboard?" Mrs. Doris shouted in surprise and confusion. Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgan looked sideways and looked at Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know it? In the cupboard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiled and replied in a low voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Reasoning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
