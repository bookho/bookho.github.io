			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black "spiritual line" from different life appeared in Kline's eyes, but he did not immediately extend his self-spirituality to try to manipulate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After identifying and confirming which "spiritual line" belongs to Mosona, he sipped his mouthful of malt beer and focused on the boxing match on the stage. Like a real audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two boxers were naked, not wearing any protective gear, playing very hard, they collided constantly, punched to the flesh, and the situation quickly became fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of drunken gamblers watched the adrenaline secretion, enthusiastically shouted the name of the boxer that he supported, and shouted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dry and die this scorpion!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second floor, Mosona also forgot the cigar in his hand, and looked at the platform below, and one hand had clenched his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around him, in addition to being responsible for guarding the surrounding suspicious people and other important areas such as the roof downstairs, so that they have to guard their bodyguards, attention Inevitably placed in the bloody boxing match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein raised his hand again and sipped his beer, seemingly a little breathless because of the tight atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, his spirituality quietly spread out and seized the unreal black line corresponding to Mossona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One second, two seconds, three seconds... Mossona of the rosacea just wanted to move his fists in a small amount, just like he was fighting in the ring. The head suddenly turned into wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt that the scenes around him became a bit strange, as if several layers of thick glass were added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mossona immediately found that his thoughts were obviously stagnant, and all the parts in his head seemed to suddenly rust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the goal is just an ordinary person, the spiritual strength is far less than the extraordinary one. Klein did not use 20 seconds to initially control the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 seconds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only 7 seconds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops...The problem is... It should be...Competitive ability...Special...extraordinary...Mossona, often with pirates, mysterious The world is no stranger, so it will cost you a lot of money to protect yourself. If you don't get rid of the body early, the spirit is weak, the state has been bad, and the probability of taking the potion is out of control. He wants to let himself Get the supernatural power directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, because of the stagnation and inexperience, Mosona took more than a dozen seconds to figure out that he had been attacked, and immediately stretched his arms, Zhang Open your mouth and try to call for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his movements are so slow, the voice in his throat is so weak, and the bodyguards around him are watching the intense and intense boxing intently. In the game, the audience’s cry was higher than the waves, and the attention of the outside guards was in the place where the attack might occur. The employers in the non-heavy protection were obviously ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the climax of the game has subsided for a while, some bodyguards and their men look back at the boss, they can only see that Mossona’s eyes are a bit sluggish, and the position of the hands is not Too normal, it seems to be still immersed in the boxing match, and anxiously awaiting the final result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gangster’s eyes burst into tears, trying to loosen the five fingers, trying to get the cigars to land and attract attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is desperate to find that his thinking is getting slower and stiffer, and a simple action seems to take more than a minute to complete, and his The finger is still fighting against his thoughts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning cigar finally fell to the floor, and Mossona’s tears fell along his face and slipped on his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several bodyguards found this thing, just asked if the head was too excited because of the game, Mosona suddenly buried, rubbing his face I picked up the cigar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This game is good! Add money to the final winner!" Mosona played the cigar, pulled the collar, and opened a smiley arc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t specifically say how much to add, because Klein didn’t understand the market at all, so he could only vaguely explain it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Mossona of the "New Lun Party" has become his embarrassment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the gangster is just an ordinary person, the spirit is even weaker than normal humans, so he only spent two minutes and fifteen seconds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the time required is a little longer, he will be distracted to create confusion with illusion, so that the bodyguards can only protect Mosona, and it is too late to find his abnormality. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience’s shouts were suddenly neat, and the contest on the ring came to an end, and Mosona also gestured to the bodyguards. Continue to watch the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a boxer fell unconsciously, Mossona took a cigar:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Go to the room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to take a break. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the head (the boss). His bodyguards and his men immediately surrounded him into the corridor on the second floor, helping him open the door of the lounge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commanded the guards to hold the key positions, not After coming in and disturbing himself, Mossona took a few steps back and forth, opened the safe, found a document involving new drugs, and screened out the most important ones.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he put the documents and the address slips cut from the newspaper, together with a total of £758 in cash, into a briefcase.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, he opened the door and called a man:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Throw the bag under the third streetlight in the corner lane. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, head. "His men did not ask why.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the rule!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-close the door, Mo Sona turned to find three candles and spiritual objects, and used a white paper pen to carefully depict the badge corresponding to the "fool" - half of the "innocent eye" symbolizing the hidden and half of the "distorted line symbolizing the change" "Special symbol of composition.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, this gangster who has become a gangster, lit candles, used perfume instead of essential oils and pure dew, and prayed earnestly The ritual given.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He whispered the name of the "fool" and recited the corresponding mantra in the ancient Hermes language, which was not at all, and then Pick up spiritual items, let it blend into the wind, and build a illusory door with the changing candlelight - if you don't find something rich in spirituality, Klein's plan is to use Mosona's blood, the human blood itself is A spiritual thing!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first floor washroom, Klein grabs An opportunity to go back four steps and come to the fog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not use the "Black Emperor" card, directly inciting a little bit of this mysterious space Strength, connect them with the paper people, and shake into the door of sacrifice and giving.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper man immediately turns into an angel with twelve pairs of wings. Flying over the illusory mysterious door, through the dark and deep void, arrived at Mosona.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a possible divination, prophecy and other extraordinary Capability survey!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Klein picked up "squirming hunger" and threw it into the ceremonial gate!<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Squirming Hunger" came to the real world with a ritual of praying, and came to Mosona, and for a long time it did not eat, it suddenly moved!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Klein also returned to the bathroom, again separated by a few tens of meters, manipulating the formerly froze Mosona closed his mouth and picked up " . & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp gloves on the table "<br <br /> & nbsp />;The center of the glove immediately split a gap, there are two rows of illusory, white teeth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s sensation was quickly weakened, and he dismissed control when he made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slight reflexes made his head dizzy, but it didn't take long to return to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he didn’t happen anything, left the bathroom, went back to the bar, and continued to drink the malt that he hadn’t finished before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he used the "spirit of the spirit" to find a mouse on the second floor, which made the other party become less than two minutes later. puppet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mouse movement is a bit awkward and unskilled to find caves and roads, it took a certain amount of time to get shelter from the bookshelf and enter the rest of Mosona room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the floor is lying quietly with a thin glove made of human skin, and Mosona has no residue left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouse climbed onto the table, picked up the paper with the symbol of "fool" and put it in front of the burning candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper was quickly ignited and turned into ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After extinguishing the three candles and returning them to their original place, the mouse came to the "squirming hunger" and picked up the glove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, it returned the same way and left Mosona’s lounge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It lurked all the way to the balcony on the second floor, and climbed silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first floor, the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein drank the last bite of beer, put down the cup, and slowly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed the half-height silk hat and put his hands in the pockets of the black double-breasted long dress, and the pace was not too slow to cross the drunk gamblers. Going to the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the light of the gas streetlight, he came to the corner lane normally, and pulled out the paper man, ignited and lit, and picked up the third street light pole. Under the briefcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a gray mouse licked the thin human leather gloves and smashed it from the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein bent over again with a blank expression and picked up "squirming hunger." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the gray mouse went away on his own, climbed into a rubbish bin, lay there and completely lost his breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night that has already arrived, Klein, who shines in the gas streetlight, stands there, and does not panic to open his fingers, will "squirming hunger" I got my left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lower finger joint and adapted to the lower glove. He licked his briefcase and disappeared at the intersection of the street after the still lively and energetic "Oak Bar". . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put a briefcase with only important information on it After the address bar and stamps were placed in the postbox on the corner, Klein turned back to Galman Sparo, took the rental carriage and went to another bar in the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a bar with more pirates from Anderson! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the bar, Klein swept his eyes and put the general look inside into his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw a familiar figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure is medium in shape, purple in lips, and brown eyes contain a strong and fearful fear. It is the "King of Undead" Agarito's second Deputy, the £9,500 "slayer" Gilhies! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, after fleeing from the dangerous sea area, the "death" came to the nearest island of Toskat, seeking resupply! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have come... Klein’s mouth is slightly ticked and found that there is no more suitable hunting “devil” than chance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
