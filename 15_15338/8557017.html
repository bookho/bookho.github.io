			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pavo Cote...Crivis did not respond directly to the woman behind the telegraph office, turned to look at German Sparrow and waited He made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of this former adventurer, a group of more than a dozen people wanting to return to the "White Onyx" safely and smoothly is a very difficult thing in itself. Can't and should not be distracted to find someone at this time, but he is also very clear that the current pillar is Galman Sparo and "flame" Daniz, who have promised or not agreed. that power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was silent for two seconds, and his voice was not high and not low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is long What does it look like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks that he has more information to help get rid of this strange and foggy city, so he asked if he would help. Look at what will happen next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time as the inquiry, Klein warned himself not to go too far, otherwise it would easily ignite the danger hidden in Banxi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In understanding the situation and avoiding risks, he must be like a balance beam, no more, no left, no right, no bias. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be easy or difficult, because no one knows what to do if you step on it, you can only make judgments based on experience and intuition, and you may fall at any time. The pit, which makes Klein's spirit highly tense, and his thoughts are unprecedentedly quick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness and thin fog, the telegraph’s door was still closed, and the woman inside paused:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a very handsome man.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has two eyes, two ears, one nose, one mouth. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer is so horrible... This woman’s fear is not a problem too? According to the custom of Banxi, she should not respond at all! "Daniz is very open to the door and rushes into the telegraph office to check the impulses inside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw German. Paro raised his hand and pressed his hat and turned to the side.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Storage Church. Klein said the destination shortly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t care what the woman in the telegraph office had, just like not going to explore the owner of the lime restaurant. The secrets of the diners staying in the same place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is getting smaller and smaller, the fog is thin, and the candlelight in the church is faint from the narrow windows of the heights. It shines like a lighthouse in the storm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Klein once again used the "sun ring", Donna and others regained some courage, just like falling water People, desperately grabbing the last straw, quietly and hurriedly walking on the streets without passers-by.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, they arrived outside the storm church, But the two doors were tightly closed, and there was no gap.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the eye of the storm, Klein raised his hand and knocked three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚!咚!咚!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door, a slightly vigilant male voice was heard: <br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German Sparo. Klein replied directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has heard it, and asked Captain Ireland,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Why are you here? "Alan didn't open the door and asked again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein said with a cane, calmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You paid for me to compensate for the white shark." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still hesitated until Krivis, Uldi Blanche, Donna and others made a sound, and then let go of their hearts, let the first officer Harris unlock the lock and open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy ties were far away, and Klein saw a boat-shaped cap, a straight sword in one hand, and a sleek Airland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is also a problem here?" He asked sharply in light of the previous situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erlan first sideways let Donna and others enter, and then point to the prayer hall:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The priest Jess I know died inside, the head and the body are separated, and the bishop Miller does not know where to go, and the other pastors are also, and the servants in the church are gone."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A priest died and a bishop disappeared? The entire church lost its living? The problem is a bit big... Klein is holding a cold Azick copper whistle, and his heart is getting more and more condensed. Of course, he is very clear that the pastor and the bishop are not the main force of the storm church management Ban Xigang extraordinary event, in the underground of this church, there must be 6~ The "offenders" team of eight extraordinary people, as well as the variable number of seals, even if the high sequence is strong, may not be able to solve this force in a short period of time with little or no movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as they are still alive and can use seals, the problem will not be too bad... So, at this time, what is the "Prisoner" team doing? According to the experience of the former night-timers, Klein started from the normal processing flow and made a guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, he followed Elland to the Great Prayer Hall and examined the body of the pastor who died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jes is deadly, like being alive and being cut off from his head. Unlike the monsters outside, his esophagus and head are separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Kline’s vision, the pastor has no remaining spirits, and even if he wants to be psychic, it is difficult to succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the special murder method itself, or did it deal with it... Unlike the monsters outside, is it because the hands are too hasty? Klein completed the previous guess based on the situation at the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks there are two possibilities. One is that a piece of underground origin, a living seal or a sequence of extraordinary people is out of control, fleeing into the church, running Going out and solving Jess on the way, causing the change of Banxi Port, the bishops, pastors and "penalties" are trying to search for catching up, to re-complete the seal and clear, the servants are introduced into a certain area of ​​the ground, Protected by the “detainee” who stays behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not explain the strange performance of the residents of Bansin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second possibility is that the original sacrifice of the "God of the Weather" is revived in some people in Banxi, and the flying head and the headless monster are in line with the sacrifice. Sharing the flesh and blood, burying the head in the description of the altar, and based on some temporarily unknown reason, this part of the people raided the church and killed the pastor Jess. The rest of the residents knew more or less, but they chose silence. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may have broken into the ground, fighting with the punters, pastors, and bishops with the help of seals, and turning all the servants into monsters, or maybe Was pushed back, was being chased by the extraordinary people of the storm church, all the way to escape, the servants entered the ground, accept protection, prevent accidents... From the body of Jess was not used, the big probability is the latter development ...... This time to go underground to confirm the situation, will certainly be attacked, after all, is stranger and extraordinary... And, the strength of staying behind may not be enough... Klein looked at the pastor lying on the ground and found that his extraordinary characteristics have been condensed The neck is like a blue gem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He regained his gaze, did not pick up, did not want to provoke the mad revenge of the violent old brothers of the storm church, and turned to Allan and the first officer Harris Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First return to the ship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the gold coins and confirmed There is no battle under the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of how, whether or not there is a "penalty" left behind, the ground floor of the church is no longer suitable for long-term stay, after all, Kline is not sure of his own guess It must be correct and only the safest choice can be made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he returns to the "White Onyx", he has many sailors and many sailors who can resist a certain degree of accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a little rest, the group left the Storm Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the addition of Airland and Harris, the defense around the team is obviously stricter. Klein does not need to throw a copper whistle to attract monsters. It was put in the pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do we want to send a telegram to the Storm Church headquarters to report on the situation in Banxi?" Alan took a few steps and Elland made a careful proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, even if there is a big change, as long as you stick to it, you will always be saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein has no objection, walking in the mist in front, calmly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passing the telegraph office."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, "flame" Daniz first breathed a sigh of relief, and immediately raised a heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was afraid that the Storm Church sent people to investigate the whole thing and found that a famous pirate played an important role in it, and at that time, he was likely to be still sleepy. On the "White Onyx". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I saved people, the "penalty" is not friendly to the kind that belongs to them, especially I am still a pirate...Danizi is in a dilemma I decided to put the danger in front of me in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked for a while, seeing the Telegraph Bureau looking forward, but suddenly there was a dim light on the side of the street, coming from the depths of the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a middle-aged man carrying a lantern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was wearing a dark blue bishop's robe embroidered with a storm symbol, his head was low, his face was pale, his breath was short, and his footsteps were awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan is stunned and shouted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Miller?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man looked up and raised the horse: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are, Airland ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Klein took a step back, highlighting the position of Elland and not allowing the bishop of the Storm Church to value himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz has shrunk his neck and blocked himself with the fat body of Uldi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Mr. Bishop, I saw Jess dead, what happened?" Elland was not a newbie and did not directly greet him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Miller coughed two channels:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ancient customs are recovering, a group of streams The cultists with dirty blood began to sacrifice with the living and shared flesh and blood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jess found their problems and was killed by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things are no longer obscured. They used sacrifices, changed the weather, tried to attack the church, were defeated by the punishers, fled to the mountains, and fled to the cave where the altar was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was injured in the battle, I couldn’t hold it, I could only return slowly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice just fell, and a burst of bright light burst out in the fog in the distance, just like there are countless lightnings entangled under his arm.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such light, Klein and others saw the shoreline covered by fog and saw the peak connected to the thunderstorm scene.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This confirms to some extent the bishop of Miller.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan is about to step up to help the storm The bishop, however, saw that Gelman Sparrow had a gold coin and whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
