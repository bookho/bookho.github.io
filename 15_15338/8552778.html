			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merso’s body lay there, his eyes round, and there seemed to be fierce light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wound that cut off half of the throat was originally a thin one, but with the cohesion of extraordinary characteristics, it has been a lot bigger and more blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the incontinence after death made him a stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein held the group of deep red jellies, and he was full of embarrassed feelings about what to do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the big direction, his choices are nothing more than three kinds. One is to clean up the scene, handle the wounds, and go to the streets in the name of legitimate defense. Second, Wait until the night, throw the body into a sewer, pretend that nothing happened, and the third is to immediately give up the current identity, flee to other districts, and rename the name again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first option is that Klein is still a black family, and there are secrets that are not visible, and the alarm is easy for him to be investigated. In addition to making him worry about the body being discovered, the police came to the door and there was another danger:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambassador behind Mersor confirmed After missing or dying, he will definitely send someone to Minsk Street No. 15, when Klein may encounter sequence 7, or even the enemy of sequence 6 - the country behind him may be a country. A strong country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third option seems to be the most sensible and safest, escaping all the risks, but there is also a downside, that is, Klein’s portrait is likely to be wanted. Order, and it is also in the eyes of Mrs. Summer, the neighbor, Mr. Jurgen, and others. Without disguise, when the corresponding newspaper is released, even if it is limited to the Big Bakerland, Klein is likely to be When Dai Li is worthy of the night, the problem becomes bigger and more troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the involvement of Ins. Zangweier, involving the seal "0-08", he is highly likely to be pursued by the senior deacon level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the third option has a branch that hides the body, throws evidence into the sewer, and then flees, but it is also wanted. Danger, because the opposite ambassador can not instruct the members of the Zmang party to call the police in the absence of a person, and use the official forces of Beckland to search - if he can lock Klein’s whereabouts, things will develop. Equivalent to the second option. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about it, Klein quickly made a decision:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divination...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there is already a tendency in his heart, that is, the two evils are taken lightly. The first option is relatively less risky, and it can grasp the initiative to some extent. And through exposure, by attracting the attention of the official forces, the follow-up actions of the ambassador are suppressed, not too crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn out the paper and write the divination statement. Klein untied the spirit in the left wrist cuff, letting the citrine pendant fall naturally and almost touch the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should call the police."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should call the police."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After meditation, he saw that the spirit was turning clockwise, not too small, and faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means a considerable degree of certainty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In turn, divination of the other two options, after getting a negative answer, Klein no longer hesitated to start dealing with the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put on black gloves, searched the body of Mersor, found a sharp dagger, a stack of cash, a box of cigarettes, As well as a lighter, some sundries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein put everything else back, took off the gloves, held the dagger directly, and pierced it into the throat of Melso’s throat. Destroy the original shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Klein collected Mercer's extraordinary characteristics, homemade spells, tarot cards, blood-stained contracts, papers for writing divination statements, and various materials from his body, and put them in paper bags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he held his own "call" ceremony and became a special spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When carrying the Aziz copper whistle to make himself stronger and stronger, Klein picked up the paper bag, ended the summoning, and returned to the fog. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He temporarily placed those real objects behind the "fool" high back chair, and left the Aziz copper whistle, then easily simulated The feeling of falling down and re-entering the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Klein did not burn the blood-stained contract and the paper for writing divination was because after worrying about the alarm, things were transferred to special departments. Strong and extraordinary people come to carry out targeted divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once there is a barrier to fog, even if the eternal sun comes, it will not get a valid answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the reason for the promotion sequence 8, after the spirituality has been greatly improved, Klein will put the weekly combing and summary on the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't stand the big suspicions and in-depth investigations now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the spiritual wall, let the sudden wind blow away the remnants of the ritual material, and Klein and the whole room are related to the extraordinary and mysterious fields. The only thing left is the candle burning in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, he chose ordinary candles, but he prayed to himself and summoned himself. There is no need to pay attention to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in a family, having a candle is very reasonable and normal is very suitable for the times, even if there is only one bachelor in the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After extinguishing the candle and putting it back in place, Klein took out the golden pocket watch and glanced openly to estimate that Mersor died How many minutes ago, and added the minimum time spent by the police department to send inquiries and report at the level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to make sure that even if there are extraordinary people to investigate, Melso’s death time has passed an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In occultism, in the field of psychic, this is an important time node. Exceeding it, the information available is quite limited and very vague. For example, the person who can kill Mersor by killing is "Sherlock Moratti", but can't get the specific details of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether the other party may be involved in the hidden dangers of extraordinary factors, Klein is not worried at all, because the main superfluous factors involved (the blood-stained standard contract) are in the fog. Above...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his own hunch and the ability to fight will be confused - the other's divination will definitely point to the mysterious space above the fog Will definitely be disturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, I am also professional... I feel like Moriati... Klein revisited the scene and confirmed that there was no problem, then I started staring. The pocket watch pointer ticks around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the estimated limit, he put on the gold-rimmed glasses and waited a few more minutes before he came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Beckland’s sky is already dark, and the gas lamps on the street illuminate the rainy and rainy environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minsk Street As a middle-class neighborhood, police officers often patrol, and Klein waited for a while, then found the target and immediately greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two police officers with only one V in the epaulettes. They are holding guns, carrying short sticks, holding umbrellas, and looking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police! There are gangsters attacking me!" Klein shouted skillfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of his wolverine made the two police officers not dare to neglect, each took out a short stick and watched the side to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pointed to his house road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He sneaked into my home and wanted to kill me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"In the fight, I accidentally stabbed him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stabbed... the two police officers looked at each other and reviewed Looking to Klein Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take us in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!" Klein pretended to be the rest of his life. He led two police officers to No. 15 Minsk Street, took out the key and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two police officers first saw the messy scene, then noticed the lying body lying on the ground, noticed the wound in the throat of the other party, noticed a Put the bloody dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You protect the scene, I report back to the police station." Another police officer said to the round-faced companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." The round-faced police officer turned his attention to Klein, and his expression and body language revealed his alert and beware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, wearing a black and white uniform, the policeman with three V shoulders led the previous police officer and two other subordinates to arrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police officers inspected the scene and collected clues while the sheriff with a brownish short beard took Klein aside and made preliminary Ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock. Moriarty, here is me The rent bill for half a year." Klein took out the things that had been prepared long ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheriff took a casual look and continued to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What occupation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Private detective." Klein calmly replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheriff frowned and said, "Do you know the dead? Do you know why he is going to attack you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know him, he is called Mersoe, the sentence of the Zangger party." Klein waited for the other party to ask again, said, "I have accepted a commission from Ian. Wright, he asked me to investigate his former employer, Detective Sweeper Victor Lee, which happened to be related to the Zimmergg party and to Mersor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I followed the other person and found that he and a very famous gentleman met in secret. He called the other party the ambassador." After saying this, Klein did not accidentally see the sheriff's face changing. under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ambassador... know his name?" the sheriff said to himself, hesitating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, but if I see his photo, I can definitely recognize it." Klein said the truth, "Merso came to visit this morning. I, let me look for Ian Wright, based on the professional ethics of private detectives, I refused him. As a result, in the evening, when I first returned home, I was attacked and almost killed by him. Fortunately, my The fighting level is not bad, and the reaction is also alert enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheriff pondered for a moment and asked about the specific fighting process. Klein was almost originally described locally. At most, the hunch was changed into a reaction, and the last thrown contract was changed to the dagger of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well...you first go back to the police station with us, waiting for the results of the autopsy, the conclusion of the site investigation and the inquiry to the relevant person." The sheriff’s mind seems to It is no longer a perfunctory thing on this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has only one idea today:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important case involving foreign ambassadors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must report it immediately! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 恍惚, he suddenly remembered a question and quickly added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
