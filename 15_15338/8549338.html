I don’t know how to spit... He shakes his head and laughs, picks up the stairs, stretches out his right hand, and taps the half-covered door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slow and rhythmic knocking of the door echoed, but there was no response in the house, only the movement of "哒哒哒" faintly came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein repeated it again, still the same result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He changed his mind to push, let the gap grow bigger, his eyes followed, and saw a group of classical sofas and soft-faced chairs that I don’t know if it was for reception. And the wood-colored coffee table, I saw a table directly opposite, and the head behind the table was drooping, little brown-haired girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the "security company" brand is only disguised, but it is too much, too "professional", right? How long has this been without business? Ok, you don't need any business... Klein squats and leans closer, on the table, in the girl's ear, knocking twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown-haired girl sat up straight, grabbed the newspaper in front of her hands and slammed her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tingen City Honest Man"... Good name... Klein silently looked up at the newspaper facing his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The steam train 'Flying' in Conston City is open today... Really, when can I go directly to Desi Bay, I don't want to take the boat again. Going, it’s too uncomfortable, very uncomfortable... Hey, who are you?” The brown-haired girl read aloud and made a comment, and said, she lowered the newspaper, revealing a smooth forehead and light brown eyes. Hey, first of all, please, then look at Klein in a wrong way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, I am Klein Moretti, at the invitation of Mr. Dunn Smith." Klein took off the hat and put it on the chest. Before, slightly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown-haired girl looks like she is in her early 20s, wearing a light green Lun style light dress with beautiful lace on the cuffs, neckline, chest and other places. Set off her face more and more good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain... well, you are waiting here, I will ask him." The girl hurriedly got up and entered the room from the side door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not say that the glass of water or something... The service consciousness is worrying... Klein smiled, waiting in the same place, not going to the sofa and chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two or three minutes, the brown-haired girl pushed the door out and smiled sweetly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Moretti, trouble you to follow me, the captain is on duty today 'Channis Gate' and can't leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein and 煦 煦, I was guilty in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanis Gate, what is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the partition, the first thing that comes into his eyes is a long corridor, and the three offices are left and right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These offices are tightly locked, some are open, and people inside can be seen knocking on the heavy mechanical typewriter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a glance, Klein found an acquaintance: the young police officer who searched his family that day, black and blue, with the poet's romantic temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t wear formal attire, his white shirt didn’t get into his trousers, and he’s like a wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps he is really a poet... Klein bowed his head and the other person smiled back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown-haired girl twisted the handle of the left office at the end, pushed the door open and pointed at the inside and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“There are a few more stairs.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no item in this office, only the gray stone steps extend down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls on both sides of the stairs are lined with elegant gas lamps, and the steady light dispels the darkness and brings peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown-haired girl walks in front, staring at her feet, walking cautiously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I often go here, but I am still scared. I always worry about falling and rolling down. You don’t know, Leonard has done this stupid thing. He was not fully mastered on the first day of becoming a 'sleeper’. On the first day of his own strength, he tried to run at the speed of sprinting. Then, he became a wheel. Haha, it’s funny to think of it. Well, that guy who just greeted you, it’s all three years ago. It’s a matter of saying, I’ve been in the night for five years, when I was only seventeen years old...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girls look at the road while they come to the ground Suddenly, she took a forehead in a covert way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forgetting to introduce myself, my name is Luo Shan, my father is a formal member of the night, five years I was sacrificed in an accident. We should be colleagues in the future. Hey, you should use the word 'colleagues'... it’s not a teammate. After all, we are not extraordinary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope to have this honor, but in the end I have to see what Mr. Smith said." Klein looked around the closed. Only two people began to enter the bottom of the earth - the stone wall infiltrated the cold and wet, dispelling the heat of summer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, you can come directly here, indicating that the captain agreed, I have always been afraid of the captain, although he is very kind, very caring, giving my father The feeling, but I don’t know why, it’s fear.” The voice of Luo Shan’s voice is like a piece of candy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein humor responded: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are afraid that father is not normal?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It makes sense." Rosanne reached out to the wall at the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the conversation, the two walked through the ladder that circling down to the flat ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a long aisle with gas lamps surrounded by metal grids on both sides of the wall, swaying underneath, Klein and Rosanne The shadow is long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein keenly noticed that there is a "dark sacred emblem" at every other distance on the wall, which is the symbol of the goddess of the night - "deep black璀璨 璀璨 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Ning He, Luo Shan also closed his mouth, no longer chatting as if chatting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, a crossroad appeared in front, and the brown-haired girl briefly introduced:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Go to the left to the Church of St. Serena, to the right is the library of weapons, materials and literature, go straight to the Chanis Gate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Selina Church? Is Zoeterland Street on the back of Red Moon Street? Klein couldn't stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Moon Street St. Serena Church is the headquarters of the Night Goddess Church in Tingen, a sacred place that local devotees aspire to, and steam in the suburbs Together with the Church of the Spirit of God, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Church of the Lord of the Storm, located in the northern district of Tingen, supports the religious community of Tingen and its affiliated towns and villages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, the current identity is not suitable for asking. Klein just listened silently and did not say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the crossroads, go straight ahead, less than a minute, a black iron with seven holy emblems on the door opens in two In front of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stands there, intuitively giving a heavy, cold and looking down feeling, like a giant guarding the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chanis Gate." Luo Shan said, pointing to the room next to the room. "The captain is inside, you go in."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, trouble you." Kline politely replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room that Luo Shan pointed out was just in front of the "Chanis Gate". The window was open and there was a light coming out. Klein took a breath and calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚! Boom! Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in." Dunn Smith’s low and screaming voice came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gently pushed open the hidden door and saw that there was only one table and four chairs in it, and the high-profile line of Dunn Smith was wearing last night. The black trench coat, read the newspaper leisurely, with a gold bracelet near the button on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sit down, think about it? Are you sure to join us?" Dunn put down the newspaper at hand and asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took off his hat, took a gift, sat down at the table and slowly nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, I am sure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you look at this contract, huh, now everyone likes to call the contract." Dunn opened the table drawer, Take out two copies of the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many of the above terms, which are mostly those that Dunn Smith said before, focusing on the confidentiality clause, and the violators no longer pass the kingdom court. It is directly tried by the arbitral tribunal of the Church of the Night God, just like soldiers and military officers have to go to military courts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five-year contract... Two pounds 10 Sule's weekly salary, 10 Sule's confidentiality and risk subsidies... Klein finished reading one by one, and the correct answer: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then sign it." Dunn pointed Dark red pen and ink path on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein tried the pen with waste paper first, then took a sigh of relief and signed his name in the corresponding position of the two contracts: Ryan Moretti. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only press the fingerprint because he has not yet stamped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun retracted the contract and took a seal from the drawer, covering the end and several key points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, he stood up and handed back a contract with one hand and reached for Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome, from now on, you are one of us, and note that the contract must be kept confidential."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein follows up, While picking up the contract, holding the other hand's hand and laughing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, should I call your captain?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Dunn's gray eyes are unusually quiet in a dimly lit environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the handshake, the two sat down separately, and Klein glanced at the seal on the contract and found the text to be "the city of Thuringen in the county of Rouen Squad." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to use the "Black Thorough Security Company" to cover it." He smiled casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually, we have another sign." Dunn took a piece of paper from the drawer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a double seal of the city government and the police department. The content is two lines of words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The seventh group of the Special Operations Department of the Ahowa County Police Department of the Kingdom of Rou.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The first four groups are normal police officers who undertake security, such as the Member Protection Team. , the important site protection group, etc., and from the fifth group, for the supernatural events of the various cities in the county, our seventh group is responsible for the events related to the goddess believers in Tingen City, if there are different believers, according to the geographical division We are mainly in the North District, the West District and the Jintongtong District."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun En probably introduced, "Subordinate to the Church of the Storm" The sixth team of the team is responsible for the terminal area, the eastern and southern areas, the fifth group of the university area and the suburbs, which is the squad of 'Mechanical Heart' in Tingen.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Klein couldn’t find anything to ask about this, and smiled. "If this is really because of 'black ? & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp spine security companies' sign-site delegate tasks, how to do "<br <br /> & nbsp />;</div>
