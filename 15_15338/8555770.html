When Mr. Inverted Man explained the common sense of various forces, he did not mention even a little..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey is stunned and confused. Immediately, the fog was faded, and the figure of Mr. Fool’s condescending disappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned slightly and quickly guessed:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This organization called "The Twilight Hermit Society" sounds more mysterious than the underground forces such as "Aurora" and "Life School", and is even less well known, so that it is rich in knowledge. Knowledgeable, "dumping people" who are closely related to the Storm Church do not know its existence...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their planned actions directly point to the kingdom The great aristocrat, one of the most powerful little monks in the world...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may be the deepest observers in the world, the real manipulators, influence It is no wonder that the situation in the North and the South is being watched by Mr. Fool...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; The last time the "upside down man" asked his beggar to help succeed, not because the promised reward was rich enough, but that the "fool" himself was targeting the "dusk hermit"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This organization is as mysterious as our "Tarot Club"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey is a little excited, this fades The impact of the death of the Duke of Nigan was brought to her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are certainly not many people who know the existence of the Twilight Hermitage, and I am one of them. And we Tarot will be targeting them! "Audrey stood up and walked over to the full body mirror.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her chin was slightly elevated with a slight curvature.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the young girl in the mirror, Audrey slowly calmed down, and for the first time, the elements of interest were urgently raised to improve her own sequence:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The stern under the strict protection of the Duke of Nigan will be assassinated, not to mention the father of ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although judging from the situation in the treasure house, there must be many extraordinary people in the family, and the Goddess Church will provide additional protection, but this still does not make people Rest assured, the Duke of Nigan's Guard is no worse than this...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Refueling, Audrey, as soon as possible to the sequence 7, sequence 6, hidden in the dark, do Dad , Mom, my brother's last line of defense! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital of the Rhodes Islands, the city of generosity.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Blue Avenger" once again passed by here, anchored at the port, giving sailors the opportunity to indulge and vent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Alger Wilson replaced the robes embroidered with storm patterns and came to the church on the island's largest church, the Wave Church.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is classically styled and extensive Use stone pillars and arches, and have a towering large dome and two bell towers<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-In the early days of colonization, those pioneers often did not have time to build churches. They have extremely serious consequences.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are surrounded by tribes, jungles, and ancient buildings, and even if they have conquered the locals, they often die mysteriously. There is no reason to die, and a large piece of land will die.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation caused great panic in the churches of major churches After that, it gradually decreased and became something that happened occasionally.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing at the door of the church, Alger did not rush into, but narrowed through the heights The light shining through the window, examining the dark and mysterious atmosphere inside, and the warm candlelight that illuminates the human activity area.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, he Step into the big prayer hall, hold the right fist, hit the left chest, and face the bishop of your own:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The storm is with you! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The storm is with you!" The bishop responded to him in the same position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Alger opened, the bishop of the Wave Church took out a telegram:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are just right, the cardinal meeting has issued an order, and then prayed after reading."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What order?" Alger reached out and asked. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop’s expression is dignified and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”The Duke of Nigan was assassinated, the cardinal conference let all The punishers and priests pay attention to the situation related to the Grand Theft Auto 'Black Emperor' and all the events involving the Tarot ritual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grand Theft" Black Emperor?" Jay fully expressed his surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He already knows that the "black emperor" is the leader of Mr. "fool". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop solemnly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The assassination of the Duke of Nigan is a sequence of 5 devils, But this demon was killed on the way to the runaway by the Grand Theft Auto 'Black Emperor', which is the same as the hurricane lieutenant 'Qilings' who killed the Duke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;not just the external form of expression, even the essence is the same... Killing Zilingers is also the leader of Mr. "The Fool", another leader... really wants the Duke of Nigan to die Is the "fool" Mr.? No, if it is He, the last time I will remind Zilingers, let him be careful of Miss "Justice", not to lose his identity on the spot... "The Fool" is watching the hidden truth behind the assassination, watching the person The real murderer? Who is it, or which organization, so that Mr. "fool" is so important? Alger instantly thought of a lot of things and made a preliminary judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down at the telegram and found that the church had set up a special investigation team for the assassination of the Duke of Nigan, each of whom was a punitive Elite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I want to apply to join and keep up to date? Alger was hesitant for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he decided to follow the original plan and develop at a low level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new day, Klein sleeps naturally, wakes up slowly, Wash down the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not in a hurry to prepare breakfast, but habitually opened the door, bathed in the mist, and took out today's newspaper from the letter box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Suddenly, he found a thick envelope in the newspaper, not too light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinch the surface, Klein’s mind flashed the ink of the banknote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spiritual instinct tells him that it is a lot of cash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully opened and pulled out the stack of gold pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the number of points, he confirmed that there were a total of 1,000 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the bounty given by the 'Heart of Hearts'... This is what they call secretly giving? How are they so relieved? Just put it in the letter box What if I was stolen?” Klein, who was delighted, couldn’t help but blame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this money, who is no longer secretly protected by the "Mechanical Heart", he can go to the vampire Emlin White. Pen trading! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast, Klein immediately put on his coat, put on his hat, picked up his cane, and clipped a newspaper out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he went to the public carriage site, he saw the host, Mrs. Stalin. Summer, instructing the maid to load the suitcase into the carriage in front of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Mrs. Summer." Klein smiled and said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stalin held a smile and returned to her greetings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mental state seems to have recovered... I don’t know what happened before... Klein asked curiosity:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the New Year, Mary gave Luke a holiday in advance, and we are going to Dixi Bay to welcome the new year. "Starlin volunteered. "Hey, we have been to several cities there. The famous coastal towns are also the same. We are preparing to go to Fenetport this time. The scenery of Seville is said to be very Not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein responded with great complicity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really enviable. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about you? Detective Moriarty, where are you going to spend the New Year?" Starling asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a high probability of staying in the local... Yes, I have to prepare tools to repair the walls that were punched out by Stuart before... Klein’s mouth is upturned :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back to the sea, there is a different taste in winter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sta Lin’s smile became more and more obvious:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I hope that the new year will meet you in Desi Bay.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South Bridge, Rose Garden, Harvest Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Sherlock in the black coat, Moriarty Detective came in, and Emlin White, who was carefully wiping the candlestick, smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took care of his hair and walked over and lowered his voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sen Beria's intelligence, a blood family knows him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also have his intelligence." Klein smiled and handed the newspaper to the past. The headline of the front page is: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yesterday, the distinguished Duke of Nigan was assassinated, the real demon plundered the earth."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under the heading is a detailed description of yesterday’s assassination, pointing out that the murderer was a banker named Patrick Jason and was killed on the spot, and the terrorist organization Aurora would claim responsibility for the incident. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw these news, Klein was squirting milk at breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He initially thought that Mr. A’s head of the Aurora meeting was broken, and this kind of thing had to be borne, but thought carefully and thought it was closer to the official one. cover up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the "Twilight Hermitage" is really the ancient organization that Russell the Great joined, they should be very hostile to the Aurora, after all, they hate the "real Creator"... Klein suddenly flashed such an idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin’s expression repeatedly looked at the newspaper and couldn’t believe it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, the information I got was useless?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a theoretical way." Klein glanced at Mr. Vampire with sympathy. "However, The official organization is still investigating the ambassador behind Jason Beria. If your intelligence points to this aspect, you should still be able to sell it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for gram Ryan himself, of course, does not want to mix this thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No... He just knows Jason Beria and knows some of his hobbies." Emlin sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his reaction, Klein laughed and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't usually watch Is the newspaper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big thing is known until now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emlin gave him a strange look:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why read the newspaper?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very busy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be busy cleaning in the Harvest Church, busy going home to accompany those dolls, busy trying to lie to blood...you are really a vampire in the new era... ... Klein opened his mouth and forced the laughter to be released with the power of the "clown".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
