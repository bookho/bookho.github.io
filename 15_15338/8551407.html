			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a deep red dissipated, and Dairik Berg once saw his bedroom again and saw the pure crystal ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal ball is broken from the inside out, or turned into a piece of illusory light flying into the surrounding void, or smashing into the ground, a little bit is Crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyrick looked at the scene silently, and found the bloody marks on his face from the reflection of the bronze mirror next to him, and found that the back of the right palm had The crimson light swirls inside and condenses a circle that radiates the roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strange symbol sneaked into the back of his hand and disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick licked a dozen times of lightning to illuminate the sky, finally waking up from the dream of general confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the crystal ball fragments on the ground, and licked his right hand back, his eyes gradually deepened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the bedroom, back to the living room, Dairik opened the door and looked up at the sky above the Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lightning flashed through, everything was covered with silver, and then, in the thunder of the rolling, the world was dark, there was no darkness of light, deep and dignified To the darkness of despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick’s hands clenched into fists, and there was no joy in his eyes, still sorrow and pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is no longer ignorant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, and flickered to a member, no, developed another Member... Klein smiled and shook his head, ridiculing the current strength of Tarot: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "fool" as the leader, only the sequence 9, just digested" Divination" potion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "Sun" can't see a little hope in the city of silver at least three high-order powerhouses with a sequence of four! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After re-pasting, you can explain the situation to the captain and make a special application. Once you become a 'clown,' I am at least no longer just an assistant." Klein did not. Stay, extend out of spirituality, wrap yourself, and fall down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peeing the fog, passing the slang, he returned to the room and lifted the wall of spirituality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Klein picked up the key and pulled out the door. He went to the two rooms that Dunn ordered and looked at it, confirming that the captain and Frye had not returned. Then went to the first floor and pushed the key to the boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss glanced at the wall clock on the side and raised his thumb:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s good!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, what do you think I am doing with a “hourly room”? Klein wanted to explain his mouth, but he finally decided to let the other party continue to misunderstand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels aggrieved and comforts himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, so he won’t have long tongue In front of the captain, I mentioned that I opened another room! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After going out for a pretentious gesture, Klein made a quick divination, returned to the hotel according to the results, went straight to the second floor, unexpectedly I saw Dunn and Frye communicating in the same room about the investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It can be confirmed that the grievances have only appeared in the last two or three months." Dunn glanced at Klein, who came in and opened the door, nodding his head and giving a conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately echoed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My investigation confirmed this..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You won't spend money to buy it?" Dunn's ashes flashed, stunned and asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, do you think I am so foolish that I am easily deceived? Klein laughed and laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, not, although I am only a student of the history department, I have also heard some classes in the Department of Archaeology, and I have certain in this area. The experience can initially identify the true and false, oh, the person on the oil painting is very similar to my history teacher, Mr. Azick."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used casually The unintentional attitude tells the most crucial thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun really did not pay attention to this, and slammed the corner of Emei: "This small town with ancient ruins is always full of all kinds of antiques. I just met the townspeople who sold the bart of Ramd Baron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Someone sold me the badge of the Ramde family, saying that it was from Excavated from the old castle." Frye echoed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein subconsciously asked: "You didn't buy it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frye With him, he looked at Frye and the two sides never continued this topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next task is that you or Frye who has recovered, take the seal '3—0782' to the place outside the town, otherwise Most of the people in the hotel have to become idiots who only know 'praise the sun'. You, first, Frye?" Dunn looked at Klein Road with a sullen look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I." Klein raised his hand a little and smiled. "It's not too late. I can come back to sleep well. It's a two-hour rotation." "Once?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Frye, you and Klein passed together and confirmed the place of the handover." Dunn looked sideways at the "collector" Frye - halfway through the investigation, he has already found an opportunity to hand over the seal "3 - 0782" to Frye, otherwise he will have been purified and he began to praise the sun, and Frye is not enough time to recover. Can only support for another three hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Frye took the "variation of the Sun's Emblem" from the inside of the black thin trench coat and reached for Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was very curious and took it with great interest. He only felt that the metal of the badge was warm and the inside was like hot water flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm and radiant light is like a cockroach, spreading out layer by layer, bringing a pure taste, at the same time, Klein only feels this sun The dark golden emblem of the symbol is constantly eroding its own spirituality, removing impurities and leaving pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the seal has a very pit side, it will be dead if you don’t pay attention, or it’s more tragic than dead... He secretly swears, seals "3—0782" was worn on the inside of the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming the state of the revolver, spell and cane, he accompanied Frye, walked out of the room, left the hotel, and headed straight outside the town of Ramd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the sparse and deserted woods, the two circled around and confirmed that there were no living people within a few tens of meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If anyone is close, drive him away." Frye said coldly and gloomyly, "I will take over two hours later." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Klein smiled and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Frye walking into the town, he found the half-high stone that had just been smashed, took off the leaves next to it, and wiped the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he touched the top of the stone with his finger and observed the fingertips with the blushing moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirmed correctly, Klein picked up the black thin windbreaker and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not stand while sitting! He added silently in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes calm, he looked at the dark, quiet and terrible grove, couldn’t help but stand up and squat in the pockets inside the clothes. Out of a different metal vial, a circle of herbal powder and essential oils were sprayed around the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two purposes for this simple ritual. One is not relying on the fortune teller's hunch for danger, guarding against dead bodies and ghosts attacking himself, and second, and second, dispelling mosquitoes...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a hundred times better than the toilet water! Klein sat down satisfactorily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having been sitting bored for a few minutes, he was very curious to remove the seal "3-0782" and carefully examined the "variation of the sun's emblem" ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if I can divinate its origins and special sources... Suddenly, Klein flashed an interesting idea, so he took out the paper he carried with him. And the pen with water, write the divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The source of the variation of the sun's emblem in my hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; - As a qualified and true diviner, Klein has long been prepared for divination anytime, anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meditation on the divination statement seven times, he closed his eyes and entered the state of meditation, as a springboard, began his own dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream, he only saw a pure light, and there was no other gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the church must have tried to find another diviner before, and there is no source in the information, which means that no effective results have been obtained, just like I did just now... ..." Klein sighed and thought, "I don't know what to do if I eliminate the interference?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea has just emerged, immediately Occupy his brain, let his curiosity reach its zenith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hesitating for ten minutes, he saw the night quiet, no one left, and he was in the hidden place of the grove, not to be seen by passers-by. Then he stood up and took four steps in the wall of spirituality and re-entered the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the majestic palace, Klein sat at the top of the old long table, with a yellow-brown parchment, a black round belly pen and That "variation of the sun's holy emblem." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It feels very real..." He picked up the seal "3—0782" and smashed it, only to feel the same shape and touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rely on my feelings? Klein replied, rewriting the previous divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The source of the mutated sun emblem in my hands."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seven times of silent reading, he took the parchment and seal "3 - 0782" and leaned back into the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray world of illusion, Klein saw a drop of golden, warm, bright liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It floats above the altar and stands in front of a man wearing a white classical robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man only has a back and loses all his life. He slowly falls down and falls to the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sun's emblem that he held touched the golden liquid, which quickly penetrated into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw this, the dreams faded and woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out that because of the golden liquid that was blended, this holy emblem can always be effective and cannot be controlled. Well, at least it was discovered until now. For decades, the ability to purify has not declined... I don’t know what the golden liquid is.... Some kind of high-grade extraordinary material?” Klein plunged into the present seal “3—0782”. Deep meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering for a few minutes, he tried to reverse the "Golden Liquid" in the opposite direction based on the feelings of his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking is already present, Klein stunned and stared blankly at the badge that was no longer so warm and pure, watching the drop of quiet floating golden liquid , a higher evaluation of the mysterious space above the fog:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
