I have to go back to the hidden organization behind the request... Is this a problem that I can't do? This is a problem with no money! Klein spoke himself, closing up the "Grossel Travels", asking: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know who the author is?<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was the last person who once owned this book? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina walked over to him, extended his right hand, and rubbed his fingers with his fingers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The former owner could not be verified because of the fog of history, the sinking of the ship and the lack of corresponding information. It is also impossible to confirm who the author is. The amount is not signed on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have done some research with mystery and found that parchment was made at least 3,000 years ago before the Cataclysm.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is why I think it is worth at least £8,000. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three thousand years ago, the characters contained in the characters except the dragons, the elves, and the human monks, the Solomon Empire, and the Lun soldiers... The concept of the age! A magical book with hidden prophecy? Or who deliberately made it with ancient parchment? But what is the point, pure prank? Klein deliberately whispers but does not smile. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The name of the giant is Grosser, will the author be Russell?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. The name Russell itself stems from the dismantling of the giant language. It changed for the second time in the ancient Fussac language when it came out of Intis. It has different meanings..." Edwina explained Luo in detail. The origin of the name of Searle came from the sound of Klein, and there was a feeling of returning to school.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently daggers and turns Nothing whispered and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is an ancient work, I am curious why a frosty dragon can be called the 'King of the North', it will What sequence does it correspond to? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina lifted her gaze from "Grossel Travels" and looked at Klein Road:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before the first slate appeared, there was no concept of pathways and sequences, and many creatures would not follow this arrangement. The era, chaos and madness are the main tone of everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some dragons may come together with many extraordinary features related to frost, like the Frost of the Witch, the Frost of the 'Live Corpse', 'Weather Warlock' The frost, in this way, it has extremely strong strength and a fairly high personality, of course, similar gathering will inevitably lead to death and loss of control.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This sentence means that if it is not dead, it will inevitably become a monster, but the dragon itself is a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are many similar products in the dragon, the giant, and the elf, then the second era is called the "Dark Age" and you can understand... Klein sinks At a glance, it seems like talking to yourself and saying: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This creates a waste of extraordinary features."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina looked at him for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Russell the Great once said a word:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where the separation must be aggregated, where the polymerization will be separated. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great said? The first sentence I understand is another expression of the extraordinary characteristic aggregation law. What does the second meaning mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Achieve a certain degree, there will be separation and rejection trends? When they do not belong to a single path, they will be separated in a very chaotic manner, will there be a separation effect? The more chaotic, the more repulsive each other?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this case, the emperor should not casually say to people, certainly not in the kind of quotations that are circulating outside... I Last time I guessed from the Russell Dream and the name of the Lieutenant General, she was the descendant of Edwards, one of the four Knights of the Apocalypse....maybe great...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"The great emperor fell behind, their family fled to Rumburg, and gradually converted to the 'God of knowledge and wisdom'?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a good teacher, just ask Must answer! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein will no longer say more and appreciate the other collection of "Iceberg Lieutenant".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At the same time, he had a certain idea in his heart, that is, when the Tarot party, asked the "Sun" through the "world" to see if he knew the book "Grossel Travels".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in order not to let the "downside down" taste the "world" from the problem, and thus detect the "fool" anomaly, he decided to communicate alone, shielding others <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly visiting, Edwina led Klein out of the collection room and entered the room belonging to the captain in the pirate restaurant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The special food here is yogurt, you can add jams such as strawberries, or you can put honey directly..." Edwina pointed to the food lane outside the door. "There are several The dried fish is also good, it is a species from the deep sea that has not yet been named. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the conversation, she signaled that Klein had taken it herself, took it back to the room, and got up and set an example.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the yoghurt who didn't know who made it, put a few spoonfuls of honey inside, and then carried the plate, and picked up the pork sausage, cream bagels and other foods inside.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, he saw a black vest with a white shirt and a bow tie. The young man like a victor than a pirate approached the "Iceberg Lieutenant" Edwina, whispering What is it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man looks good, his hair is golden, his hair is darker, and he leans neatly to the sides.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His twilight is very shallow, the lake is green, the nose is very thin, the lips are thin, and there is a kind of trustworthy temperament.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be fooled by this guy's appearance, he is a canned fish, it is full of stench! "Daniz didn't know when he also entered the pirate restaurant, came to Klein's side and whispered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein squinted at him, what? Didn’t say anything, because he knew that Daniz would explain it on his own initiative.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t wait for Daniz’s opening, the man with a bloated waist next to him The sharp voice said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is the third officer, Jodson, who used to be a playboy and pirate, said to steal our captain’s heart, and the result was Have a meal, stay and receive education, shit! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In short, he is not a good thing! "Daniz emphasizes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a good thing! "Another pirate with a black complexion echoes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you always feel that you are very consistent... Klein thought for a moment:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""The 5,200-pound 'flower bow tie' Jodson? Sequence 6? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a standard Galman Spalo reaction...Daniels looked over the side and said with a bit of disdain:< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is not too strong, it is very strange, I fight with him, no, when fighting, suddenly can not use the fireball, and he can imitate me Flame ability. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very familiar description... Klein subconsciously looked over to Jederson and thought about it carefully, remembering where he heard:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very similar to a seal "Vascular Thief" behind the Chanis Gate in Tingen City!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Klein could not remember the seal number of the "vascular thief", but also clearly remembered that it could temporarily steal someone's extraordinary ability for their own use.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correspondence By the way, Klein retracted his gaze and found that Daniz and his two companions looked at the side while drinking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanted to reach Niz With his own sacrifice to Caviteu, Klein took a beer and took the plate and walked to the captain's dining room, casually saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
