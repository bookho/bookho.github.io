			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz’s worries did not materialize. Klein just glanced at him and went into the bedroom to prepare for a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the five hours of the passenger liner, his spirit was always in a state of high tension. He was disturbed last night and did not sleep well. It was inevitable that he was exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blinking, Klein closed the door to the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call... scared me! Daniz relaxed as a whole and sat down in the easy chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, his mind has emerged as a scene of becoming a golden pound, and one scene after another, it is difficult to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Daniz, who was fooling around at the bar until he returned to the hotel, unknowingly slept and dreamed that the captain was coming to save himself. Succeeded by the victory of German Sparrow, this crazy adventurer has more maids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Deniz’s anger, but dare not resist, when he woke up, he suddenly saw the blurred scenes become clear and fixed in the blue The style of the hotel is in the luxury suite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚,咚,咚. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz heard a slow and knocking door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not dreaming? With such doubts, Daniz walked to the door and twisted his handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is getting bigger and bigger, he saw a familiar figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a beautiful lady with a face like a goose egg, a high nose and a thin lips with a pair of light blue eyes that look like clear spring water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her brown long hair separates from the middle, and makes a simple but delicate knot behind her head, then goes down smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t wear a hat, she wore a beige coat with a tight waist, and a large white lace-woven slap-sized flower-shaped ornament spread down the neckline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dark knee-length skirt with a jacket, the skirt is pleated and connected, slightly fluffy, and the feet are double leather boots with similar hair color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain!" Daniz exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately woke up and quickly turned his body and made a defensive posture against the bedroom of the German Sparrow:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful! Run! There is a madman who wants to find you! There is a terrible organization behind him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacrifice At the same time, Daniz heard his captain calmly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Dream...Yes, I am dreaming, what is so scary... Daniz looked around, folded his arms, and turned around and backed off:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, did you simulate the ability of 'nightmare'? No, you were still near the island of Sunia last week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su The island of Nia is the largest island in the sea and the source of the name of the Sunia Sea. It is almost equal to a small continent. It was originally the only settlement of the elves after the Cataclysm, but over time, this ancient extraordinary Race is varied The factors are plagued by gradual demise, leaving only occasional, sporadic appearances that prove they have not been completely extinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the Quaternary, the Kingdom of Luen occupied the island, but in the "Twenty Years War", they suffered defeat and shook the island of Sunia It was given to the Fossac Empire for more than seven hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonia Island is located north-northwest of the Rothschild Islands. It takes nearly half a month to get on the boat. Last week, it was still near the iceberg of Sunia Island. Lieutenant General, Edwina Edwards could not arrive in Bayam this week, unless she would fly or use the spirit world to shuttle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful lady who was called the captain by Daniz nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We just entered Rothschild, 1000 nautical miles from Baiam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, there are still three or four days to arrive? This is normal... Daniz is curious: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This should have exceeded the scope of 'nightmare'?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is far more than... He added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina enters the room and walks to the table and chair position:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s not a 'nightmare', it’s a secret ritual magic that, with some of the items you leave on the ship, enters your dreams far away...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Listening to the captain's meticulous explanation, Daniz instantly had the feeling of returning to the "Golden Dream" and starting classes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never heard of this ritual magic... Also, the captain has mastered many strange and rare magic and witchcraft, no one can figure out her. How much knowledge she has... She seems to mention that her serial title is "mystery tutor"... Hey, if I knew that she had this "secret" before, I wouldn’t bother with how to make Bayam’s The news has informed her of the problem... Daniz has a lot of thoughts and interrupted Edwina’s description:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, you are aware of the contact point here. "Is there a problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, this is another mystery..." Edwina seems to have a tendency to describe the specific method in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz saw it and sighed with a sigh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor old Lynn them... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aide Wenna stopped and walked back to the window, asking for simplicity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This needs to start from the port of Damir." Daniz’s spirit is so strong that only a long-lasting repression is finally here. I got a return in a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slyly described his attempt to recruit Galman Sparo, but found that the other party was a madman, and exaggerated the "White Onyx" The tragic experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed the draft of last night, the original local local ambition and horror of Banxi, the "ambulance" of the "Iron" McVetti, and the joint killing Man Sparrow's counter-attacks and hunting, all of which were repeated, and carefully explained his own speculations about the ability and background of German Sparrow, including "squirming hunger" and a secretive and powerful organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, he tries to restore the truth as much as possible, but only slightly exaggerates the role he plays, and raises his status from servants and attendants to the level of assistants and collaborators. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Iceberger Lieutenant" Edwina has been listening quietly, without interrupting his words, and finally slammed the first:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is not malicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He? Is Greman Spalo not malicious? Daniz quickly said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, no matter what, he is a dangerous guy!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Are you sure he is not malicious? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not sure. Edwina responded very calmly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What did you just do? "Daniz took a breath and said that the captain is similar to that of German Sparrow. It is a type that can't talk well.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "A Devina's expression is not unusual." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is my speculation and judgment." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Daniz licked his forehead with his right hand. "In short, he is very dangerous. There is a hidden, uninformed organization behind him." Captain, I think you shouldn't risk talking to him, even if he claims to have something to ask. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edwina thought about the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to take risks." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can communicate with you through you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz first breathed a sigh of relief, then asked curiously and expectantly:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, what do you do? Or, how do I cooperate with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aide Wenna raises her right hand in her dreams There is a stand and a blackboard:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You need to hold a ceremony.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Calling 'Golden Ceremony', let my spirit pass through the spiritual world, attach to your body, and talk directly to German Sparrow. Under the demigod, the effective distance is no more than 500 nautical miles...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It involves reason and communication, the domain of the god of knowledge and wisdom, you must depict the corresponding symbol and magic logo...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In occultism, the god of knowledge and wisdom is the Blue Star, which needs to use mercury, brass, lavender, pepper, and mint as materials...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Blue Star corresponds to Saturday, Blue Star has Friday's zero to 1 o'clock, Saturday's noon 11 to 12 o'clock..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aidewen Naan explained that while writing on the blackboard, the key points to be remembered, Daniz instinct sat down and put on a gesture of listening to the class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing, he suddenly has some sorrow:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I have to dream to learn? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bedroom, Klein, who was sleeping, suddenly woke up and vaguely noticed What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned up and listened to his ears, and found that Daniz in the living room was snoring, but it was much smoother than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a very strange performance, but it is unusual enough for Clarion, a mysterious veteran who has experienced many things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a light step and walked to the door separating the bedroom and living room, snatched the handle and slowly twisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, Klein stepped out of the bedroom and saw Daniz lying in the easy chair, sleeping well, and everything around him was as normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein quietly opened the vision and checked the "flame", but did not find any problems, no matter the color of the gas field or the emotional changes, the other party was normal. Within a reasonable range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overlooking for a while, Klein frowned slightly and reached out with a silver spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dream Charm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream, Daniz learned the "death ritual" in the face of bitterness, and he did not doubt that the captain in front of him was disguised by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The styling of such a style is such a speciality, no one can pretend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he heard the sound of the lock cylinder turning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, Daniz looked back at the bedroom and saw that the door was getting bigger and bigger, and the upper body only wore a white shirt. Sparo came out blankly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You! How come out!" Daniz stood up and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly returned, stuttering and saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This, this is My dream!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German.Sparo This guy appears when it appears! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean single-handedly inserted in the trouser pocket of dark trousers and walked towards the lady who was facing the window, replied with a low voice:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A spell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
