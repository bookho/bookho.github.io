			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaked internal organs, yellow-green liquid, quietly burning black flame, the human body dumped forward, while reflecting Klein’s eyes, deeply imprinted In his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most dangerous situation he has experienced so far is to deal with Riel Bieber who was interrupted by the digestive process, even if it is so dangerous The horrible monsters only caused serious injuries to the participants and did not let anyone sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only teammate lost by Kline, Neil, and the official extraordinary deaths he witnessed, stemmed from loss of control, "murderers" or secrets. Or pointing to evil spirits, not related to specific tasks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, for the first time in his mission, he saw the sacrifice of his teammates. This death is only due to a wrong choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nights are fighting against madness, and they are also fighting the danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making a mistake, there may be no chance to make up for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang, Klein’s thoughts exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have been greatly stimulated, half squatting on the ground, raising his right hand, and he shot at Mrs. Shelen, letting a silver The hunter bullets pass through countless invisible filaments and shoot at each other's head, aiming at each other's translucent nightdress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, Mrs. Shelen was as fast as something pulled and pulled in the other direction, avoiding Kline’s crazy shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the five bullets in the revolver were all shot out, until the sound of an empty gun sounded in the ear, Klein woke up and recovered his ability to think. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a tight heart, no time to replace the bullets, directly throwing away the pistol, and grabbed a stack of tarot cards! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Shelen’s body slammed and saw a card flying over and deeply inserted into the surface of the dressing table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She outlined the corners of her mouth, and the beautiful brown cockroaches once again dyed the dark color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, her waterfall-like brown hair suddenly rose, as if it had been blown by invisible power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Shelen’s stunned, and then evaded, it’s a slow half-shoot, and the “Magician” card thrown by Klein’s wrist will be a haircut. Nailed on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Mrs. Shelen forcibly broke her hair and rolled forward, and her body quickly disappeared into Klein’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s invisible... Kline’s fingers are holding the tarot cards, moving slowly and guarding the perimeter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he understood why Mrs. Shelen had just given up the attack and why it was slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——According to normal development, Klein does not use the "Azick Copper Whistle" to fight against this terrible witch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! It must be that the captain rushed to the vicinity! He was happy in his heart, his eyes turned, and he looked down to the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he came up with a judgment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Shelen wants to escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just knew that we have a companion who can drag her into the dream companion, but she doesn’t know if there are any other nights, punitives. , or a member of the heart of the machine! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is powerful, but she is not the only one who can destroy a team of extraordinary people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart flashed, Klein shook his wrist, threw the tarot card and threw it in the direction of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗖嗖嗖! He threw five cards in a row, three blocked the windows, and two turned into flying knives, slamming toward the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! Snapped! Snapped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the broken glass sounds, the two tarot cards were deeply inserted into the semi-open bedroom door, and Klein heard the dodge sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again shakes the wrist card and, with the instinct of the "clown", throws a card at a position on the side of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The card with a sharp break, quickly approached there, but hard to get into the hard wall, but a figure quickly outlined in the air, It is Mrs. Shelen, who wears translucent nightgown and brown hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mrs. Shelen was exposed, her eyes lost and she seemed to stand and enter sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain... Klein’s eyes swept away, not eager to throw out cards, because he knew that Mrs. Shelen would soon be able to break free of dreams, if not in two or three seconds The inside of the clock caused fatal damage to her, and the other party would forcibly escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightmare at such a distance is easy to break free! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knee bent, Klein slammed to the side forward, half squatting on the ground, stretching his right hand, grabbing the face-up "Psychic Mirror "the edge of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he shook his wrist and smashed the seal "3 - 0271" before he was mirrored, facing the grounds of Mrs. Go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Xue Lun’s body shook a bit, and the look inside the palm stalk quickly returned to normal, and the gaze also found the focal length. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And earlier than she was awake, her body surface showed a layer of crystal and solid frost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, she did not see the flying cards, or the silver hunting demon bullets, she only saw a mirror from far and near, only to see the mirror Reflecting his own pure and charming appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful face suddenly became distorted, wrinkles appeared on it, blood stains appeared, and rotten plaque appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!" Mrs. Shelen made a screaming scream, just like witnessing the death of a lover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her skin is quickly dyed green, with yellow pus out of her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After it, Mrs. Schellen burned a quiet black flame from the inside out, as if to drive out something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, the black flame has a thick frost outside, like a coffin that is making a sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible filaments entangled, finally superimposed with the visible color of the naked eye, they wrapped the frost layer by layer, it seems to bear A huge cocoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚,咚,咚, the seal "3—0271" landed, rolled forward a few laps, stopped next to Mrs. Shelen’s huge “cocoon” . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sound of jingle sounded, and Dunn broke through the window frame and turned into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at Cohenli, who lost his breath, and his expression was heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the "coconut" collapsed, the ice smashed, and the black flame turned into a fluorescent light, scattered around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Snow's skin color returned to normal, her eyes were slightly tired, but no abnormalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of her nephew shows Klein, who is still half-squatting, reflecting Dunn Smith, who reaches out and holds his eyebrows and closes his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a circle of invisible ripples, Mrs. Shelen’s eyelids couldn’t stop falling, and Dunn’s black thin windbreaker had a snake-like Something is creeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understand that the captain couldn’t control Mrs. Shelen for too long, just like the time to deal with the monster Bieber, Klein was another roll, grabbed the thrown on the carpet. The revolver that belongs to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed three silver hunting devil bullets in his left hand and stuffed it into the bullet hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein closed the runner and stood up, aiming at Mrs. Shelen with both hands and aiming at her eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He controlled the body with the power of the "clown" and pulled the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver hunting demon bullet flashed and hit the "fixed target" accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Xue Lun’s eyebrows showed a blood mark, but the bullets seemed to pass through many layers of invisible obstacles, losing most of their power and failing to open the other side. The skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not hesitate to open two more shots and saw Mrs. Snown’s eyes suddenly open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bloody rain accompanied by white spots spread out, and Mrs. Shelen, who is a stunner, became a broken skull female body that allowed every man to have a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her "replacement" has been used up before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, call, Klein's hands are drooping, the left wheel is slanting, and the gasping is rough, and Mrs. Shelen, who has only half of her head, is softly inverted. On the ground, the figure is still outstanding, and the skin is fair and tender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den straightened his body and opened his eyes. He put his hand on his eyebrows and his face was pale. He was obviously not injured, but he seemed to have lost too much blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If she didn't want to kill one or two people and flee, if it wasn't for the seal '3 - 0271' to reflect her, just show her look, we Maybe only hurt her..." Dunn stepped forward and walked over to Klein, his voice was unusually low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not for me to have a special place, the battle just started for a dozen seconds, and Cohenli and I also confessed... Klein looked sideways and quietly Cohenli, lying in the black ashes, spits a sigh of relief:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, Cohenli..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I know..." Dunn replied in a dumb voice. "I made a mistake and was blinded by Mrs. Shelen. I didn't expect her to have quietly left the dream."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused for a while, and said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, you must get used to it, it’s normal for the night to die in the mission. The next thing is me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was silent and didn’t know what to answer. Cohenli’s eyes were wide open and he was looking at the ceiling empty. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the goddess bless you and let you get a good sleep." Dunn came to Cohen Li and drew a red moon on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he squatted and closed the players’ eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May the goddess protect you, no more danger and madness in the quiet night... Klein also painted a red moon, silently praying in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, he forcibly regained his gaze and asked: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, now Is it psychic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng Enwei is not visible. First:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't try to ask' The original witch's related things, this is very dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will stay by the side, not letting the accident disturb you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't delay, took out all kinds of materials, quickly arranged the altar and began to psychic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the mantra, he took a step back and used the technique of "dream divination":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Mr. Xuelun's associates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Xue Lun's associates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven or more times, Klein entered the dream and saw the spirit of Mrs. Xuelun in the gray world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched this transparent, illusory spirit, and the change in front of him was changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
