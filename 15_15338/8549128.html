			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hurts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head hurts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whimsical dreams are quickly fragmented, and Zhou Mingrui, who is asleep, only feels that his head is sore, as if he had been stunned with a stick, no. It's more like being pierced into the temple with a sharp object and accompanied by agitation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶...In a confused way, Zhou Mingrui wants to turn over, wants to hoe, wants to sit up, can’t move his hands and feet at all, the body seems to have lost control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I haven’t really woken up yet, still in my dreams... I’m going to have to think that I’m already awake, actually still sleeping... ... Zhou Mingrui, who is not unfamiliar with similar encounters, is trying to concentrate on the will to completely get rid of the darkness and psychedelic embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when half-sleeping and half-awake, the will always drifts like smoke, difficult to control, difficult to close, how hard he tries, still can not help but divergence Miscellaneous thoughts emerge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good end, in the middle of the night, how can I suddenly have a headache? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hurts so much! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn’t it a brain hemorrhage? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wipe, I won’t die like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurry up! Hurry up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, it seems that it hasn’t hurt so much? But in my mind, I still have the blunt knife cut slowly...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I can’t continue to sleep, how can I go to work tomorrow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you want to go to work? There is a real headache, of course, is a vacation! Don't be afraid of manager Rory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking like this, it doesn’t seem to be bad, hey, stealing a half-day leisure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a burst of pain, Zhou Mingrui accumulates the power of illusion. Finally, he slams his back and opens his eyes, completely getting rid of half-sleep Half awake state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of sight was first blurred, and then a faint blush, and the eyes were clear. Zhou Mingrui saw a desk in front of the log color, and a book in the center. The notes that were spread out were rough and yellow, and the words were written in strange letters and words, and the ink was dark and eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left side of the notebook is on the edge of the table. There is a neat stack of books, about seven or eight. The walls on the right hand side are inlaid with gray pipes and Wall lamp that is connected to the pipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lamp has a western classical flavor, about half the size of an adult's head, the inner layer is transparent glass, and the outside is surrounded by a ferrous metal grid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the wall lamp is tilted downwards, a black ink bottle shrouds the light red brilliance, and the surface embossing forms a blurred angel pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the ink bottle, on the right side of the notebook, a dark pen with a round belly is quietly placed, the tip of the pen is shimmering, and the cap is placed on a pan Brass color next to the revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pistol? Revolver? Zhou Mingrui was stunned by the whole person. The things he saw in front of him were so strange that they didn’t look like their room! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he found that desks, notebooks, ink bottles, and revolvers were covered with a blushing "gauze", which was taken out of the window. Brilliant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, he raised his head and moved his sight a little upward:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the air, Above the black "velvet curtain", a red-red full moon hangs high and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... Zhou Mingrui is inexplicably, standing up, but his legs are not completely straight, and his head is aching, which makes him lose for a short time. Strength, the center of gravity fell involuntarily, and the buttocks slammed into the chair made of hardwood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain did not affect it. Zhou Mingrui pressed his hand to the table and stood up again. He turned his head in a panic and looked at his environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small room with a brown door on each side of the left and right, and a wooden bed next to the opposite wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a cabinet between the left door, which is open above and five drawers below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The edge of the cabinet, one person high position, also has a gray-white pipe inlaid on the wall, but it is connected with a strange mechanical device, a few places bare gears and bearings . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right corner of the desk is filled with things like coal stoves, as well as kitchen utensils such as soup pots and iron pots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the right door is a dressing mirror with two cracks, the wooden base has a simple and plain pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes swept away, Zhou Mingrui vaguely saw himself in the mirror, now himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Black hair, brown 瞳, linen shirt, thin body, common facial features, deep outline...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... Zhou Mingrui took a breath of cold breath There are a lot of helpless and messy speculations in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revolver, European and American classical style layout, and the moon that is different from the earth, all of which illustrate an event! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, I won’t go through it? Zhou Mingrui's mouth opened a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks at the web and grows up, often has illusions about it, but when it comes to real encounter, it is difficult to accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the so-called Ye Gong Hao Long? After a few tens of seconds, Zhou Mingrui made a self-satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the pain in the head is still there, and the mind becomes tight and clear, he will doubt that he is dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm, calm, calm... Take a few deep breaths, and Zhou Mingrui tries to keep himself from being so confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, with his physical and mental reconciliation, each piece of memory suddenly jumped out and slowly appeared in his mind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein Moretti, a native of the University of Thuringia in the Aowa County of the Northern Territory of the Ruin Kingdom, a fresh graduate of the Department of History at Hoy... /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father is a sergeant of the Royal Army, sacrificed in the colonial conflict in the South, and the exchange of benefits gave Klein an opportunity to enter a private grammar school and laid him The basis for admission to the university...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother is a goddess of the night goddess, passed away when Klein passed the entrance exam for the Hoy University...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a brother, a sister who lives in the two-bedroom apartment of the apartment...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family is not rich, maybe even Poorly speaking, at present, relying on the elder brother of the import and export company as a clerk to maintain...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a history graduate, Klein has mastered the words of the Northland countries. The ancient Fossack language at the source, as well as the Hermes, which often appears in ancient tombs, related to sacrifices and prayers...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hermesian? Zhou Mingrui's heart moved, reaching out and holding the painful temple, and then turned his attention to the note on the desk. He only felt that the line on the yellow paper became strange from strange, familiar from strange, familiar. It becomes understandable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the words written in Hermes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark ink is like saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone will die, including me ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶! Zhou Mingrui was inexplicably frightened, and his body instinctively leaned back, trying to pull away from the notebook with this line of text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very weak, almost falls, hurriedly reaching down and holding the edge of the table, only the air around him becomes turbulent, and the ear faintly whispers echoing There is a feeling of listening to the elders telling horror stories when they are young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
