			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein couldn’t help himself to defeat Frank Lee, and he was too embarrassed to say that red wine fish can’t breed is a good thing, only pretend that this is only A trivial question, no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked two steps, winding to the edge of the ship's side, looking at the uneven sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the clouds at high altitudes have become thinner and thinner, and the glory of the moon has brightened the dark nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an environment, Klein saw the scene not far away, where the clouds were stacked and pressed down very low, and the hurricane that could exist was found to be back and forth. Grabbing, shrouded in the vast seas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the shining of silver and white lightning, the fine rainstorm danced with the wind, creating a scene of the end of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible disaster is probably a few nautical miles or even closer to the "future", but this side has hardly been affected, only the wind has become bigger. A little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the meaning of a safe waterway, moving forward at the interval of the storm...If there is no qualified voyage, it may just be normal driving, and it will be involved in disaster... ... Klein looked sideways at the front of the boat, only to see the light dim, the fog filled, the visibility was very low, it was difficult to distinguish between dangerous and non-hazardous areas by the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar situation is still not obvious in the west of Olawe Island. It is normal to get to the hidden channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is about to look back, suddenly seeing the edge of the storm seems to hide a dark behemoth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea monster? He was fascinated by the rumors heard at the bar:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the safe waterway, it is easy to meet a variety of monsters, some of which are bulky It is very aggressive and will swallow the boat once it has surfaced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Future" did not stop moving forward, and it took a long time to get closer to the dark and dark behemoth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein finally saw the other side's appearance and found that it was not a sea monster, but a sailboat that was bigger than the "future". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of the sailboat is close to two hundred meters, and it is tilted up and down, and the whole is like a round of meniscus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface is black painted; the side of the ship's artillery is divided into three rows, up and down order; the part of the protruding deck, in addition to the mast, is also tall and huge At least equivalent to a five-story house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most bizarre thing about this ship is that there is only one sail, which depicts a black tombstone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The death sign..." The dignified voice rang in Klein's ear, and Frank Lee didn't know when he had discarded the silver scales that used red wine as blood. The fish came to his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 7,000-pound grand prince was sullen and his muscles were tight, and he seemed to be attacking at any time due to minor changes in the huge sailboat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dead number? Klein first glimpsed and immediately remembered what the name represented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one of the most famous and legendary ships on the Five Seas! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the flagship of "The King of Undead" Agarito! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one of the "four kings"... Klein secretly snarled and was unable to contain it into a state of high alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he remained indifferent and calm on the surface, still looking at the "death". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the second son of "The King of Undead", the "slayer" of the £9,500 "German" recently appeared in Nass and warned himself Klein immediately relieved, no longer wondering why he would encounter a "death" in a place not far from the Gargas Islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After putting this problem down, he recalled more rumors, and some of these rumors can be determined to be true descriptions:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'The King of Undead' Agarito is a middle-aged man who is pale to seem to rot at any time;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His single country bounty is as high as 100,000 pounds; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people who have been enemies with him, whether pirates, adventurers, or a certain naval fleet, have died out, only the same as the 'four kings' The three are still alive; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has never been in direct conflict with the official demigod, and he is extremely restrained in this regard;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost no one knows his specific sequence, no one knows his extraordinary ability;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is cruel, hobby, killing, at any time Attacks on any vessel of any person;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He likes to make excuses to tear up the promise, in addition to the title of 'King of Undead,' is also widely called 'unbelievers '."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, I am now riding the "Future", "The King of Undead" should sell "Stars above" a few faces After all, Ms. "Hidden" is also one of the seven pirate generals. No, the "Four Kings" and the pirate generals, in addition to being in the pirate congress convened by the "King of the Five Seas", can live in peace. Under normal conditions, there is cooperation. There are also confrontations, and the latter are mostly. A few months ago, "the blood will be" and "the dusk lieutenant" will fight a battle... plus the "immortal king" style, things may not only stay in the road ! Klein had just flashed such thoughts and heard a low horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors who are resting in the cabin wake up instantly, don’t wear clothes, or go straight to different muzzles, or come to the deck to make the joint In preparation, the "Future" changed from a peaceful state to a wartime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein turned his head and looked up, only to see that the window of the captain's room had been opened, and "the star above" Jia Delia was dressed in a constant black robes. Standing there, staring at the direction of "death". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not wear that pair of heavy glasses, the dark eyes were stained with a little deep purple, secluded and mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, she also worried that the 'King of Undead' suddenly launched an attack..." Kline regained his gaze and looked back at the head-to-tail "death" number". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the two ships are in a state of passing by, and the pirates on the opposite side are faintly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guys are also looking at this side, or quiet like a statue, there seems to be no emotional fluctuations, or waving a knife, blowing a gun, the most provocative thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, as long as a match, you can ignite the tension and let the battle break out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the "death" did not have any action, and remained quiet in the same place, "eye" sent the "future" over himself and gradually went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call..." Frank Lee, next to Klein, gave a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He re-appears a smile, to Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, about the king of immortality 'The speculation of strength has been a lot of rumors. Some people say that he is indeed a demigod. Some people say that he only has sequence 5, and he has reached the level of sequence 4 with the help of the 'death', but he has already Live long enough, oh... you said, can he and my fish be crossed together to improve their life cycle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank suddenly has inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, you must be able to seize the "King of Undead," or let him be interested in your fish... Klein whispered a few words, calmly said :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can ask him to discuss this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank. Lee stunned , sighed in dismay: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He won't promise, he will plant me directly into the soil."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice just fell, and the "death" that has opened a distance from the "Future" suddenly turned the sail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sharp, full of malicious laughter came across hundreds of meters, covering the entire "future." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
