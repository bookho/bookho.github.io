			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Golden Retriever Susie, Audrey took a few steps back and forth, it seems that it is not enough, because she does not know whether today’s ritual magic will Something strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So..." Her eyes turned and she looked at the expected process with the attitude of a bystander, and soon there was a new arrangement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey locks the door of the bedroom to the Golden Retriever:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Su Hey, you are here, if Anne wants to force in, I will inform the bathroom immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent some accidents, her personal maid can be lifted. The key to unlocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Su Shi looked at her in a faint gaze and shook his tail three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, I will let you pick today's lunch!" Audrey clenched her fist and shook it gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she entered the bathroom and saw a square or three-meter square bathtub with long and clear water, white air, and misty smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey has cleaned up a rectangular table that was originally filled with bottles and cans, then returned to the outside, putting candles, offerings and whites The robes and other things moved in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, she closed the door of the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Audrey sighed and picked up a palm-sized light blue translucent bottle from the side of the four candles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bottle is cylindrical, with a dreamy glow under the light, inside is the ritual oil that she distilled and extracted yesterday - as a mysterious hobby She did not study similar things. She had many self-made pure dew, flower essence, balm, essential oil and incense, so she quickly prepared for the fool's description. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moon flower, golden mint, deep sleep flower, golden hand and rock rose... strange formula..." Audrey whispered, "Well. Before the ritual magic, we must clean the body and calm the soul. This is the respect for the gods, sorrows, and prayers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the process, she will ritual oil Put it on the edge of the bathtub and reach out to light up the light at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One piece of silk fabric falls in the changing basket, Audrey has long hair, try the water temperature first, then the toes are slightly squatting, carefully Into, sinking the body into the warm embrace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call..." She vomited comfortably, only to feel warm and relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a finger that doesn’t want to move... Audrey’s forcible spirit, grabbing the light blue translucent vial next to it, and sipping the essential oil A few drops into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of fragrance, the quiet fragrance is hidden, Audrey took a few mouthfuls, and sat down with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, very good smell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really relaxing, so comfortable... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to move at all, I really hope that I will lie quietly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Quiet quiet, quiet... quiet... quiet..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long ago, Audrey suddenly heard the barking dog call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened her eyes and looked around in confusion, and found that Su Shi did not know when she had opened the door and squatted outside the bathtub, her eyes were quite helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After licking the corner of the eye, Audrey feels that the water temperature has dropped a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, am I asleep?" she asked subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi looked at her, no barking, no wags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, the effect of the bottle of ritual oil is really good, um, it’s good!" Audrey laughed twice and explained in a cheerful tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up, took a bath towel, wrapped and wiped her body, and said to the Golden Retriever dog:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Su Shi, keep guarding, don't let Annie Come in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Golden Retriever left, she quietly spit out her tongue, dropped the bath towel, and put the clean white robes directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the bathroom door, Audrey seriously recalled the rituals he recorded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked up four candles and placed them in the four corners of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The top left white bread, the upper right side of the Fernport face, so sweet, it is a bit cold... No, it is not the time to think about these things! On the lower left paella, on the lower right, Desi pie..." Audrey carefully arranged the altar in accordance with the description of the fool, and shook his head twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be prepared, she ignited four candles in turn, picked up the silver knife and inserted it into the thick salt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After mourning the sacred curse of the Hermes, Audrey proposed the knife with a gorgeous pattern and placed it in a cup with clear water. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save the spirit, she pulled away from the silver "sacred blade", meditating on the spiritual spread, the scene from the tip of the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible power surged, Audrey took a knife and circled around the altar, only to see that the spiritual walls were erected around, and all Unclean, all interference is excluded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She maintains the status of the "audience" and does not let the excitement and excitement affect the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the silver knife, she picks up the light blue crystal vial and drops a drop to each candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint aroma is filled in abundance, and Audrey’s body, mind, and spirit seem to be quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She secretly took a breath, bowed her head reverently, and mourned the official mantra in Hermes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A fool who does not belong to this era;"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the mysterious ruler above the fog;"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the king of yellow and black for the good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for your help."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray for your care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pray that you will have a good dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deep sleep, the herbs that belong to the Red Moon, please pass the power to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Chandal, the herb that belongs to the sun, please pass the power to my mantra."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey just remembered the mantra and planned to meditate on the content of the prayer, and felt the wind in the sealed spiritual wall is scratching, just look Crimson stars that back in circulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She jumped in her heart, half closed her eyes, calmly sketched, and sincerely requested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was over, she looked around in confusion and found no other weird phenomena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is all right?" Audrey frowned and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king of yellow and black who is in good luck... does not belong to this The Fool of the Age..." Inside the captain of the "Blue Avenger", Alger Wilson, a storm robes, silently recited the three paragraphs he heard in the afternoon, seemingly trying to find clues about his identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and got up slightly irritated, but eventually did nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger is not at ease with regard to the ancient ship left by the "Blue Avenger", the Tudor dynasty, although he has mastered its control. Right, but there is always an intuition telling him that this ship still has a lot of secrets, just like the blood emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, he will use this ship to test the ability of the fool, but will not try unknown ritual magic on the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger pondered for a few minutes, left the captain's room, and came to the deck, to the crew of the crew:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are about to arrive in the Rothde Islands and will stay there for one day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crew cheered and shouted loudly:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for the bishop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the ghost ship does not need sailors, the crew is few, so they never Worried about replenishment, you can enjoy fresh food and water every day, but day after day sailing and almost no change of scenery, still make their bodies and minds feel tired, as if they are always suppressing, endure What, until I can't control it anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Rhodes Islands are famous colonies on the sea in Sonia, with developed businesses and various industries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just don't want to wait!" A "sailor" shrugged his waist and gave a laughter that men knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the public carriage on Zouteland Street, watching leisurely The newspaper's Klein suddenly caught, and seemed to hear an illusory shout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible whisper echoed in his mind, letting his forehead jump and jump, difficult to control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not clear that the call for content is coming fast, and it’s going fast, but it’s only a matter of ten seconds, Klein squeezes his forehead and fights against it. Pain from the depths of the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the inexplicable whisper of the old Neil? Why is the inspiration too high?" One thought flashed, and Klein suddenly saw the four black spots on the back of the right hand. I don't know when it is highlighted. They are like natural flaws, and they are very inconspicuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is due to the fact that the four black spots of the transshipment ceremony quickly precipitated and disappeared from deep to disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at it and made a guess about what happened just now:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' Justice 'or 'down' people tried the ritual magic I gave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My thoughts are right?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The three paragraphs can really point me precisely through the mysterious space above the fog?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I still Far from being strong enough, I can't understand the content of the prayer... I don't know if there is any message on the fog, 'Retained'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, enter tonight , confirm it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is a little embarrassed, and a little excited, busy erecting newspapers, covering his face, not letting others see their expression changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he arrived at Zouteland Street and entered the Blackthorn Security Company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the future, he greeted Rosanne, and Klein saw Captain Dunn Smith coming out with a paper with portraits in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also look at this internal warrant, a very vicious and cruel extraordinary person who entered Tingen." Wearing a black trench coat, no hat Dunn glanced over here and handed the piece of paper over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a look, the first thing that caught his eye was a sketch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the portrait has a round face, a temperamental affinity with a bit of awkwardness, not too much age, it is 18 or nine years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tris, suspected extraordinary, preliminary assessment for the sequence 8 'teachers', does not rule out the possibility of 'smart associations', the manufacture of the nickname tragedy There are witnesses who have proved that he left the port of Enmat and later went to Tingen. His whereabouts are unknown..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tris...nickname...even Is it an extraordinary person to commit crimes? Klein Horan remembered the dream of yesterday afternoon, remembered the description of Joyce Meyer, and immediately said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
