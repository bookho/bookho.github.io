			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the captain's interior, Jia Delia slowly climbed up from the floor and walked silently to the full-length mirror next to the bookcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skin on her face in the mirror is white and smooth, can not see a crack, the ears are normal and small, there is no sign of expansion, a little dark purple eyes Calm and waveless, as if nothing has happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Jia Delia can see more with a mysterious taste:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hidden under the skin, not yet completely opened, eye-like flesh and blood; pain and madness in the fast-moving spiritual body; swimming around the innumerable imaginary things that are difficult to describe the form; separated from the room, cleaned the deck Sailors...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything within a few tens of meters is unobstructed but confusingly presented in her horizons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the day she became the sequencer of the "Astrology", she has greatly improved her ability to "see the secret". She also vaguely sees a heavy shadow around her. Thick curtains, after the curtain, there seems to be something watching her, watching all the creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no trace of influence by Mr. Fool, this reverse illustrates a lot of questions...He, no, He directly pulls my spiritual body into that mystery The ability of space is different, tyrannical, and secretive. It is not the scepter of the semi-god-level scepter.... Although he wears fashionable clothes, it does not explain any problems. For this level of existence, different people It’s very simple to present a different image in your eyes, and his true appearance is likely to make every direct-seeker die out of control... Jia Delia stares at herself in the mirror and silently recalls what has just happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the identity of Mr. Fool, she inevitably has some speculation, but this can only be speculation, no evidence of speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He does not mean that he is young when he wears a dovetail dress. It is not long before he was born. Maybe his essence is ancient, older than the Seven Gods, those chasing after Knowledge tells me that before the Cataclysm, there was indeed an older god, and He might be one of them.” Jia Delia said silently, turned away from the full-length mirror, walked back to the place where she struggled before, picked it up. Frame glasses falling aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She puts the thick glasses on her nose, obscures the dark purple eyes, and everything that does not belong to normal vision quickly comes from her. "Before" disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gidley is standing there, once again pondering the impact that Mr. "The Fool" and the so-called Tarot will bring to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, there was a tall figure in her mind, and the ear again echoed the words that made me unforgettable:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave it, your destiny is not here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my destiny, Her Majesty? Jia De Li Ya closed her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the fog, in the ancient majestic palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein fingers tapped the edge of the mottled long table, so that the tarot cards above disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is thinking about the follow-up to the "Stars" to join the Tarot:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If There is no other way, I may really want to leave the safe waterway, enter the ocean of the ruins of the gods and wars, to find the song of the mermaid, when, fear the 'fool', can be controlled to some extent by the 'hidden' It is obviously more reliable than the iceberg Lieutenant General Edwina, and it is safer to borrow her ships... Well, Mr. 'Inverted Man' is an alternative.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "'Stars above' is a member of the Morse Abstinence Society. It has a lot of knowledge. This will be very helpful for Tarot. But for me, there are certain hidden dangers. The image of Mr. Fool's is established. On the basis of inscrutable... Afterwards, I have to be more cautious and resolutely not to answer the questions that I don’t understand. When I am not sure, I would rather be ambiguous, even using a god-like approach. Of course, I have to solve similar problems completely. Must upgrade as soon as possible and become a high-ranking strong as soon as possible. To force worthy level to level worthy of Person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After I got the 'Poseidon Scepter', I don't have to worry that such Tarot members are too strong and prone to problems.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that one day in the future,' On top of the star, 'this Moss acquaintance member can be an important helper for my revenge on the 'hidden sage'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein breathed a sigh of relief and disappeared into the fog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, the bottom of the Church of St. Seychelles.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One wearing red The value of the glove was held by a telegraph and entered the temporary office assigned to them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, there was something happening in the port of Enmat. "He was a little excited about the "Soul of the Soul" Soest Road.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soest touched the right hairline:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the situation? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The new situation of the ‘fool’, the ‘fool’ that the Aurora will look for. The team member holding the telegram handed the paper in his hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His answer suddenly attracted the attention of several red gloves, including the corner. Lift the chair upside down, rest your feet on the table, cover the face, like a black-haired green man in a nap.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soest took the telegram, aiming At first glance, he suddenly smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Someone lied to be his leader, attempting to defraud, and after mourning his name, he was spotlighted by a flash Sudden death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is really a hidden existence called 'fool'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and two The Tarot ritual and the "fool" related files have been handed over to Soest's Red Gloves squad, who are responsible for the investigation, but there is no clue about this, they do not pay attention, because there are other tasks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ‘fool’ has the power of lightning?” Leonard Mitchell took off the black hat on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who knows? If he is the embodiment of an old friend, he can do something similar in advance, and this can be done in the past. There is no precedent, especially the false gods on the southern continent and the colonial islands. Oh, the liar lied that the 'fool' is the embodiment of the 'master of the storm'. This may be the reason why he was killed by the thunder, not other methods of death. Souter leisurely threw the telegram aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard glanced at him, put away his feet, half body, whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Do you want to check it out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you find it? Do you pretend to be an ignorant and mourn his name?" Soest laughed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big probability to catch the tail of the "fool", but I basically bid farewell to the world, my "nightmare" digestion progress is good, just again I got a good thing, there are a lot of sequences waiting for me in front, where do I have to sleep? Leonard smashed down the hairline:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you find a few prisoners to try?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he can't respond at all." Soest shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the two cases involving the Tarot ritual, I feel more and more that this is related to the 'fool'. First, the 'fool' itself is the tower. Luo's main card, and secondly, the organization that seeks or says that the other is the apocalypse, and the first case involving the Tarot ceremony is the Llanus case, and the attempt of the Aurora to let the 'real creator' come is thus destroyed. "Lennadra pulled the black vest and got up and said." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soest seriously thought:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The clues of other cases just broke Now, we have nothing to do, but you can try to check two Tarot rituals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
