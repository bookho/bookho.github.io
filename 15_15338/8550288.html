			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the puppet was painted with a red-yellow oil paint as a common clown, with high-pitched corners on both sides, giving a very funny smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its mouth open, revealing the dark and deep mouth inside, and Klein’s sweaty roots facing it, his heart suddenly appeared. There is no strong fear of cause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gloom that he saw before him was like watching the world in thick brown glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s thoughts are slow and slow, he instinctively wants to ask for help, but the neck is like a rope tied firmly, can’t make a little sound, that Words can only stay in meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he noticed that he was suddenly stunned by the sudden movement of his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown glass in front of Klein’s eyes was broken, and the word “help” in his throat spit out, echoing in the carriage, with a slightly sharp panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's stronger." Klein stated in a positive tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the strange seal of "2-049" stayed in it, it would be a little bit of a serious crisis, no, it is impossible to prevent it. , can only rely on other ways to evade! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is normal." Al-Hasson speaks calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luoluta chuckled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to like you? Rest assured It is a relatively less dangerous one of the 2 seals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the natural lazy voice, the joints are as clear as one-to-one correspondence The human puppet stood up and wobbled to the left side of himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's full of hardships, like a steam machine that has been rusty for a long time and forgot to add lube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robot Dance... Klein Horan flashed these Chinese and had new speculations about the dangers of "2-049":<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it assimilate the creature it controls? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I haven’t been able to wake up in time, would it be a regular puppet, a real version of Barbie? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein’s thoughts were mixed, Al Hasen was awakened by Dunn, bending his arms and pointing at the direction in which the puppet was moving slowly, driving Leonard Road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard can't make the carriage Through the building, I had to go around half a lap. In the process, "2-049" constantly adjusted the direction of the advancement and toughly acted as "the needle of the Antignus family." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Klein, who constantly "moves" his arms, wants to laugh in the tension:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that '2-049' was made by the Antignus family... Is it a faithful performance, or a model of potholes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, in the sound of Al Hasson from time to time, Leonard drove the carriage through the street and headed straight in a certain direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the strange puppet "2-049" will be picked up by Al Hasson each time he gets to the edge of the carriage and start over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time, its mouth will open wider, and two people will be under control at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tension in Kline’s heart gradually eased, and he felt that the seal “2-049” was not so terrible, as long as there were more than three people on the scene, as long as they knew how to keep it. In the flexion and extension exercise, as long as you master the skills of waking up your companions in time, "2-049" is only a special puppet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few laps, confirming that "2-049" wanted to go to the innermost gray-white warehouse, Al-Hassen looked serious and carefully grabbed it and stuffed the strange puppet into the iron black box. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uninterrupted violent percussion, Al Hasen wakes up again and again with the help of Borgia and Lorotta, hard to buckle The mechanical switch was turned on, then poured into the spirit, driving the stars and the red moon symbol on the iron box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible seal reproduction, Al. Hassan took a long breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get off the bus." Dunn Smith’s low-pitched voice followed, "Leonard, you will be here with your horses." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six gentlemen and ladies wearing windbreakers, or formal attire, or shirts left the carriage and headed towards the innermost warehouse, as they walked, almost Tightly and flexibly stretched his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This adds a bit of fun and absurdity to the slightly cohesive tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Night of the Night Dance Company... Klein can only use the spit to alleviate this feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not doing this, because according to his observation, the influence of "2-049" firstly reflected in the upper body, in order to find out in time, avoid slipping into the In a dangerous situation, there are only a few options for flexing your arms, turning your neck, and shaking your body. The latter two will make people look like a little punk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for blinking and browing, it is either too easy to be ignored or too large, and it is not a good choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dance troupe is better than the old and blue in Causeway Bay... Klein sighed and eagerly followed Captain Dunn and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closer he is to the warehouse door, the deeper his worries and worries are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because no one knows what changes this note will bring to Riel Bieber! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a big problem, Klein can't hope to cross it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the usual meat cutting, he found that he still hurts, will bleed, the healing speed of the wound is also normal, not the kind of fear Not afraid of playing monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking around, Dunn suddenly pushed the empty hand down, letting everyone stop at the warehouse door ten meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein, it's better to know if there is danger in your divination, and it's better to figure out the danger." Dunn turned to Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gray eyes are still quiet, not seeing a little fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein nodded invisibly, stopped flexing and stretching, extended his right hand to the left cuff, and untied the silver chain with a citrine pendant inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because his arm is moving, when he is in a sluggish situation, he is discovered by Dunn in time and wakes up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein held the silver chain with his left hand, letting the citrine fall naturally, while controlling the right hand, only doing small flexion and extension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the citrine is stable, he closes his eyes halfway, outlines the ball of light, enters the state of meditation, and quietly meditates:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is danger in the warehouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is danger in the warehouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven times, he opened his eyes and saw the citrine pendant slowly circle and started a clockwise movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned more and more urgent, and in the end there was a feeling of pulling Klein’s left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Clockwise is affirmation of meditation, counterclockwise is negative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other extraordinary people, even if it is a "sneak peek", using the "spirit method" can also detect whether there is danger or not. Get information on the level of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Klein found himself using the "spiritual pendulum", the pendants showed a grading of the speed of rotation, which showed the difference in the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not accurate enough, it is very vague, but it also allows people to roughly distinguish the specific situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a divination potion... Klein is very pleased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was about to close the citrine pendant, Leonard Mitchell, who remained silent behind, suddenly spoke:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Re-divination is not dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am worried that the secret will refuse to give up and keep staring With Riel Bieber’s home, and then followed us, the key moments were messed up.” Dunn nodded in agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein immediately took a breath and re-entered the ethereal calm state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the silver chain regained its stability, he silently said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is danger around." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is danger around."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; repeated over and over again, Klein stared at the silver chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his dark brown eyelids, the citrine pendant was difficult to move counterclockwise, then suddenly paused and turned clockwise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is danger around." Klein’s heart tightened and he cautiously opened his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there are people who try to interfere with divination, but in this invisible confrontation, lose to yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice just fell, and suddenly a fist-sized orange fireball flew in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It slammed into the center of the crowd at a very fast speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng Smith, who had pulled out the long-tube revolver before Klein’s divination, immediately raised his hand and pulled the trigger in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the gunshots, the fireball did not shake at all, still following the predetermined trajectory, seemingly forced everyone to disperse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Klein was not too concerned about tracking the troubled, because there are six extraordinary, even the strongest of sequence 8, sequence 7, in Tingen Such a small place in the city belongs to a configuration that can be traversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fireball came, he suddenly realized a fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that for the person and others, the most dangerous enemy is not the tracker, not the troublemaker, or even the Riel in the warehouse who does not know what the situation is. Bieber, but the seal "2-049"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you are waiting for someone to spread out, get into battle, and have no time to wake each other, you will become a real puppet one by one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the idea flashed, Klein was taken over by Leonarda, followed by the other side and shunned the fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no time to feel the pain of his clothes. He saw that the nights were divided into two groups to avoid, quite methodical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
