			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancient palace above the fog, "Attack" Alger is not in a hurry to mention the "Crazy Captain" Connor Victor. Side by side, look to the side of the "sun" road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you still in the afternoon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Dairick nodded honestly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we have used a long time to set up a camp, and then in a group joint way, a Streets clear the remnants of the monsters, looking for all kinds of ancient traces that may exist, although this will be slow, but safe enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered very detailed And showed the attitude of "inverted people" if you want to know more and no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey listened with great interest and lifted the small hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You have been in the town for so long, what is the food for? Is there black grass nearby?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She listened to the little "sun" very early It is mentioned that Silver City is continued as a staple food by planting black grass in the surrounding area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have a part of the black-skinned ground powder, but the main source of food is the monsters that are hunted, and a large part of them, as long as Precipitated extraordinary characteristics, peeled off the fur, burned with flame, can be eaten, but they all have certain pollution, which will lead to mental problems, can not be continuously ingested, need sufficient spacing." "The sun Dairik seriously answered the question of Miss Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey recalled several dark deep monsters mentioned by the little "Sun" and thought about the horrible horror of the area where Silver City is located. Style, can not help but ask one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This will not be disgusting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "magician" Foers, who is listening to the dialogues of other members, was inspired by this question, deliberately did not go to see the "Moon" Emlin, and curiously asked the "Sun" Dairik:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember you said that the dark monsters contain vampires, they are pussy, ugly, then, after killing such a vampire, you will use it as food "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to this question, Emlin completely forgot to correct the other party is a blood family is not a vampire, his face is green, but inexplicably it is difficult to describe A sense of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derick was silent for two seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some monsters are really disgusting, very Disgusting, like the vampire mentioned by Miss 'Magician', but we have no choice but to eat as long as we can eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is gradually low It seems that I once again deeply felt the cursed tragedy that enveloped the entire Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another silence in the palace of the giant residence, even the "moon" Emlin, who wanted to refute the "sun" Dairik’s words, did not speak. Just licked his mouth and shrank his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, "World" broke the silence, and laughed aloud:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Let's go back to the sea. Recently, there is something worth paying attention to. 'The mad captain' Connor. Victor's 'single-eyed nickname' floated near the pier after a storm. The mast was broken and burnt marks were everywhere. All the crew members, including Connors Victor himself, have died and no one has been spared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey and others are not clear "Crazy Captain "Who is not too interested in this news, just a little curious as to why such a shipbreaking tragedy will happen." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking down" Alger's feelings are quite different from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "World" has paid close attention to the "Crazy Captain" incident, and there is no secret behind it! It is no wonder that Lord Courtman will solemnly issue an order to let the "deceiver" and "Captain Sailor" investigate the relevant situation! Alger’s eyelids are slightly moving, thinking a little:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I don’t have to entrust it separately... Klein gave a sneer and asked the “world” to ask: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What clues does the Storm Church have?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I will try to understand." "Inverted people" Alger calmly shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that "the world" can understand his own meaning, that is, I really don't know now, but I will inquire inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curiously listening to the "justice" Audrey more and more feel that the "crazy captain" is not simple, try to open the way:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. 'World', isn't this a common pirate guilt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is trying to perfunct Miss "Justice" Sentence, do not reveal more, suddenly considered a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Bakerland smog incident and the disappearance of the population may be hiding behind a certain faction of the royal family, as well as some military personnel, and Miss 'Justice' is Emotions and positions naturally favor the aristocrats to the royal family. If one day, I will entrust her with the corresponding tasks for those who should be cursed to be hanged, she may not be willing to accept, and may even fall into the inner contradiction... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, now I have to instill a little bit of impressions of the royal family and the military with many bad people, subtly changing her position and emotional bias, This can take the risk of exposing some of the information in the 'world'..." Kline thought for a moment, letting the "world" tone say with a little sarcasm:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The 'Crazy Captain' is related to the disappearance of the colonial population investigated before Mr. 'Inverted Man'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The witch sect will hand over the deceived or plundered population to the external forces such as 'Sick Lieutenant' Trey, who will be transported to the east coast of the Northern Continent. With the final distance of the 'Crazy Captain' Connors Victor, the pirate has close ties with many traffickers and slave traders in Lun.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I In January, I told Mr. Mr. 'Inverted Man' that there was a news that some people who witnessed the disappearance of the case had met with the military personnel who were loyal to the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, Beckland's largest trafficker, Kapyeong, has a 'arbitrator' approach to protectors.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So many things are added together, do you still think that the death of 'Crazy Captain' is a simple pirate guilt? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I have been thinking, what do you want to do with so many slaves behind the scenes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The clear connection between the clues is presented in the hearts of "Justice" Audrey and "Inverted" Alger and others, so that they suddenly understand a lot of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. "World" left Beckland and went to the sea to track the clues. He has been investigating the truth about the smog and the death of Prince Edessac. ! According to the contents he provided, it is obvious that the real murderer has not been punished, and he is still hidden inside the king's room, and some military personnel are working for him. It is really hateful! This kind of person should be thrown into hell! Uh... How can Mr. "World" know that the protector around Kapyeong is the extraordinary person of the "arbitrator" approach? Have they dealt with it? Ao Lili’s thoughts fluttered in the air, and there was a sudden association: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaping was killed by the Grand Theft Auto "Black Emperor", the latter clearly clear Kapyeong Which route does the protector belong to;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grand Theft "Black Emperor" is the leader of Mr. "Footer";<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Mr. "World" is suspected to have a certain connection with Mr. "The Fool". He has never collected the diary of Russell the Great; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. "World" is the "Black Emperor" of the Grand Theft Auto, the leader of Mr. "Folly"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not submit the diary of Russell the Great because he submitted it privately? Some of his previous performances were to hide the identity of the latter? Is this the test of Mr. "fool"? It’s really hard to connect Mr. "World" with Grand Theft Auto "Black Emperor". The latter is more like a hero... Audrey feels that he has found the truth and is beginning to curious about Mr. "World", that is, Grand Theft Auto "Black Emperor" "What kind of person is in reality." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader is tracing the truth about the Bakerland smog! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hidden things behind this are the "fool" Mr. interested! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Magic" of Beckland and "Moon" Emlin also consciously noticed something from the "world" After all, the legend of Grand Theft Auto "Black Emperor" has become quite popular in the past six months, and has become an important role in many popular novels. Even Fols himself wants to write a love story of Grand Theft Auto and Miss Aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They finally understand why the "world" was able to detect in time that there will be a big event in Beckland, and it is likely that there will be a tragedy because the gentleman has been Trace the corresponding clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Beckland’s business is far from over, and there may be accidents in the future... I really want to leave immediately, but I’m sure I’m not willing or The law explained to her... Fuls had the idea of ​​fleeing Beckland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Moon" Emlin is not too scared. In his opinion, there is a disaster, and the blood family also has a big man in Beckland, which can certainly provide blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for two seconds, "downside down" Alger solemnly said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will Try to investigate this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already predicted that there is a terrible storm behind the death of "The Captain of the Crazy", so there is some fear and fear, but not Lack of excitement and trepidation in participating in the most important events in the North and South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Hidden" Jia Delia was quietly listening and clicked on the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I The corresponding news will also be collected.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there are more clues available, maybe I can help." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought about it and let the "world" say calmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Crazy Captain On the night of his death, he had a high-ranking strongman on the ship suspected of the 'black emperor' route, but the demigod managed to escape before Yann Courtman arrived. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Emperor" approach, demigod...Alger and Jia Delia at the same time chewing these words, thinking about where to start.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice" Audrey and others are amazed that Tarot will develop from discussing the demigod to directly participating in the semi-god related events, which is really getting more and more high-end, as for " The Sun" Dairik, did not understand the whole process.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Crazy Captain" was temporarily behind, "The Hidden" Jia Delia looked at the eyes "World", deliberately mentioned: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is one more thing at sea. Last week, the crazy adventurer, German Sparrow, hunted the king of immortality. 'The second deputy, 'slaughter' Gilthias, this is the extraordinary of the sequence 5. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great!" At present, only the "Magic" of the sequence 8 is inspiringly praised, she is very clear what exactly the sequence 5 represents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it’s a legendary adventurer. "Justice" Audrey followed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moon" Emlin opened his mouth and closed again, feeling that he was still very far from this level. Far.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inverted" Alger said nothing unusual:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because This matter, the investigation of the origins of German Sparrow has become an important task for major organizations. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you mean that the Storm Church also lets you investigate me? Klein understands the meaning of Mr. "downside down" and makes the "world" Low smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know where to get this commission? I want to get money with some unimportant information. I still know something about Galman Sparo. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
