			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weak Sharon showed a painful expression under the scream of "Resentment" Steve, but she still struggled to close the palm of her hand and let The wonderful light that was emitted there was interrupted momentarily, and the mysterious and illusory bronze door disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein knows bad, busy with a headache, step back, into the fire, his figure quickly disappears, flashing in another direction Suddenly violent explosion in the afterglow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just jumped out and sought a counterattack, but the middle-aged man Steve, who saw the dark red cloak, did not chase himself, but stopped in place. As if waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was so upset that his head was dizzy and his stomach was groaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly became weak, but did not know why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric, who had just slowed down from the screaming, also had an abnormality. He continued to reach out and grab himself. It seemed that there was an uncontrollable itching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He panted, scratching his clothes with sharp, sharp nails, grabbing a trace of white on his body, and getting deeper and deeper, I saw a little red leaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon fell to the ground, but couldn’t stand up, her blue eyes gradually lost focus, as if nothing could be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poison..." She whispered the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Resentment" not far from her, Steve glanced at the palm of her grip, and was full of mysterious patterns, full of inability to describe The bronzed illusion of the taste seems to be quite taboo, and it did not hit the ground directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His right hand holds a blushing full moon like a blizzard of "dark red moonlight", and the left palm takes out a brown translucent glass vial from the pocket. One channel: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Biotoxin bottles can be randomly made with different toxins, and as long as they are opened, they will gradually diffuse into the surrounding area."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will take less than a minute, and then the symptoms will become more and more serious. After four minutes, if you have not left the toxin-filled environment, the corresponding consequences will not be resistant. For example, death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, I thought Jason could support it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Sharon, you will not be affected, the spirit is not afraid of poisoning, but unfortunately, there is a 'deep red moon', you can not transform the state."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or, you can give up and let me realize the charm of your hidden."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks like a leisurely Shao ability to proceed in the magical items, such as Klein seems to want to completely lose their power of resistance and then do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Tyre, who had prepared in advance, did not understand his intentions and did not hesitate to lose the rational "wolfman" under the influence of "Crimson Moon". The counterattack was launched, and the front flapped, the claws waved, and the body of Maric was torn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;锵! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of nails scratching the steel plate sounded one after another, and there were finally several wounds on the skin in front of Maric that could directly see the flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pinched his forehead and felt that it was already hot, but the negative effects were not as serious as the "results" Steve said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the "sun brooch" that constantly purifies and expels the surrounding evils weakens the toxins... Klein suddenly snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want us to get rid of it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think that I didn't use fireworks just now, relying on explosives? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So many explosions have definitely caught the attention of others, the official extraordinary people in the vicinity are coming, you have no time!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve looked sideways at the face and painted with oil, and it was difficult to identify the clear-looking Klein, and suddenly laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I forgot that there is a bug that can be easily solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, before the church people come, you must have died..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice did not fall, Klein suddenly raised the right hand of the revolver, shot a "purification bullet." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve's footsteps are nudged, it is already a few meters across the road, along the way, the afterimage remains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Klein’s bullet did not shoot at his original location, but hit the center of the open space, pierced the soil, and made a sound. When the movement! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual breeze blew, and Maric’s living corpse and Steve’s shadows were still at rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the moment, they rushed out insanely and rushed to the center of the open space, like a group of hungry dogs who had arrived at the meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a different way to control Klein, and Steve, who is easily killed, first stunned and immediately revealed a puzzled and amazed expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time he has discovered that his own driving spirit will be out of control for no reason! At the same time, Klein slammed his fingers and detonated several bombs, which allowed different places to ignite a red flame that leaped into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His figure quickly jumped in these fires and flashed outside the open space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to run!" Steve whispered, imagining the figure, catching up with the target, but found that the living corpses and shadows dug a square The iron box is grabbing the items inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, a shadow succeeded and the body expanded, seemingly wisely flew away in the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s time to delay my actions with that item and succeed in running away... Well, he doesn’t know enough about “resentment” and “deep red moon” ! Steve temporarily gave up the plan to catch up with Klein, put away the "biotoxin bottle", the body suddenly disappeared, appeared on a thin ice condensed by the water, and then relied on the horrible speed of dragging the afterimage two steps Behind the huge shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green glow of Steve’s eyes flashed, and the shadow suddenly disappeared silently, and the items in his hand slammed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the living corpses and shadows completely disregarded the pressure of the superiors, rushing over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve became more and more surprised and strange, and found that his spiritual foreboding could not get any revelation from the item that caused the corpse and the shadows to riot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He crossed the front of his body and caught the item with his left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a dark gold-colored key ring with an old, exquisite copper whistle hanging from the side of the copper whistle Brass key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stood side by side, clinging to each other, lying in Steve’s pale palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Steve’s right-handed “Crimson Moonlight” is quietly emitting a blush, like a full moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve still has other ideas in the future, a faint illusory but very strange voice plunged into his mind, tearing his nerves , peeling off his scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve screamed and fell directly from mid-air On the ground, the "dark red moon" held in his hand and the ring with the copper whistle and the key were thrown away by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struggled and twisted in his place, and his body bulged one after another, with a small hair like a baby’s arm, or a stinking stench. Light yellow liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a cluster of flames re-ignited, and Klein, who had "escaped", jumped out and blocked the trajectory of "Crimson Moon". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not try to catch this magical item, but a light one, let it turn around and flew to the weak and weak Sharon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve’s crying voice gradually became smaller, and “Crimson Moonlight” fell accurately on Sharon’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon’s figure immediately vanished, and the blue eyes that lost focus were instantly recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gripped her right palm and held the palm-sized ornament with a circle of dark rubies in her left hand, and the body floated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crimson Moonlight" allows the holder to immunize the full moon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon is no longer weak! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she is not afraid of "biotoxins" in the spirit state! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the living corpses and the shadows gathered together to snatch the Azick copper whistle and the master key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't care, stretched out his left hand, raised his arm and pointed it there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sunbird ornament on his chest, the dark gold shines, and a strong bright sacred light descends from the sky, shrouded in a rush of life. The corpse and the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light, the transparent and strange shadows melted and disappeared quickly, and a pale, stinky living corpse first appeared black smoke, and then Burned up like a candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dawn disappears, there is almost nothing left, only the ancient and exquisite Azick copper whistle and the quaint universal keychain in the blackened circle On the ring, lying there quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Sharon did not manage Maric, who was seriously injured under the attack of "Werewolf" Tyre, but relied on his own differences in mirror items. Jumping ability, came to the thin ice that Steve used before, and then stepped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stretched out the gripped right palm against Steve, who was becoming a monster, and slammed it open, letting the palm of the enemy aim at the enemy ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless brilliance bursts out and quickly intertwines into the bronze door that is covered with mysterious symbols and patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the toothy voice, the black cap of Sharon’s head was blown off by the sudden blowing of the wind, and the hair was brushed with a touch of light gold hair. The messy draped down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, using that magical item again made her quite strenuous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious bronze door cracked a gap, and the laughter, the crying, the shouting echoed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strip or the arm full of teeth, or no skin, rushed out and grabbed the pustules one by one, Steve . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-and-black vines and the slick tentacles that highlight the baby's face are also entangled in the strong 5 of the sequence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve called out again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale yellow liquid that flowed out of the pustule covered his whole body, which made him reluctantly resist the pull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face cracked with a bright red gap, and there was a hole in the darkness like a tunnel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein had lifted the revolver and aimed at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No delay, no hesitation, disguise on his face, and Klein, who wore a half-high silk hat, calmly pulled the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the flash of the "sun brooch", two bullets full of sacred meaning hit Steve's head accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they failed to penetrate the skin and bones, they ignited the flames of the cockroaches and made Steve a bright torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
