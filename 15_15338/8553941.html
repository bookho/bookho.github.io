			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Killing you? For the first time, Klein heard this request. When he encountered such a task, he did not know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even began to wonder if there would be a big plot in this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Utravovsky opened his eyes and looked down on Klein Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lost my past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Mr. Father, don’t talk too much... Klein’s mouth twitches slightly, and asks: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even in myths and legends, no one can go back to the past. You can only complete this commission, and only seven gods can complete it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I mean, killing the past that is still hidden in my heart and never really died." Bishop Utławski saw that Klein still had some puzzles. I used to love killing and madness in fighting. I didn’t completely die with my inner regrets. I can clearly feel that he is still living in my body and always wants to take back control of everything. I am suppressing him all the time, hoping to use mass, use asceticism, use preaching to influence him, and let him truly believe in the teachings of the mother god. I belong to one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, the past imprint is too deep, and the current life conflicts fiercely, thus creating a division of personality... pseudo psychology The true keyboard master, Klein Moretti, made a preliminary judgment and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a psychological problem, I think you are the most What you need is a psychiatrist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I tried, you may not know, in the extraordinary way the mother god has, there is a sequence of 'physicians' , that is, the ancient 'therapist priests', they have studied my problems, think that this is not a simple mental illness, but also mixed with the tendency to get out of control, if, in the past, I finally defeated the present, I will no doubt lose control , will become a monster." Uttrafsky sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sequence of "audience" pathways, "Psychologist"... Klein thought: <br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your words make me believe that you have found a solution, just missing a suitable performer, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, these years, in addition to preaching, I am still looking for people and things that can help me. Finally, under the blessing of the goddess, I got a very magical item, which is said to be a certain article in the old age. The relics of the dragon.” Uttrasky saw that Klein was not scared away, replied with some hope. “It allows the holder to enter the deepest part of the target mind, or the bottom of the dream. And materialize the corresponding scene, so that you can directly see the past me, and then destroy him through battle. In that special state, once he really dies, he will not appear again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a mysterious world, and it’s also possible to treat personality splits in this way... Ryan secretly sighed and cautiously asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What restrictions does this have, or what harm will it cause to the holder? Why do you think I can't finish? This commission?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Utravsky bishop looked down at Klein Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Once the magical item is used, the holder itself will remain awake, but the mind or the dream has many layers. In the past, I can make full use of this to deceive you, and even in turn to kill you, after more than the scheduled time. Well, five minutes, that magical item will make you completely lost, and the spirit can no longer return to the body and become its sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" As a result, you will become a vegetative."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, because of the essence of the scene, if you are in the deepest part of the mind, or the bottom layer of the dream is killed There will be similar sequelae, which is equivalent to real death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trust me I used to be much stronger than you expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way...but your question is not a problem for me, I can Psychic and dreamy people who keep themselves awake and rational, even if the magical item wants me to be completely lost, don't worry too much. As long as there is room for struggle, I can go back four steps and mourn the name, directly Going above the fog... The question is, how strong is the Uttrasky bishop in the past, and how big is my grasp of defeating him? What are the restrictions and taboos in the actual spiritual world? Klein thought for a while:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"French Uttraski, how powerful are you in the past? I don't think I will lose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Bishop Utravovsky I stunned it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have come to this The sequence 6 of the extraordinary path became a 'dawn knight'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original is not the "cultivator" approach... he himself said After committing crimes and becoming pirates, they were influenced by the Mother Earth Church... Sequence 6, um, I am not in a way to win, "Magician" is the type that will be much stronger as long as it is prepared in advance, and Based on my special, deep in the soul or at the bottom of my dreams, it is my home... Klein sinks for a few seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magical item Will it weaken him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but after all, it is the main area of ​​his activities, this kind of weakening will not be too big, at most He has been more like a fiercely fought game. "Ute Musharraf Sharansky recalled previous attempts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I am even bigger... Klein continues to ask:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In that What kind of attention should you pay attention to in a special environment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As with real battles, effective offense is always effective, and hallucinations are still hallucinations, however, It must be noted that he may take you into other layers of dreams at any time, thus creating a situation in which it is difficult to distinguish between true and false." Bishop Utravovsky emphasized, "So, you must at least have sequence 6, or some The special sequence 7, it is possible to complete this commission, and the risk is not small, oh, if I have not vowed on the mother's sacred object, before the mission is successful, don't ask the church for help, things will not be so difficult." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way... I’m not afraid of dreaming in a dream situation... Klein outlines the corner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The last question, what are the characteristics of the 'Dawn Knight' battle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;The Utravsky bishop pulls a wrinkle with a lot of wrinkles, swearing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is for the extraordinary, it needs absolute secrecy "Things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, as long as there are enough battles to participate, others can often sum up, and the more detailed you know, the more likely you are to succeed. High, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Klein nodded calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Utravovsky said in a memory:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dawn Knight owns The power of giants can fill the surrounding forty or fifty meters, and these morning dawns can break the illusion and have a special bit of dispelling the ghosts, even weakening the evil spirits."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can condense the 'Dawn Armor' on the surface, which is equivalent to the refined body armor, but no obvious weight, will not affect the action, if it is destroyed, recovery needs a certain Time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can also condense different weapons, the strongest is a two-handed sword, which is often called "the sword of the morning", sharp , sturdy, every shot has a purifying effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Besides, Dawn Knight has an extraordinary ability to make 'the storm of light' ', it can directly destroy the human body, eliminate the grievances, and hurt the evil spirits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary ability is not too much, I am very restrained, it is a type of attacking strong defense and not afraid of illusion. The good thing is that in addition to facing the shadow of the soul, the mystery of the "Dawn Knight" is very low... Klein is listening in the mind. Introducing the battle, looking for the most sure way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery of his heart is strange, quirky, incredible, and incomprehensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Utravsky looked at him quietly, without urging, not driving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After gradually getting an idea, Klein raised his head and looked up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I I can give it a try, but only if I have to leave for a few minutes to confirm if you are lying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
