			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can call me, fool."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short answer quickly fades away from the grand In the temple and the diffuse fog, but in the hearts of Audrey and Alger, the sound reverberates for a long time, causing a circle of ripples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t think it was the name of this feeling, which perfectly reflected the image of mysterious, powerful, and strange images! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds of silence, Audrey stood up, imagining the skirt, bending her knees, and bowing to Zhou Mingrui:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr. Fool, please allow me to take the pleading, can you be a witness to our transaction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Little things.” Zhou Mingrui thought sharply and replied in an identifiable way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is our privilege, Mr. Fool." Alger also followed up, holding his chest with his right hand and bending over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui's right hand is under pressure, smiles open:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You continue."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger nodded and sat down again, looking at Audrey Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can take Go to the ghost shark blood, then find someone to go to the 'Warriors and Seas' bar in the White Rose District of Plymouth, tell the boss Williams, this is what the 'captain' wants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After I confirm, do you send me the address to send the potion recipe, or let me tell you directly here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey thought for a while, showing a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I chose a more confidential way, right here, although this is a test of my memory "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Mr. Fool promised to witness the transaction, it means that there is a similar "party" next time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about this, she suddenly turned her head and looked at Zhou Mingrui with brilliance, proposing with great interest:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool, do you mind how many times do you try this now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger calmly listened to it, it was also a heartbeat , busy with the road: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Fool, don't you think this 'party' is very interesting? Although your power transcends our imagination, but the world There is always an area where you don't know what you are not good at. The opposite is obviously a noble lady. I also have my own experience, insights, channels and resources. I and she may be able to help you at some point in the future. It’s a trivial matter that is convenient for you to do.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, since he will be pulled in without any defense and no resistance, it means taking the initiative. The right is in the hands of the mysterious Mr. Fool, not wanting to refuse to think about not participating in the "party", it will be successful, so, Better to dig deeper to better benefit the encounter with the harvest to make up for passive and negative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three parties at the long table have different backgrounds, different resources, different news channels, different mysterious fields to understand, if they can communicate with each other, limited cooperation, Produce wonderful effects that cannot be estimated and measured! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the exchange of resources just set, for example, if you want to kill a person, you can ask for "party members" who have no relationship with themselves. This will make things perfectly misguided in the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A noble lady... My performance, is my accent so obvious? Audrey's mouth was half a bit, and she stunned, but she quickly returned and nodded without hesitation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Fool, I think this is A good proposal, as long as the 'party' becomes regular, there are things, if you are not convenient to come forward, you can transfer it to us, of course, within our capabilities."<br /><br />&nbsp ;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning, Zhou Mingrui is weighing the pros and cons, more "party" can really make himself gain more extraordinary mystery and occult knowledge, help to cross back in the future, such as the next " The "viewer" this potion formula that should appear when the party is gathering, the same, can also get news for the current real life, get some help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the more "party" is, the more likely it is to expose its own reality! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, no matter which world, there is no only good thing... Zhou Mingrui once again extended his right hand and tapped the edge of the long table with his finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that the gathering and dismissal of "party" are under their control, even if they expose any problems, they are within the controllable range, and the benefits are obviously greater than the drawbacks. Zhou Mingrui quickly made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed his movements and smiled at the four expectation and sly eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am a person who likes the exchange of equivalents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "I will not let you help unconditionally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Every Monday, 3 pm, try to be alone, wait for me to try a few times, figure out some things, maybe you can take time off in advance, don't worry about being in an inappropriate situation."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This even promised Alger and Audrey's proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey was just seventeen years old and has been cared for. The girl’s heart is very heavy. When she heard Mr. Fool’s answer, she couldn’t help but clench her fists. Slightly placed twice on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we should give ourselves a title? After all, we can't communicate with real names." Not waiting for Alger to open her eyes, she is bright and beautiful. Said vigorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his true situation may not be able to get past Mr. Fool, but the guy opposite is also a bit dangerous, can not let him know who I am! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good idea." Zhou Mingrui answered briefly and easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey immediately brainstormed and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Mr. Fool, From the Tarot card, as a regular, long-term, secret 'party', the title is as consistent as possible, um, I also pick it from the tarot card."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Her tone is slowly getting happy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Decision, my title is, 'justice'!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the twenty-two main cards of the Tarot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about you, Mr.?" Audrey smiled and looked at the opposite "companion." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger slightly frowned, and immediately stretched:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another main card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, then we are the founding members of the Tarot Club!" Audrey was happy to blurt out, then looked a little sullenly to the gray fog. The shrouded Zhou Mingrui, "No problem, Mr. Fool?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui smiled and shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This little thing, you can take your own ideas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!" Audrey was obviously very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she looked at Alger again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you say the address again? I am afraid that my memory is not deep enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Alger was very satisfied with Audrey's seriousness and repeated. Once again the address. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After meditation three times, Audrey was very excited: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The card is only a game invented by Russell the Great. In fact, it does not have the function of divination?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, many times, divination comes from itself, everyone If you have spirituality, you can feel the spiritual world and feel the higher level of relationship with your own information. It is just that ordinary people can't detect this, let alone interpret the obtained 'tips'. When they use divination tools, these The information will be presented with the help of tools, one of the simplest examples, dreams and dreams.” Alger looked at Zhou Mingrui and saw that he did not say it. He said that he denied the statement of Audrey. “Tarot actually belongs to This tool, which uses more symbols and more reasonable elements, helps us to interpret 'tips' more conveniently and accurately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui seems to be careless, but he listens very seriously, but his mental emptiness begins to become serious, and his head is pumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Understood." Audrey nodded and then stressed, "I don't mean this. I am not questioning Tarot. I heard." Russell’s emperor actually produced another deck of cards, which was a hidden card that symbolized some unknown forces. There were a total of twenty-two cards. After completing it, he invented the twenty-two of the Tarot cards. Zhang, the main card, as a game tool, is this statement accurate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Zhou Mingrui and seemed to want to get an answer from the mysterious Mr. Fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui just smiles, does not speak, and turns his gaze to the "upside down man", a test of your appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alger subconsciously straightened his back and said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it is said that Luo Sergei had seen the slate, and the deck of cards contained the mystery of the twenty-two ways of God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty-two ways of God ..." Audrey repeated in a tone full of yearning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Zhou Mingrui’s headache increased and he felt that his invisible connection with the deep red stars and the gray mist began to shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, today's party is here." He immediately decided to open his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow your will." Alger bowed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow your will." Audrey imitates "downside down." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a lot of questions and lots of ideas, and she is completely reluctant to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui broke the link and smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's look forward to The second gathering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Star" is bright again, the deep red light shrinks back like water, Audrey and Alger just heard Mr. "Folly" The words become more blurred and more illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than a second, the "projection" was broken and the silence was restored above the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhou Mingrui feels that he is getting heavier and heavier, surrounded by eclipse, the first is a dark, then the bright sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still in the apartment room, still standing in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dream like... What is the foggy world in the end... Who is it or what kind of power is making the change..." Zhou Mingrui The voice sighed, full of confusion, and the legs seemed to be filled with lead to the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the pocket watch that was placed outside and confirmed how long it had been. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One to one time flow rate." Zhou Mingrui probably judged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the pocket watch, his head is sore and he can no longer support it. He sat down on the chair and lowered his head. He massaged the left thumb and the middle finger separately. Side temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, he suddenly sighed and said in Chinese:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems short I can't go back in time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ignorant can be fearless, seeing such magical things, after learning about extraordinary fields and mysterious worlds, Zhou Mingrui is I dare not to recklessly try the "transportation ceremony" of Guvsack and Lun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghosts know if there will be other situations, maybe even more wonderful, more horrible, and even make people die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least you have to master the mystery before you can try it." Zhou Mingrui reluctantly thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the so-called "party" can help yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another silence, he whispers with frustration, loss, pain, and jealousy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
