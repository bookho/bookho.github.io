Do you think we have been misled?" Icons listened to Klein The words did not ridicule, disdain and contempt, but seriously discussed the problem with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good deacon...but it may be the reason why the mirror called Arrods is often used, and then the sharp temper will be smoothed out. ... Klein sighs with a sigh of relief and sincerely nods: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my personal opinion, out of prudence.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To verify is simple, ask the mirror about the location of the 'desire apostle', not the location of Patrick Jason Beria. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons pressed the hat: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It makes sense. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expression became dignified again, and his eyes turned to the mirror in the palm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Icons deacon, if you ask any clues here, the demon will certainly be able to detect. "Klein reminded me next to it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Also. "Icons said to the two players sideways. "You continue to secretly protect Mr. Moriarty. Even if the 'desire apostle' strikes, the three of you will be able to resist a long time, and there is a military nearby." personnel. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, deacon! "The two members of the "heart of the machine" replied without hesitation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons left immediately and rushed to the night of the night, that is, Essinger. Around Stanton.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Song of God" was opened, and the seal of the Church of Goddess has also been dispatched... "What is the action of the "Apostle of Desire"? It must be this afternoon... I hope I can catch up, I hope that the mirror can give the correct answer... But in this way, I have no chance to blend, I can’t see the demon that harms everyone, I can’t Touching his suitcase full of banknotes, gold bars, gold coins and jewellery... Klein slammed into the back of ICONS.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he Immediately, I recovered my mood:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also good, at least without my risk, I can safely release this crisis.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "Mechanical Heart" will definitely not treat me badly, if it is successful, my views and suggestions must be Very important location, and I am a believer in the god of steam and machinery. According to the style of several churches, I should share a harvest for me... Under the premise of 50,000 pounds, it would not be too little. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Klein couldn’t help but still have some regrets.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he won’t Take a risky blend of this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician" does not perform unprepared performances!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still too Compact, too rushed, didn't give me the time to plan... Klein nodded to the two "Mechanical Hearts" players, walked down the carriage, returned to the Cragg Club, and prepared the waiter to help him open the room. Lounge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilston District, Essinger Stan In the living room of the room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Mitchell gathered his own slightly black hair, following the instructions of Captain Soest, on other nights With the help of the helper Put on the set of silver full body armor dyed with large pieces of blood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled the underside, let the green eyes hide in the darkness of the darkness, then stretched out The left palm of the silver-colored metal glove took over the mirror from Icons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the steam and mechanical church, the silver mirror code is "2-111". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ikonser nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, its harmfulness, not high."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When it comes to the back, he suddenly feels a bit more in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, all other aspects have met the criteria for the '1' seal?" Soest asked thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icons stunned him with a glance:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only some aspects."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would not disclose more information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Leonard gently lifted the surface of the silver mirror with his right hand, and the room was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three times, he whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Arodus, I The question is, where is the “Desire Apostle” attacking Essinger Stanton?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole house is suddenly dark, just like a black cloud just floats Going nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of the silver mirror swells and quickly condenses a slightly blurred picture:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is a luxurious villa-style house with a large garden in front of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the garden, there is a glass greenhouse with a bright red rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glass greenhouse is up, and you can see the pale sun after the mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On Beckland!" Essinger Stanton immediately calculated the location of the picture based on the perspective and the position of the sun in the sky. where. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is completely different from the previous answer to Jason Beria! We were misled!" ICONSER said in a deep voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Soulist" Soest sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is Jason Beria who was pursued by the "Singer of God"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it’s too late to discuss, let’s circle the general information from the screen information, and then immediately start the action. I suspect that the 'desire apostle’ will follow. Make big events!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the silver mirror called Arrods has dissipated the picture and turned into a floating word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It asked Leonard Mitchell to answer a question, and if he lie or is unwilling to answer, he will be severely punished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard is a little nervous, and puts the usual slings away, waiting quietly for the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, he saw bloody words change, one after another:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Whether you are boarding..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem has just finished half, Leonard’s pupil has contracted rapidly, his back is very tight, his forehead is cold and sweaty. Take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is not a set of blood-stained silver armor, others can already find his anomaly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, his left palm was inexplicably shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver mirror is trembled, the bright red words are strangely stained with some green, if not always staring at the mirror and concentrating, others are very It is difficult to find that the color has changed from subtle to extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words continue to wriggle and change the previous question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, that imprint is in my memory." Leonard replied steadily, but his body in the blood-stained silver armor had a kind of tiredness that suddenly relaxed after a high degree of tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mirror is too dangerous... I just noticed it! Fortunately, after so long, the old man has recovered a bit... his lips thought dryly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soest took out his pocket watch and glanced at it, Leonard Road in the blood-stained silver armor:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still time, you will lead the next action!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Captain Soest." Leonard secretly Spit a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Docklands, Beckland Dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick Jason Beria entered the scheduled cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked out of the window and observed the sky filled with mist and mist, counting the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he quickly took off his hat, took off his clothes, then reached out and pulled the layer of skin on the surface! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the human skin, it turned out to be a gorgeous woman, in her early thirties, her eyebrows were deep, not the kind of brown that Klein saw in "Dream Divination" Brown man! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman took out her clothes and dressed them in an orderly manner, quickly becoming a charming and charming stunner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, she flipped through the bottom of the suitcase and found a fist-sized stone statue, wrapped it with a layer of peeled leather. And hit a knot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all this, the inland passenger ship has traveled a distance. She opened the window and threw Patrick Jason’s human skin along with the stone statue to the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who binds the heavy object sinks quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman clapped her hands, closed the window, carried the suitcase, and changed to a prepared cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, she sat next to the window of the new cabin, with her elbows on the table, her hands on her face, and leisurely looking out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, she saw a gust of wind blowing in the air, blowing the mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of her mouth evokes and her smile is bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jowood District, a building not far from the Holy Wind Cathedral Luxury villa type house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waist is swollen, the gray-blue Pallas Nigan bear hugged the mistress, who was a little innocent on his face. Beautiful girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people next to him, one is a middle-aged man in a black tuxedo, with brown eyes and blue eyes, no expression, it is provided by the Storm Church. The Extraordinary Guard, a sequence 6 "Winner." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is the secretary of the Duke of Nigan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a thin, eye-catching blond young man who looks gentle and calm, and his biggest drawback is that the hairline has retreated beyond age. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for other guards, or security personnel, they are scattered outside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upstairs to the second floor, the "Winner" grabbed the Duke of Nigan before entering the bedroom, went in and checked it quickly, while the secretary of the Duke of Nigan Responsible for searching the surrounding rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there was no problem, they nodded to the Duke of Nigan, indicating that he could continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
