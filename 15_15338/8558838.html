			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admiral Levitte...the real demigod... heard Bilt’s explanation, Klein’s mind instantly popped two words :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, goodbye!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Greman. Sparo is less obvious Picking an eyebrow, Bilt quickly explained:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This does not affect the difficulty of the task.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No one here needs a half god to show their strength. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cleared his throat and put up a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to make this mission It became less difficult. General Admiral specially arranged for the inspection of the Olavy naval base in recent days, so that he did not need to stay in the Naval Base Camp of the Central Sonia Sea, 'The City of Generosity' Baiyam, Thus avoiding 'Sea King' Yann Courtman, avoiding the Governor of the Rhodes Islands, George Nigan, avoiding most of his subordinates who are familiar with him, avoiding the relatives who run the family business there, avoiding the one who is most familiar with him. A mistress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, you don't have to face the demigod's eyes, you don't have to face a lot of tests.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here, there are only three of you who are familiar with Admiral. One is his secretary, Lieutenant Luer Ann. He belongs to the MI9 and has the responsibility of supervising Admiral. He should have used many names. I don't know if this is his real name. The second is the mistress of the general here, a beautiful lady named Cynthia. Her ancestors are said to be nobles, deprived of the title, exiled here, and the third is Olavi. Governor of the University of Oston Levitt, he is the younger brother of the Lord, the Count of Levitt in the House of Lords is their brother. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds really not that difficult, and my divination results show that it is not too dangerous... Klein is silent for a few seconds, and gently sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need more information about Amyrius Levitt. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are ready, this is his photo, this is the physical description of his hidden place, this is his accent feature, this is him The habit of using words, this is his different reactions and attitudes towards different events. This is the detailed content of his relationship with Rueran, Cynthia, Auston and others..." Bilt’s heart was happy, and he immediately took out the source. A lot of information about Admiral Levitte Livette.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein first took the photo and saw the middle-aged man with dark blue eyes, temperament Serious and old-fashioned, the volume is much more than the average Lun man.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded invisibly, then raised his head.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know a lot of this information, but I am sure you can remember it in these two days, you must be very professional in this regard..." Bilt's voice has not fallen, has been subconscious Take a step back, because he is no longer in front of Galman Sparo, but Amyrius Levitt, the serious and dark Arrogant and I did not really feel a little difference <br /> <br /> & nbsp;! & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "storm in, this, this near-miracle! "Bilter looked up and down and couldn't help but sigh." However, the height can be three centimeters more, the legs are thicker, it doesn't matter, don't worry so much, the general will follow the Royal Navy in the Soviet Union. The first fleet of the fleet arrived and inspected the Olavy Naval Base in the afternoon and hosted a dinner at the Government House. I have an invitation to take you in, to watch your manners and attitudes when communicating with different people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, he took the 500 pounds of cash that Sotos took out of the safe and handed it to Klein Road:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy cooperation! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a look at the banknotes and examined a few words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckland, Williams Street.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a lesser-minded member of the red glove, Leonard Mitchell stood back against the outer wall of a house, waiting for the initial trial of the site to end.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he saw a teammate returning to the side, his expression was quite complicated, both excited and puzzled, both expecting and nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thomson, is there a result?" Leonard moved in his heart and smiled and moved closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Townsend nodded and replied calmly. "There are explanations on both sides. They can't lie in their dreams."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sparsely sparsed Townsend re-appeared to the hat:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The content they told was consistent, this article There is a ruins belonging to the Quaternary Tudor dynasty on the bottom of the street. The entrance is initially determined to be in the abandoned chapel. As for the other entrance, no one knows."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way..." Leonard didn't ask much. After a few words, he returned to the edge and stood against the wall again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and lowered his voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old man, to the field you are good at .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a ruin of the family of the figure. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a slightly old voice in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really The more impolite it is, in our time, disrespect for the high person means that it will be a sacrifice for the living sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, Beckland is unlikely to have a separate family relic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are lying?" Leonard whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly old voice screamed and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, they just don't know enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If my inference is not wrong, the ruins here should belong to the '图铎-Trensolster United Empire'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Leonard was amazed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an ancient dynasty he has never heard of.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The slightly old voice screamed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really a shallow boy, and after the Solomon Empire was destroyed for the first time, it’s exactly what it replaces.铎—Trensolster United Empire”, which ruled the entire northern continent in the form of dual consuls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Double Archon..." Leonard chewed the term. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly old voice is half-smirking and sighing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ruins of the underground There should be an inverted candlestick with a left 41 and a right 40. There are two thrones that seem to belong to the giant. There are...hehe, it may be the place where Arista. Tulu became the 'blood emperor'."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard frowned, and immediately stretched, and smiled easily:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is definitely hidden inside There are a lot of secrets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, but you are not qualified to understand." The slightly old voice snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard did not clearly swear: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exploring the ruins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly old voice screamed twice and no longer spoke. After a minute, Leonard saw the Archbishop of St. Anthony ending the conversation with Archbishop Hola Mick of the Steam Church and returning to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Horamick ordered all members of the "Mechanical Heart" to evacuate and leave it to the night-watchers of the Goddess of the Night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, all the night's ears rang the voice of Archbishop St. Anthony:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red gloves assembled, the rest of the night leaves the mirror world, find reasons to evacuate All the people here, and promised to compensate them for housing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After all the people evacuated, the red gloves and me ruined the ground from the era of evil. Remains! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No access, directly ruin!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May Goddess bless us." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...Leonard did not expect such a development.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 7:30 pm, Governor's House of Olavy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein Changed Tos looks like a black tuxedo, wearing the same color bow tie, and follows Bilt into the dinner hall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside is warm as if the spring, the huge crystal chandelier from the dome Falling down, flashing countless candlelights, the whole venue shines like white.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the right corner, the band members wearing vests and bow ties played a brisk The melody on the left is a long table with grilled chicken, fried foie gras, stewed lamb, Beckland-style roast goose, cream cheese, Olav lobster and more.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if they are far apart, Klein seems to smell the scent they radiate, ready to take a plate and fill the food.<br /><br />&nbsp; & Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Bilt pulled the cuffs slightly and restrained his head and lowered his voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember this banquet Etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our goal now is to watch your manners on the sidelines, so take a glass of wine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "There are foggy champagne, Olmer wine, and Nanwei wine. They are all rare wines outside. You can drink a little, but you can't drink too much. We must keep enough waking. Well, try to drink as much as possible. Just pretend to be like this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took his eyes and nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Bilt each passed by The red vest waiter took a cup with a golden color and a seductive bubble, like a misty champagne, and then moved to the focus of the banquet, wearing the deep blue navy general's Amyrius Levitt.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their status, naturally, you can’t really get close to Admiral, you can only stay a little further and watch each other’s every move.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amyrius is of average size, does not look strong, has a slightly drooping corner, showing his actual age...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He Without a beard, the blue eyes seemed to harbor a majesty that could not be denied....<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His dark blue generals are very straight and have red on the shoulders. The sash, connected to the chest, and a medal...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has a gold-colored cuff Nails, and the same-colored epaulettes reflect each other...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The epaulettes are divided into three parts, from the inside out: the crown of ruby, the crossed scepter and The long sword, four stars dotted with diamonds..." Klein entered a state of great concentration, using the power of "no face" to remember the details of the Admiral and the attitude of the other person and the different people. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, he even took a sip of misty champagne and didn't care what it was.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After the information was collected, Klein gave a sigh of relief and made his head no longer so crazy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of energy that made him feel hungry So, put the wine glass on the tray in the hands of the red vest waiter and prepare to go to the long table to get food.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
