"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the previous Audrey, I will definitely say "Su Shi, your gift is here", so that Jin Mao’s big dog will find her in the room. It is also possible to get real items inside, and it is easy for Su Shi, who has recently studied the basics of mystery, to guess in the direction of ritual magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After changing the rhetoric, things will become Audrey’s mysterious letter/message in the bedroom, confirming that the gift is about to be delivered. Too many possibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi read Audrey’s heartfelt joy and sincere attitude, the subconscious will open his mouth, vibrate the air, make a sound, ask what is Gift, but she was keenly aware that Audrey's personal maid, Anne, came over and warned to give up the original idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She returns to the state of ordinary dogs, slowly wags her tail to express her own pleasure and expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliberately looking for an excuse to go outside and circle, Audrey enters the "Chemistry Laboratory" that is specifically assigned to himself, and will feature and assist the "psychologist" The materials are placed on the long table one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Su Shi, remember the last process of blending potions?" She cleared her throat, straightened her back, and played the teacher with interest. character of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wang, remember!" Su Shi has already understood what her gift is. She was very happy at the moment, and "Wang" made a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey Shunkou said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You try to adjust your own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Shi looked down at his paw and suddenly silenced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey was a glimpse first, and immediately silenced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, before the mouth of the Golden Retriever dog, she nodded unusually and grinned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Su Shi, don't need to speak, I know what you want to say, you want to express yourself as a dog, you can't match the potion, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;好尴尬好尴尬... At the same time, the elegant and dignified Audrey looks at his face in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wang!" Su Shi nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey took the opportunity to turn around and quickly put the "psychologist" potion out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked Su Shi before, knowing that the other party had completely digested the potion this Wednesday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is less than two months in total... Well, there is a large part of the reason that Su Shi is less concerned and can be free in the manor and the villa. Run around, listen to other people's private discussions, "read" the real thoughts of the maids... This is also very good, she will share with me, if not her, I don't know that many people's thoughts have such a dark side But usually it is normal and very kind... Audrey poured the potion into the bowl and put it on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Su Shi’s past and began to groan, and her heart was hard to contain a little expectation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it doesn't matter, 'Psychologist' Miss Audrey is ready, ready to 'settle'! Well, I prefer the name 'psychoanalysis', which is more professional."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey is as beautiful as the emerald eyes, staring seriously at the golden-haired big dog Su Shi, and found that the other's pupils gradually faded, erected, and the thick hair seems to grow dark gold underneath. Scales, and the spirituality of Su Shi is constantly spreading out, as if intertwined with the space of the whole villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healing a little nervous emotion, Audrey focuses on the state of Su Shi, as long as the other side is abnormal, she will immediately use "psychoanalysis" This extraordinary ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Su Shi’s voice rang in her ear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Audrey, I succeeded!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Audrey didn't know what to say for a short while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream, Daisy returned to the Eastern District and returned to the life. Old apartment for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pushed the door open and saw that her mother Liv and her sister, Freya, were working hard on the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When things become happy, they will join them and be responsible for ironing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, she heard a loud knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head and found that the visitor was a young man wearing a black and white police uniform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This police officer is a hairy tourmaline, looks a bit fuzzy, holding a book and a pen, and asks: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "In the case of the card, in addition to what you have already said, what else did you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is not very important. "Yuxi answered quite awkwardly." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handsome police officer looked down at the notebook:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, I am willing to listen." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wuxi looked back at the piece of clothing hanging from the eye and felt that he seemed to have forgotten something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She honestly describes the trivial details, the last words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I was After the kidnapping, my mother and sister had a private investigator to find someone. He was Mr. Sherlock Moriatti. He was a good person. Although he could not find me directly, he contacted the reporter afterwards to help me fight for the foundation. Compensation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired tourmaline police officer looked up again and looked at Daisy, revealing a sly smile:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, I am very satisfied with your answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you remember the private detective? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛西 nodded and was not surprised to see Mr. Sherlock Moriatti appearing beside him.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big detective has a thick beard and glasses of gold, which is no different from what she remembers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;墨发碧After the police officer looked at him a few times, Daisy did not know when he left, and he did not know why the mother and sister in the room suddenly disappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She Running in the Eastern District, looking for a familiar figure, I finally woke up in the deep depression and sadness, looked at the dull ceiling of the school dormitory, and stayed for a few seconds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Daisy did not make a sound, leaned over the body, and buried most of his face in the pillow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The edge of the pillow, the wet marks gradually enlarged.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the Lalhus and Kapin cases, there was a private detective named Sherlock Moriatti, and his friend Mike Joseph... Although they were only on the verge of things, but It’s also the direction of the investigation. Oh, that Sherlock. Moriarty is a bit familiar, which one is wanted?” Leonard recalled what he saw in his dreams, put on red gloves and entered the Church of St. Jude. bottom of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just greeted the team captain Soest and saw a companion approaching and handing over two thin sheets of paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The situation of the red-collar man in the harvest church you are investigating is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, have lunch together? ?” Leonard asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night-timer shrugged his shoulders:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, as long as you don't let I have a nightmare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The deal." Leonard took the paper with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in the same place, did not hurry to sit down and looked up at random:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Emlin White, a vampire, is currently part of the Mother Earth Church... He has been missing for a while, and his parents have commissioned a private detective to look for it, according to a gentleman named Stuart. Eventually solved by the big detective Sherlock Moriatti."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on Leonard's face gradually precipitated and became quite serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock. Moriarty?" He repeated the name in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not in a hurry to find real opportunities to travel The gesture of the person wanders around the port city of Olavé, seeking a short break in a life of tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city is dominated by new Luen immigrants, and the food style is not much different from the East Coast of the Kingdom. The difference is that there are fresh and rare fruits and A variety of seafood is also a bit special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are abundant natural resources and are at the key points of safe waterways. People live fairly well. Even the farmers in the suburbs can make a certain pass through the orchard. Savings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that Olavi is not a poor, there is no bottom, but this class is mainly played by the original slaves - the Lun Parliament has already passed the abolition of slavery . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swallowing the juicy and sweet flesh, Klein looked at the darkened sky, turned the corner, and entered a bar called "Sweet Lemon." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one of Olavia’s most famous adventurer gathering places, and Klein intends to use the two remaining materials of the “Master of Secrets” here – The more common dragon tree bark is matched with the golden spring water of Sonia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the bar is quite lively. There are many people around the boxing ring holding the cups, cheering loudly, and the table around them seems to be an adventure. The family members whispered a variety of rumors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was about to squeeze into the bar and suddenly heard his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I am German Sparrow, you should know who I am, I got a treasure map, I need to hire some helpers, This is not my fear, but I can't lift so many treasures alone..." A 30-year-old green-eyed man with a half-cup of spirits said to two men and two women in the corner who were not businessmen or adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You also called Galman Spalo? Treasure map... How does it sound like a scam... I hunted the "smart speaker" from Baiam to this side? Well, it should be through telegraph and passengers, so many people know my name and deeds, but I don’t know my appearance... Then there are scammers to seize this opportunity, pretending to be a lie... Klein is awkward The ground is close to the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green-eyed man drank a strong drink and took the cup to the tabletop:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
