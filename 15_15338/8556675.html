			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is also very embarrassing "Moon" Emlin, what "redemption rose", what "destination angel", what "destruction cycle", all in him Outside of the scope of knowledge, I can only understand every word, and I don’t know what it means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it seem that the young "sun" has just escaped an angel's pursuit? Emlin made a guess based on the small part of the content that he could understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after the "Sun" Dairik thanked Mr. "The Fool", the "downside down" slightly changed the sitting position and leaned toward each other, from the "Justice" The question started, the tone usually said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the specific way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dairik did not conceal and replied frankly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. 'Justice', 'Mr.", Miss 'Magician', 'Mr. World', Thank you for your concern, and thank you for your comments. In the sixth exploration, I tried..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally described himself Those actions and corresponding results highlighted the details of the little boy Jack from the port of Enmat and the murals of the "Redemption Rose". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enmat Harbor... The strange little boy Jack is really a man of the Kingdom of Lun, that is, the place where the Silver City is located "In some way, it is connected with the North and South continents. If you only need to find a way to find a right place, you may enter... Klein likes to listen to it leisurely, and made a certain judgment in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Port of Enmat is located on the east side of Tingen City and is one of the most famous harbours in the central part of the Kingdom of Rou. It is shared with the Port of Pritz. Supported more than half of Beckland's material supplements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Psychic" Ms. Dai Li once "settle" there, Mr. Z of the Aurora meeting seems to be there too... Klein recalled some things in the past . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same judgment also appeared in the "downside down" Alger, "Justice" Audrey, "Magic" Foss, in this regard, they Some are purely excited, others are curious and worrying, fearing that the darkness that devours everything around the Silver City will continue to spread, eventually covering the north and south continents and the five major oceans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The chief told me that he had thought of the contents of some ancient books that did not know the true and false, through the previous events and the reminders I gave. The creator of all things, the omnipotent God, is watching the land, surrounded by many angels, and the princes of angels, the king closest to the throne, has eight, including the son of God. Rick recalled the words of "The Demon Hunter" Colin, and slowly said, "He suspects that Amon is the 'time angel' in the 'King of the Angels', and the one on the mural is the 'destination angel', 'swallow The tailer 'Ulouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight "King of Angels"? The eight "kings of angels" closest to the Creator of the Creator? "Justice" Audrey was inexplicably excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked with curiosity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Sun, six others What is the title and name of the King of Angels?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Chief did not say, I did not dare to ask..." "The Sun" Dairik responded a bit slyly . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to know the answer... Audrey looked down on the top of the bronze long table and looked at the "fool" in the fog with a eager gaze. Mr., I hope to get the corresponding answer, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has already thought about what she is willing to pay for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See what I do... I don’t know... Klein controls the twitching of the corner of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he is not completely ignorant, he can barely guess who two of the "king of angels" are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evil spirits in the underground ruins describe the Medici family as one of the founders of the 'redemption rose', and from the mural, the angel of destiny 'The great probability of Uluos is one of the leaders of the 'redemption rose', and their status is basically the same. That is to say, the Medici family has a 'king of angels', but it is not certain whether he has fallen...< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the Son of God is the "King of Angels", Amon is one of the 'Time Angels', that Adam is not likely to be, but can't be sure of the title... The other four 'King of the Angels', I can't guess who it is. ...maybe one or a few of them are in the 'Twilight Hermitage'...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is possible! 'The Twilight Hermitage' is hostile to the Fallen Creator, and corresponds to the 'Redemption Rose' that worships this evil spirit. Perhaps it really comes from the original 'King of Angels'...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, there is a side that is not strong enough proof. According to the myths and legends of Silver City, the 'dream dragon' Angelwed, the authority of the ancient god, was taken back by the creator, logically It is not impossible for the master who created everything to divide this power into the "king of angels" next to the throne, and the descriptions and speculations in Russell's diary indicate that the 'Twilight Hermits' may have 'audience', that is The angelic power of the 'dream house' approach is even higher, and the two can form a correspondence...Hermes is the person who has experienced that period of history..." The thought flashed, and Klein smiled slightly:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will come into contact later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I figure it out, I will sell the corresponding information to You... he made up a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the idea that Mr. Fool’s did not answer, “Justice” Audrey slightly lost his gaze and gestured to the small “Sun” to continue to tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inverted Man" Alger has a bold idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cataclysm The history of the past is unrecognizable. At the end of the third season, there were only six true gods in the early Quaternary, plus Amon and the 'swallower'. Isn’t it just eight? They benefit from the death of the Creator. Successfully promoted the sequence 0?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, Alger felt that his thoughts were an embarrassing move that could be sentenced to fire, and an excitement that was difficult to contain. It’s hard to calm down and concentrate on listening to the little “sun” storytelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all this, "Moon" Emlin can only respond with a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the blood family has a long history and a long life, knowing a lot of history before the Cataclysm, but it is concentrated before the ancestors fell asleep, not involving the so-called "angel king". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik tells the details of the collapse of the fate cycle of Silver City's Chief Colin, Klein thinks of another thing:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aboutly, the 'swallower' Uluos is the sequence of the 'monster' route 1 'mercury snake', all the 'king of angels' are corresponding to the sequence 1 person?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will the 'destination angel' be the 'mercury snake' that chased Will. If so, it means that the 'real creator' in Beckland's power is not limited to Mr. A and his men, but the two 'mercury snakes' are all involved in the battle of the sequence 0 position. Energy, innocent, he cares...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, it is not ruled out that Will. Anthony is equal to the possibility of Ulloth, but the probability is not great, 'redemption There are a lot of demigods and even angels, so that the 'swallowers' will not restart without relying on an ordinary person.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still a possibility Beckland's two 'mercury snakes' are not 'destination angels', the latter are still active in the land of God's abandonment, so that the three 'mercury snakes' will be assembled. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After talking about the troubles, "Sun" Dairik once again expressed gratitude, and the experience of repeated cycles, even if it was heard for the second time, still let "Justice" Audrey and others have cold hair, cold hair, and curious and scared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has surpassed my understanding of extraordinary power, thanks to "Mr. Fool" provides help! Audrey proudly praises the owner of the Tarot Club in his heart, and feels that he is full of enthusiasm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thoughts of Alger and others are similar to hers. They think that the experience of repeated cycles is close to miracles. Only the gods can break. Fortunately, the master of the Tarot will be the god, and the "fool" is the god!<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "Sun" Dairik looks to the opposite side, sincerely said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
