			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the remains of seawater and semi-integrated spirits, Klein, with black armor, stands at the door of the central hall, which is a blue-green giant The old priest with a snake and a high belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skin is gray and black, and the latter seems to have been dried for a long time. The latter eyes flashed blue and blue, staring at the "guest" wearing a black crown, as if thinking Where can I come from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no hesitation, no hesitation, Klein leaned into the body with his right hand and took out a brown translucent vial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he stretched his left palm and quickly unscrewed the lid, and at random, threw the "biotoxin bottle" to the corner of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment here, half on the bottom of the sea, in addition to burning the dead spirit and the evil "sacred fire", no flame can exist, it limits Klein" The magician's sequence has two important abilities, so he can only take advantage of the other advantages from the very beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While throwing out the "biotoxin bottle", Klein’s left-hand glove quickly became brilliant and seemed to reflect the sun shining directly at noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s body, the swaying waters were stained with gold, and the layers spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "light priest" ability in "squirming hunger", "purifying the aura"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priest who eats some of the body of the "Poseidon" Cavitewa is certainly not civilized and polite, looking at Klein for pre-war preparations. The blue-green light in the eyes is soaring, and the bulging abdomen has become a lot higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ethereal but stern voice came out of him, instantly Covered the entire ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice is like a nightingale soul singing, both beautiful and pleasing, quiet and chilly, piercing the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stiffened in place, all the thoughts were like encountering extremely cold waves, and instantly solidified in my mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priest’s body swells instantly, like the resurrected Cavitowan or the giant who came out of the myths and legends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his torn robes, he smashed a blue-blue greasy tentacles, and they stalked the silver-white lightning and quickly slid out. Dancing in the air, drawn to Klein who was stuck there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silver and white hair, Klein flew out, and fell heavily at the door, the black body armor of the body was faint, cracked a lot of cracks, the cane in the palm He was thrown into the distance by his unconsciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly calm, almost solidified, he did not use the idea of ​​"paper man substitute", hard hit the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for the “Black Emperor” card and the Aziz copper whistle, it would strengthen his spirit, and with the essence of his sequence 6, this would inevitably be hit hard. Even being spiked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root tentacle rushed over again, flapping down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean, who was "wake up", swiftly rolled over and barely escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the other person’s body shape, immediately turned around, ran out of the gate, ran without hesitation, and ran hard and bold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬! Hey! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein half-flying and half-running, a desperate rush, the old priest’s blue-blue tentacle with silver and white lightning chasing behind him, thinking He was to be pulled back to the hall, but he was always dexterously turned, agile, and rolled in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that it was difficult to do so, the old priest’s abdomen swelled again, and the sound of clear and cold voice resounded again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priest finally moved, taking a heavy but fast pace, trying to catch up with the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so huge that he rushed to the door, and his huge body slammed into the roof and walls that fell down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door here was originally able to pass a super-giant creature like Cavitowan, but the collapse of the previous relics and the "Poseidon" before the death Crazy, the success collapsed here, the door was buried only two meters high and one meter wide, and the old priest, whose mental state was obviously abnormal, hit it directly, and it almost collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who had been waiting for this opportunity, immediately stopped and turned his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He half closed his eyes, straightened his back and opened his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A brilliant beam of light lingering with a golden flame descended from the sky and hit the old priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robes of his robes hanging on the body surface burned directly, the gray skin and flesh fall in blocks, and melted in pure brilliance evaporation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, Klein saw what the eccentric belly had. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of bulging, especially in several areas, forming the overall contour of two eyes and a mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a man hiding in the belly of the old priest, putting his face there and trying to drill it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priest covered the legs of the black snakeskin, and the whole man slammed directly from the collapsed door, hitting the stones and the sea was stirring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally got out of the light column, but most of his body was a wound caused by falling flesh and blood, and even the "face" of the abdomen was full of melting marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬蹬! The old priest, the blue-blue tentacle fluttered, with silver lightning, pumped from all directions to Klein. The "face" of his abdomen was accompanied by a sound that made the spirit "quiet" from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein or rushing, or rolling, or circling, calmly circling with the other side, you left and right, you are before me, just like jumping wild Two-person dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, he relied on "paper man substitute", and he endured the ethereal but cold cry again and again, and sometimes screamed, with resentment The screams spurred the old priest and forced him to interrupt before the "face" of his abdomen made a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time passed by, the crazy old priest had been hanging his hands and suddenly raised, pressed in his abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled his arm and threw it into a mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the blue-colored pus sprayed, and the fine and sharp teeth grew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another screaming, the surrounding seawater poured into the mouth, forming the horror whirlpool that Cavitowa had ever created. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Black Emperor" dressed as Klein was sucked in, and the lightning tentacles around him flew back and hugged him into his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not panic, the glove of the left palm quickly became like pure gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take his eyes in the air and stare at the "face" of the old priest's abdomen and the swirl of the sea below, and the two lightning bolts in the pupil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Interrogator", "spiritual piercing"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priest suddenly froze, the "face" of the abdomen wrinkled together, and the whirlpool of horror suction collapsed instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wave of rewinding, Klein whispered his body, swimming like a fish in the weakness of power, and escaped the blue-green tentacle that was waving wildly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had a drum in his back, and his fists were madly hit, hitting the old priest's thigh near his knee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fists chill out, playing the old priest flesh and blood, hitting the right leg of the other side covered with a thin layer of frost, the surrounding sea water is Thoroughly frozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "live corpse" control of ice power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the screams of the old priest, the root of the tentacle whip was pulled back, and the silvery light illumined the entire relic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Klein did not greedy, stopped in time, tumbling backwards, and escaped the crazy attack of crushing the ground slate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up, and the old priest was still stiff in the opportunity to let the left palm gloves bloom again in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein straightens his body and poses for the praise of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick, clear, sacred pillar of light descended again, engulfing the great old priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein saw the dark flesh of the enemy disintegrating rapidly, and the "face" that saw his abdomen melted, revealing the inside situation - the old priest In the abdomen, the heart, stomach pockets, intestines and other organs are smashed together to form a sea snake's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cavituva has a little spiritual residue... The will of the demigod is really beyond my imagination... Klein has another roll, escaped the rifle The same blue-green tentacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root tentacles wrapped in lightning, melted by the sacred beam of light, inserted into the ground, twitching, twisting, and squirming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net light column quickly dissipated, and the evil face of the old priest’s belly opened his mouth tenaciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the old priest himself bent his waist and gave a violent cough, and the effort of the snake face came to an abrupt end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Biotoxin Bottle" has finally come into play! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not miss this opportunity, stood up again, spread his arms and embraced the "sun." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a beam of light with many golden flames illuminating the area, the figure of the old priest is first, then narrowed, as if evaporating, and the face of his abdomen After a scream of screaming, it was completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the light dissipated, the old priest had regained its original size, the bones were almost melted, and a piece of gray flesh was hung. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His breath is bleak and the spirit disintegrates at high speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein rushed over and relied on his own state of resentment to directly psychic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to confirm whether the old priest is sinful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that he must stick to this bottom line, which is both his own will and prevention of corruption and madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twinkling of an eye, he saw a picture of the scene where the old priest presided over the living sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein no longer hesitates, stretches out his left palm and lets the hungry gloves taste the food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flesh, spirituality, and white bones rushed into the cracked mouth of his palm, and a little blue light was released, accompanied by a little black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the psychic, Klein confirmed that the old priest was a "soul teacher" during his lifetime. The potion formula and extraordinary materials were all from the Fossac Empire. The God of War Church, and when he became the "Poseidon Guard", he was irrational, only knowing to obey orders. After the death of Cavitewa, he followed the instinctive desires and ate the flesh and blood of his god of faith. Conflict, distorted into a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
