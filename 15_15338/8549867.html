			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 7:30 in the evening, Moretti’s table at the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein, why do you need to be a consultant as soon as possible? Is the security of the security company more dangerous?" Banson forked a piece of potato stewed beef. The potatoes in the house, mentioning the morning things implicitly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein carefully spit out the thorns of the sautéed fish, and replied in advance:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A batch of historical documents that need to be immediately transferred to Beckland, I have to check in and confirm that there are no omissions. You know, those who only wave their fists don't know Guvsack."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing his answer, Benson chewed his mouth and couldn’t help but feel a bit:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knowledge is really important "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this opportunity, Klein took out the remaining 5 pound notes and handed them to Benson:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the extra reward I get today, you also need a face-lift dress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"5 pounds?" Benson And Melissa at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the banknote and looked over and over again, half surprised and half confused: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This security company is really generous..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His salary for one week is 1 pound 10 sule, just 6 pounds in 4 weeks, Just one pound more than this extra reward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with such a salary, he feeds his younger siblings and gives them a nice place to eat two or three times a week, which is available every year. A few new clothes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't doubt what I said?" Klein deliberately asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson smiled and said: "I don't think you have that ability, nor the guts, to rob the bank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not a person who can lie." Melissa stopped the knife and fork and answered seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, I am now a person who is used to lying... Klein is a bit shy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is a realistic persecution, my sister’s belief still makes him feel awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today's business is more urgent and important, I played a very important role in it... This is the reason for the value of 5 pounds." Klein Explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a sense, he is telling the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the upcoming £5 funding - the one that was previously prepared to join the divination club, he intends to conceal it, and one takes another 5 pounds to go home. Really scare my brother and sister, let them doubt what they are doing illegal business, and second, they must master the learning and mystery of the "Divination" and accumulate some money to buy additional materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson satisfactorily bite a bite of oatmeal bread and thought for a dozen or more seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My current job doesn't require too decent clothes. Well, to be precise, clothes that are too good for the fabric, this is enough at home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein persuaded him to take the initiative: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With this extra income, we really have savings, I plan to buy a few more accounting Books, for more in-depth study, Klein, Melissa, I don't want to spend another five years, my weekly salary is still below 2 pounds, oh, you know, my boss and my manager, both in my head Filled with stool, a mouth is a stench."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Awesome thoughts." Klein agreed, taking the opportunity to lead, "Why not watch Looking at the grammar books in my room? To be a truly decent person, it is a very important factor to get enough rewards."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benson heard his eyes bright:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did forget this thing, come, let us toast for a better future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not drink rye beer, but poured the oyster broth into three cups and tapped it with his brother and sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking the clear soup, Klein looked at the sister who fought with the fried fish, and smiled low:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to Benson's books, I think Melissa needs a new dress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa lifted her head and kept shaking道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I think it's best..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save it." Ryan added to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Melissa focused on the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, if you don't pursue fabrics and the latest designs, it won't be too expensive, and we will pick up the rest of the money." Klein refused to refuse. The attitude said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson also echoed a sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melissa, do you want to be in Celine? At the 16th birthday dinner of Na, wearing an old dress?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina Wood is a classmate and friend of Melissa, and the family condition is fairly good. Yes, my brother is a solicitor and my father is a senior employee of the Tingen branch of the Beckland Bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, their so-called dinner, that is, ask friends to share dinner, and chat and play cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Melissa lowered her head, muttered and replied, and then forked a piece of beef stew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence for a while, she suddenly remembered one thing and said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mrs. Short had asked the maid to send a business card and hoped to visit us half-officially on Sunday afternoon, at 4 pm tomorrow, to meet new neighbors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Mrs. Shaw?" Klein looked at her brother and sister completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson taps the edge of the table with his fingers, thinking like a thought:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Shaw, 4th Flower Street? I have seen her husband and is a senior lawyer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Senior lawyer...maybe he knows Selena's brother." Melissa said with a little bit of joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are No. 2, Narcissus Street... Klein nodded slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The necessary things, but you know, I still have to go to the security company on Sunday, only to take a break on Monday, sorry for Mrs. Short for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, he remembered the neighbors of his childhood, remembered the neighbors who lived in the Iron Cross Street apartment, and laughed with amazement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Semi-formal visit ...Does the neighbors should not naturally know and naturally come into contact?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, Klein, you don't understand, you have read a lot of newspapers recently. But they have not touched the magazines that are offered to families and to women. They refer to the family between the age of 100 and 1,000 pounds as the middle class, proclaiming that this is the support of the whole kingdom, and praising the arrogance of the middle class without nobles and riches. Not as rude as the low-income class."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson is easy Explain quickly, “These magazines simplify many of the rituals between the nobility associations as a symbol of the middle class. The difference between intimate visits, semi-formal visits and official visits comes from here.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he shook his head and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Morning visit?” Klein and Melissa both asked in a strange way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the morning visit from 2pm to 6pm? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson put down the knife and fork and smiled at the hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know why, I I just read a few magazines brought by my female colleagues, um, maybe because I want to wear a morning dress to visit..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original morning dress is a mass, gathering The dress of the time, later refers to the daytime dress, the difference from the evening dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, you will remember to buy some good coffee powder and tea tomorrow morning, and then buy some muffins and lemon cake from Mrs. Sling, not in front of the neighbors. "I am rude." Klein grinned, smearing the remaining bread with gravy, sandwiching the potatoes, and putting them in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, that is, Sunday morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein finished the last bad tea, put down the newspaper, put on a half-high silk hat, and put a silver cane with silver, slowly slammed the door and took the public The carriage arrived at Zouteland Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Roshan, who had just finished the night, intending to go to the lounge to sleep, greeted him all the way down to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the corner, he met a member of the Night Squad, "The Sleepless" Luo Yao. Lai Ting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very cold-looking lady with long eyebrows, large eyes and dark, silky hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Ms. Laiting." Klein laughed and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Yao looked at him with a dark blue scorpion, and nodded his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two passed by, Luo Yao suddenly stopped and said to the front:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Ritual magic is a very dangerous thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah... Klein stunned, and when he turned his body, he could only see each other. Back view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." He frowned and screamed at the back of Luo Yao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning left, he quickly saw the old Neil in the arsenal, and Bright, who shouldn’t have appeared here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, go to my house, I have already received the corresponding materials, and Bright has promised to help me guard." Old Neil said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein suddenly surprised:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not here?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neil took a silver casket and snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no room for practicing ritual magic." Bryan /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein no longer asked, followed the old Neil back to the ground, then, the two took the public carriage, all the way to the suburbs of the North District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Neal’s home is a single-family house with “materials” such as roses and golden mint in the garden in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering, it was a carpeted porch with two high back chairs and an umbrella stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The porch is a spacious living room with light-colored wallpaper on the wall, the floor is dark brown, with a printed rug in the middle, There is a round table with a heavy texture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The round table is surrounded by comfortable benches, seats, and a piano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My deceased wife likes music very much." Old Neil pointed at the piano and said, "The sofa and the coffee table are in the living room...we are today The ritual magic is in the living room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
