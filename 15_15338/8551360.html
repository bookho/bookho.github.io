			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mr. A? It feels more like the code name of the criminal, not the name of the mysterious strongman... and the "fool" is simply no match... No, it can be compared with the fool, it should be the god or the big man next to the god... Audrey thought of a turn, suddenly full of superiority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She calmly glanced at Mr. A and lowered his voice to Forth and Hugh Dear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to this gentleman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viscount with the hooded robes is also very curious about this. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh Dilcha replied solemnly: "There were several such things, sequence 8, even the extraordinary of sequence 7 was eyeing A. Sir, trying to deal with him, but in the end they all disappeared silently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a powerful extraordinary." Glylint admired the repetition The previous introduction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, four people entered the house, and the goalkeeper immediately closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly adapted to the light of the gas lamp, Audrey saw two blackboards standing at the forefront, with words after the line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Folsch holding a cigarette but not ignited whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "That is the individual needs of the party members. You should understand that many people don't want others to know what they have, so as not to be targeted by greedy people. So, they will write what they want on the blackboard anonymously, or what they want to sell." , and the approximate price and item requirements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey gently daggers, refused to observe the party members, and directly browsed several items on the left side of the blackboard :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Requires the eyes of an adult Manhal fish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dust, 165 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The notes of Russell the Great, three pages, 20 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Audrey can no longer maintain the status of the audience, shocked and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These prices, these prices, too, too cheap! She was excited and happy to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When walking, she looked and saw more items:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Baby Cry , flower, £200."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mummy powder, 10 grams, 5 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fish man's mucus, 30 ml, 29 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 8 'Sheriff'' formula recipe, £450."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too, too cheap! Extraordinary materials are no more than 300 pounds! Audrey looked at her eyes and looked at her companion to find a place to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Hugh Dilcha came to her ear and whispered: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey's breath aggravated, and his mind flashed through the famous statement of Russell's emperor: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has two older brothers, so she won’t be able to inherit her title And the main property, but as a girl who is loved by her parents and brothers, she has a property of 300,000 pounds worth of real estate, fields, pastures, minerals, jewelry, stocks, shares and bonds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is her family property, but before her father Hall Earl passed away, or before she married, she was only nominally owned and received an annual annuity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, as a nobleman, a lot of necessary expenses are indispensable. In particular, she has already taken an annuity income and can no longer find her parents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She controls herself and replies with sternness:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only look at the middle of the moment Sergei’s notes, I am his admirer, I think that the special runes or words he created have mystical power, but we have not found a way to properly combine them.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey, you are becoming more and more hypocritical... She silently added a sentence in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice just fell, a young man in a white shirt and black vest sitting in a nearby chair excitedly echoed:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! That's it! I finally met someone who shares the same opinion with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am The owner of the three-page note, I can sell it to you now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Audrey first stunned, then replied with a smile: "Please Allow me to express my gratitude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She handed out two 10 pounds of cash to each other and harvested three pages of Russell’s diary, of course, No one here knows that this is a diary, only a general name for notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get it, flip it, Audrey confirms that the text is similar to what I have previously obtained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the diary, she whispered to Hugh and Fols: "If the note is fake, who can I look for? Mr. A?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Mr. A does not allow fraud in the party he organized. Well, I can also help you arbitrate privately." Hugh Dilcha eagerly answered . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand." Audrey entered the "audience" state and began to examine the extraordinary and extraordinary reserveers present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the excitement of the young man, many people have noticed this, and they have looked at Audrey and Glylint clearly or invisibly. But they all lack the gaze to penetrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sofa, chair, coffee table are scattered and facing the blackboard together... The material is very general, indicating that the convener Mr. A is not a nobleman, very casual in this respect... ... um, with the confidence he showed, he would not deliberately do similar camouflage... Audrey turned his eyes and calmly observed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mr. A looked at all the ladies and ladies present, and the eyes often stayed on the good looks... he was very good... why did he always look I? Can he see through the cover of the hood? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inferred to this, Audrey was shocked, as disgusting as eating a fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon, she let go of her heart, because she found that Mr. A did not swear to her and other women...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that his eyes can't directly see through the fabric... His vision is very good, just like looking at me at close range. In this case, the role of the hood is very small... Li quietly watched other people's transactions and grasped part of the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Mr. A’s attendant came over and whispered to the four humans:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can write the requirements on paper for me, and you can go to the small room and write the items you wish to sell on the blackboard during the rest period."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Fols sniffed the cigarette, and looked around with a vigilance: "Do you think about the sequence 9 formula you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section In the day, she fulfilled her promise to tell Audrey and the Gregorian Viscounts of all the sequence information that she could understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey pretends to think about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Audience', I want to be' The audience', um, the follow-up to the 'audience', 'readers'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this will cost a lot of money, it is worth it... Audrey quietly praised himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, she found that Hugh Dilcha looked at the blackboard from time to time, and was eager and frustrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hugh told me that the sequence 8 of the 'arbitrator' is the 'Sheriff'... she is looking at the formula worth 450 pounds? She is very eager for the 'Sheriff' formula..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She became an 'arbitrator' for more than a year and has been unconsciously playing 'arbitration' 'The role, should have digested the potion..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the above details, Hugh, lack of money!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey secretly judged, the Priest Glenlint said his choice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Pharmacist' I need the sequence 9' Pharmacist's formula!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After feeling the eyes of Audrey, Fols and Hugh, he explained: "For me, having health, not afraid of most diseases and injuries is the most important thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rational choice, my dream was also a pharmacist "Fol Sigh laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a lazy and decadent temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the decision, Audrey and others will ask for it on the note, hand it to the attendant, then look at him around the circle, ask one by one. Also collected a lot of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendant mixed the note with the companion responsible for the blackboard and asked him to register the information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Requires the formula of the 'audience' and 'reader' potions, the price is negotiated face to face..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever you write one, the waiter will read it three times. If anyone is interested, it will secretly apply for a room and complete the transaction with the help of the waiter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a while, Audrey and Glylint have not been able to wait until someone wants to trade, and they are all somewhat disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, another waiter came over and scraped it to Audrey, giving her a folded note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. A gives you." The waiter pressed his voice down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey unfolded the note and glanced at it, only to read: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Are you interested in other sequence 9 formulas?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey dismissed the corner of his mouth and wrote in the blank space: "I am only right" The audience was 'interested.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She refolded the note and returned it to the waiter, watching the other hand handed over to Mr. A. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mr. opened his glance and said nothing, still watching the party members silently and quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Audrey was keenly aware that the note squirmed and turned into ash and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fifteen minutes, Mr. A said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Entering the rest stage, you can Feel free to communicate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the young man who sold the Russell Diary moved closer to Audrey, excitedly said: "I have cracked a part of Russell the Great The special runes, and they are tattooed on the body, get a good ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you interested?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey suddenly thought that he had asked Mr. Fool and asked him if the special words in Russell’s diary had magical power, and the answer of Mr. Fool’s was that unless there was any god suddenly Interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
