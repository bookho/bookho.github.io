I am responsible for protecting your private detective.” Klein looked at the big boy who hadn't figured out the situation, and smiled low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My family...protect my detective...what happened..." Atru looked around and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he paused, and his pale face was covered with an unspeakable fear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Maybe, maybe there is a ghost in this world! There are ghosts!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is trembling, but Klein hears fear Excited two very different feelings, and this is exactly the same as the color of the emotions presented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excited? Is this a boy who seeks to provoke deliberately provoke resentment? It’s really young and daring to die... Klein made a preliminary guess, but the face confuses and asks: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ghost?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After becoming a "magician", his spiritual vision has improved slightly, but the magnitude is not large, still can not see the surface of the ethereal body in the etheric body, can not judge whether the target is For the extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yatru’s pale face suddenly turned red:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, ghost!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his arm and added:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beside our senses, there are A broader world! Really, death is not the end of everything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This word...it is adolescent...but similar words, I seem Where did I see it... Klein smiled and said: "I believe in another sentence. In the face of an older age than the old, even death itself will disappear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Under the rest of Atru, he took out the gold-shelled pocket watch and looked at it with a look:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, how did you put yourself? What did it look like before? It’s like a patient with a mental breakdown.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I...” Atru thought for a few seconds, “I Joined a community, this is not a general We all believe that death is not the end. You can even intuitively understand death by using a close deed. You can understand that everything can be reversed. Yes, we believe that the dead can be resurrected!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clay, who has been crawling out of the grave for more than a month, laughs two channels:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you trying to resurrect the dead?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death is not the end...the world outside of the senses...everything can be reversed...might perception... Isn't this the doctrine of the spiritual group? It was created for the resurrection of the god of death... He said a few words in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah!" Atru’s eyes brightened but he couldn’t hide his fear and nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did your body get it?" Klein asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We, we will, secretly dig graves, just buried for a long time, or buy from the hospital..." Atru recalled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a crime that will be sent to prison... No wonder Luo Ge. Carman doesn’t want to call the police... It’s so bold to play... Klein keeps A gentle smile, and instead asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet... At that meeting, they looked at my eyes, like, just like watching a dead body, it seems that I want to know where to place the corresponding secrets... Then, we danced and danced to the senses. Outside the world, later, I didn’t remember it...” Yatru’s body trembled uncontrollably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ling dance? It’s a spiritual sect... This guy has become a companion’s guinea pig? Klein asked with a slight frown: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After that, your memory is up to now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the internal data of the night, the "spiritual dance" comes from the ancient ritual dance, popular in the South China, is a ritual method that the god of death loves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ling Dance" uses rhythm, rhythm, and movement to reconcile spirituality, making it interact with the natural environment and the object of praying, combined with simple The altar arrangement and the corresponding name give the effect of more complex ritual magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Yatlow responded with a low voice and suddenly looked up. "What day is it today? What time is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1:12 am on Friday." Klein replied with his memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yatru subconsciously took a breath:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I missed a new party... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will hold a resurrection ceremony outside the Green Grave at 3 am every Friday."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Graveyard is named for being not far from Green Park Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still want to go? Have you forgotten this time? Hey, you really don't remember, but you should ask your father, mother and Servant.” Klein reminded the boy in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I may not be able to help you... He silently added in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this time, he discovered a shortcoming of the magician, that is, the ability to deal with the creatures of the ghosts, only the manipulation of the flame can Counting, after the other person possesses human beings, it is a problem to expel and purify, unless it is intended to kill people with ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Klein is not completely incompetent in this regard, he can arrange ritual magic to accomplish similar things, but it will be very troublesome, it is easy to expose itself Not suitable for actual combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After thinking, he finally chose to use the Azick copper whistle to lure the blame, then manipulate the flame to complete the purification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the degree of such damage is not high, and if you encounter a powerful grievance, you may not be able to solve it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still lack items or spells to deal with necromantic creatures. If there is a seal "3—0782", the "variant sun emblem" is fine. ... Klein’s thoughts have briefly diverged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yatru remembered the lack of memory, his face pale again, trembled and replied:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No, I don't want to go! I don't want to go anymore!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Klein smiled and praised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yatru looked at his face without fear, and subconsciously asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said so much, are you not afraid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein no longer relies on the wall, slowly stands up straight, and replies with ease: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For a detective, unless you have definite evidence, would rather not believe it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After that, he opened the door and went outside, thinking about whether or not to contact the spiritual group. After all, this may involve the mystery of Mr. Azick’s life experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yatru looked at the back of the private detective in a dull manner, only to find out that the bathroom was empty except for himself, and the moonlight was dark outside. In the shadows, if there are intangible things lurking, watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yaru stepped up and rushed out of the bathroom, followed closely behind Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After knowing, knowing fear, and saving... Klein groaned and put his hands in his trouser pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the bedroom, Stuart did not find that Yatru had improved, still being scared by his own ghost story, not afraid to go . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Artra fell asleep again, Klein took out a copper penny and let it spin between the fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the time was near 2:50, he threw the coin and held it steady, then stood up and whispered to Stuart: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went to the balcony to smoke cigarettes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry up." Stuart Something screamed tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein put on his long dress and walked slowly to the balcony at the end of the corridor, hiding in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he pulled out a paper man who was relatively rough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shook his wrist, shaking the paper to make a crisp sound, shaking it quickly and inflating it into a human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dummies and Klein are generally high and low, the five senses are exactly the same, the dress is no different, far away, like a sculpted wax figure . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the applications of the "paper man substitute" technique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, Klein gathered his spirits, clenched his fist in his right hand, and tapped on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sound, the dummy has a feeling of being alive, and a cigarette with a red head is licking on his mouth, and the smell of tobacco is filled out. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the dummy as the basis, this illusion can last for half an hour... It’s a magician!" Klein put on his gloves, one by one, concealedly Sliding down the balcony, avoiding the security guards who patrolled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the Green Cemetery, in a secluded woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stood in the canopy, looking out at a relatively flat and flat place not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is surrounded by evergreen leaves and brown branches, but their surfaces are stained with gray dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s sights, seven or eight teenagers and men in black robes are jumping around a corpse, a little twitching, a bit mad dance . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dance is full of rhythm and seems to have some mysterious taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl swayed long hair, the boy slammed his hand, and this scene had a subtle connection with the surrounding environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the natural rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they jumped for three or four minutes, everything in the area around ten meters was dyed with wild and confusing temperament, and the atmosphere gradually became sinister and mixed. A little bit sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a “spiritual dance”... even ritual magic that ordinary people can participate in... Klein moves away from the line of sight and looks to the side of the body to bury his head and mourn The man in the black robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he is guiding the boys and girls how to dance “spiritual dance”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be a member of the spiritual group, presumably the extraordinary... Klein is not visible in the dagger, and plans to watch the other side how to hold the resurrection ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
