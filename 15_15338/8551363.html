			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, this is the question I want you to ask! Klein nodded seriously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel better, I even think that I can pass the examination of the church now, this is a language that cannot be described. Experience and self-confidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the answer just may be a little vague, he couldn’t help but add another sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the name of the potion is really the key. When I go to a diviner in strict accordance with the 'divination code' I have summed up, everything is beautiful and easy. Well, I have been able to Use a more subtle way to open the mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den's brow wrinkled, twilight admittance, as if thinking in self-talking: "magic The name of the drug..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a dozen seconds, he revisited Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Do you need to go back and tell your family? On Sunday, the day after you are on the door of Chanis, you should have a rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that Elizabeth is a good friend of her sister, and she promised that the problem would be solved within a week, Klein replied in no difficulty: "You don't need to waste time. After the departure, let the carriage wrap around the daffodil street." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, you go to Frye, I fill out the application form and get the seal '3—0782'." Dunn pointed to the diagonally opposite Lounge road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frye is a "collector", without the energy of "sleepers", if you have time, you will often take a nap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fill in the application form yourself, sign it yourself, collect it yourself... Captain, we have a loophole in this management system... Klein has two words in his stomach, no opening, take Put on the hat, exit Dunn's office, and ring the door opposite the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After repeating the voice three times, Freila opened the door and looked at Klein in a puzzled way:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he was still taking a nap, his hair was a little messy, his shirt was not dressed neatly, it was cold The gloomy temperament was diluted a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, however, it’s like a dead man who just climbed out of the coffin... Klein hid his smile and answered very seriously:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a case involving a resentment, and the captain wants your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Frye subconscious Raise your hand, smooth the messy hair, and turn it into a cold person who is not close to the living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was finished, the two felt in the sofa area of ​​the reception hall for seven or eight minutes and felt warm and pure, as if they were receiving the sun light. Irradiation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they saw Dunn Smith coming out of the partition with a half-slap-sized quaint coat of arms in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This badge is in dark gold, with the symbol of the sun engraved on it, with a section and a line extending to the edge, from Inti The seal of the Republic of the Republic "3 - 0782", formerly known as "the variation of the sun's holy emblem." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Intis is the country that was transformed from Russell from the Empire into a republic and from the Republic to the Empire. Now it has established a solid The Republican system is located on the west bank of the Northern Continental, bordering the Lun Kingdom with markers such as the Inter-Sea and the Hornachs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because since the founding of the country, the eternal pilgrimage church has occupied the mainstream, and has been suppressing the goddess of the craftsmanship to the other name to rename the church of steam and machinery, so This country is also known as the country of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go, Frye is responsible for driving, and Cesare can't take on the purification of the holy emblem for so long." Dunn calmly told. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cesare Francis is a civilian who is responsible for purchasing and claiming supplies, and also a part-time coachman, but he is an ordinary person and can’t be in the seal. 3—0782” Waiting for more than an hour in the fifteen-meter range, and from Zoeteran Street to Ramd Town, according to Klein, it takes at least two and a half hours, which does not include a trip around Daffodil Street. time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the afterglow of the sun dyed the spires of the town church golden, the night squad carriage from the daffodil street finally arrived. Ramde. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This town is located in the northwest of Tingen. Many buildings still have the characteristics of the pre-steam era. There are almost no factories. It is a business point in all the surrounding villages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the carriage was parked at the corresponding location of the town hotel, Dunn swept the opposite barbershop:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have just asked the local residents. It takes only one quarter of an hour to go to the abandoned castle on the mountain. It is said that it belonged to the lord who ruled here at the end of the Quaternary, but later did not know what happened, changed It has become what it is now, of course, their descriptions can only be attributed to folklore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, we are now, solve the problem before dark Resentment, then take turns guarding '3—0782' and keep it away from ordinary people?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Dunn’s “Various Sun Emblem” to the present, It has been three hours, and the limits of the extraordinary are getting closer and closer. In the long run, they must be separated and give each other time to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Frye answered briefly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have no problem." Klein quietly touched the "Silence Charm" and "Soul of the Soul" in his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three night-wearers wearing black tuxedos and hats or felt hats crossed the town streets and walked from the winding road to the nearby hill. The grass is thick and the bushes are densely covered, but the road is quite wide and can be used for almost two carriages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, they saw an old castle with a collapsed outer wall, and saw the still-grown outer wall covered with green plants, and the exposed places were more There are mottled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from there, Klein felt the bitter cold, and his arm hoared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a resentment." Frye looked at the castle, and said nothing in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den looked sideways at a new night-watcher and smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, there is '3 - 0782', there is Fry, the soul will not cause too much trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds a special revolver in one hand and holds it in one hand The mutated sun emblem, which took the lead, went to the ruined castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is behind, always ready to pull the trigger, or take out the cane and use the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dunn is less than five meters away from the old castle, when the incomplete horses and water wells are reflected in Klein’s eyes, a cold and cold can be described with sorrow The wind has blown out and seems to be rejecting the arrival of uninvited guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three value nights did not stop, continue to move forward, the feeling of warmth and purity gradually dissipated the cold, occupying the front end of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stepped on the stacked stones and walked through the collapsed façade, slowly entering the castle that lost the gate, stepping on the broken floor tiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone pillar collapsed, the mossy castle hall was quite wide, but the window was narrow and located at a higher position, making lighting a difficult thing, let here Dull and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the characteristic of ancient architecture at the end of the Quaternary and the early Quaternary...Pseudo-historian Klein instinctively judged and concealed the vision . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the illusory but harsh anger broke out, and the thick black mist did not know where it suddenly spread, against the erosion of warmth and purity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a tall figure in the dark fog. He wore black full-body armor and carried a broad sword that normal people could not wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You disturbed my sleep! You must use blood and meat to pay back!" He stepped forward, and he approached Dunn, and the broad sword in his hand slashed heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng was quick to step back and the pong raised his hand and fired a shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver hunter bullet did not penetrate the illusory black armor, hitting it, making a crisp but not real sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and Frye retreat to the side at the same time, a single hand holding a gun, aiming at the two positions of the black armor’s eye position, triggering the trigger, one eye Turning to a deep, quiet gray, focus on the grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black knight once again roared, striding to follow Dunn and swept the broadsword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad sword failed to hurt Dunn, but he flicked him out and slammed into the door and vomited blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sound, "3 - 0782" fell to the ground, the right foot of the grievance wearing the iron boots could not wait to kick the past, this piece is constantly purifying the surrounding The dangerous badge of things kicked out the gate of the castle and kicked out its fifteen-meter range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, who hadn’t hit the shot just now, saw this scene, worried and nervous, and feeling strange, just like being in a kind of A look down, calm, and rational attitude examines the changes in front of us. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fired another shot, and the silver hunting demon bullet hit the face of the resentment and hit Mars, but it did not cause obvious damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right hand glove!" Just then, Frye, who had always been cold and gloomy, shouted, his voice full of anxiety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, he also lifted the revolver and aimed at the iron gloves on the right side of the resentment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! Pong! Klein, who almost did not subconsciously follow Fry's words, pulled the trigger and shot the silver hunting demon bullets at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the resentment did not use the armor to block, but was prepared to erect a broad sword and easily fly the two bullets out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! He took a step and rushed to Klein at the speed of the charge, directly hitting him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein flew out and saw himself sagged in the chest and saw that he was vomiting blood, but there was no feeling of being uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He woke up and fell to the ground, rolling and screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the castle, the resentment, the collapsed pillars, the moss everywhere disappeared, everything returned to the black mist, the black armor just emerged when. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference is that Dunn clenched his fists and half-bowed his body, and the gray eyes became dark and deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, everything before is a dream, the captain will pull the soul, me and Frye into his dream at the same time, but I am more special, can stay awake And reason... Klein found himself still standing in the position of two meters from the right hand of Dunn, did not vomit blood, and did not scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Dunn straightened his body and looked at the grievances that were about to be slashed, and calmly said:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than a minute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a scream of grievances, followed by a scream of screams, and the body began to sizzle black fog , like receiving a death announcement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the level of evil spirits and ghosts can't exist in the fifteen-meter range of the "variant sun's emblem" for more than a minute! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, captain, you are so handsome! Klein looked at the scene and almost shouted 666. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
