			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein whispered, taking off the low hat and putting it on his head again, thinking more about the seal. The appearance of "0-08". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks like a normal feather pen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing does not require ink? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is its real role? So that it is highly confidential and considered "very dangerous"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not going to write the cause and effect of who died? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, that’s too bad, Inns Zangweier doesn’t have to sneak away...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Klein just turned and wanted to leave, behind Dunn Smith suddenly shouted at him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, I forgot something "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Klein turned his head back, full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng puts his pocket watch and smiles:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You remember to look for accountant Ollie Mrs. Anna, prepaid for four weeks, a total of 12 pounds, and then only receive half of the salary every week until the repayment is completed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too much, no need for this , can be a little less." Klein said subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the advance payment, he did not object, after all, there was no public carriage fee for the return, but he could get a huge amount of 12 pounds, but some people would be afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is a must." Dunn shook his head and said, "Do you think, are you willing to continue to live in the apartment? Even the bathroom To be shared with several households, regardless of themselves, you must also consider the ladies, and..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Klein’s dagger’s approval, he paused and smiled at each other. The clothes are a few, meaning deep: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you also need a cane, and you have to buy a dress."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a second and immediately woke up, his face suddenly had a fever, because the set he wore was cheap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, the top hat is made of silk, worth 5 to 6 sule, bow tie 3 sule, silver cane 7 to 8 sule, Shirt 3 Sule, pants, vest and swallowtail are about 7 pounds, leather boots 9 to 10 sul, this set down, a total of 8 pounds and 7 sules, of course, a decent gentleman also needs a bracelet, pocket watch And wallets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the original owner and brother Benson province to eat, used a sum of money, went to the lock store to ask, the result is not even dare to pay I slid away and bought a set of people in a cheap shop near Iron Cross Street, which was less than two pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, the original owner’s impression of the price of clothing is extremely impressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good, okay." Klein replied in a stuttering stance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the same person as the original owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den took out his pocket watch again and looked at it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or you first Going to Mrs. Oliana? I don't know how long you will stay in Old Neil. Wait a little longer, Mrs. Oliana will go home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Okay." Klein was deeply sleepy and did not object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun walked back to the table and pulled one of the ropes under the draping:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I let Rosanne take you there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ropes are running, the gears are turning, and Rosanne in the reception hall of "Black Thorns Security Company" hears the bells hanging next to them. Loud, quickly stood up and carefully went downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunn Smith humorously laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't disturb your rest? Well, bring Moretti to Mrs. Oliana."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roshan quietly pouted, "happy" answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, captain."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just like this?" At this time, Klein was surprised to blurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to "finance" advance salary, do not need the captain to approve the sliver, write a beggar? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So?" Dunn questioned and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I mean, go to Mrs. Oliana for a salary advance, don't you need to sign it?" Klein used as simple as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, no, no, Rosanne can prove." Dunn Smith pointed to the brown-haired girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain, we have almost no management of "financial management"... Kline resisted the urge to vomit, followed Roshan and walked out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he once again heard Dunn shouting:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a minute There is still something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you finish your speech at once? Klein turned back with a smile: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You speak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dune pressed Lower Temple Road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you go to the old Neil, remember to receive ten 'hunting bullets'."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I? Hunting the bullets?" Klein was surprised to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well's that revolver is not with you? You don't have to turn it in." Dunn stalked in one hand, "cooperating with the hunter Bullet', you really have a wonderful danger, you can protect yourself, hey, this can at least give you courage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not add the last half sentence ... Klein is answering this question without hesitation: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, I will remember!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This requires me to write a formal document, you wait." Dunn Smith sat down, picked up the dark red water-absorbing pen, and brushed it. "Strip", signed a name, stamped a chapter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Captain." Klein sincerely took it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly stepped back and turned again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dunn shouted again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Captain, you seem to be in your thirties, how can you have a precursor to the future? Klein squeezed his smile and asked back: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I just forgot, you haven’t practiced shooting, and it’s useless to hold the 'Hunting Bullet'. In this way, you will receive 30 normal bullets every day, and you will go out to the streets, No. 3 Zoetlan Street. The underground shooting range practice, most of which belong to the police department, but there is a venue dedicated to our night owl, ah, yes, you need to get a badge from the old Neil, or you can't enter the shooting range." After taking the forehead, I took the "strip" from Klein's hand, brushed up the other content, and added a chapter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good gunners are all fed with bullets, don't underestimate them." Dunn handed the modified "paper strip" to Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Klein, who is afraid of danger, can’t wait to go today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, is there anything else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing." Dunn must nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein breathed a sigh of relief and walked outside the door. He couldn’t wait to turn around again and ask, “Is it really gone?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He resisted this impulse and finally "smoothly" left the "keeping room." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The captain has always been like this, often forgetting things." Roshan walked aside and whispered, "My grandmother is better than him, of course, he only Will forget the little things, um, little things, Klein, I will call you Klein later, Mrs. Oliana is a kind person, very good, her father is a watchmaker, the craft is very good..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the brown-haired girl's sneak peek, Klein stepped on the stairs and returned to the upper level, seeing Mrs. Oliana in the office on the right hand side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a black-haired lady in a ruffled dress. She looks like she is in her thirties, with stylish curly hair and a pair of green pupils. Elegant and elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olianna listened to the arrangement of Dunn Smith after listening to the arrangement of Dunn Smith, and took out the note and wrote a pre-send:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You signed the word. Is there a seal? If you don't have a handprint."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Klein is familiar with The procedure was completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oriana took out the bronze key, opened the safe in the room, counted the golden pound, and smiled and said:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are so lucky, there is enough cash today, yes, Klein, are you involved in the evil event, and you have the special strength before being invited by the captain?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, madam, your instincts are accurate." Klein did not praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olianna took out four light gray-colored, dark-black-colored banknotes, re-locked the safe, and turned around while laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I am the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Klein appropriately expressed surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know that the serial killer of the entire city of Tingen was sensational 16 years ago?" Oliana handed four gold pounds to Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Remember! Even killing five girls, some taking the heart, some taking the bloody butcher's stomach? When I was young, I was Mother often used this thing to scare my sister." Klein thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the banknote and found that it was two 5 pounds and two pounds, both of which were gray and black, with complex patterns and special watermarks on the corners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is slightly larger, the central is the fifth king of the Kingdom of Lun, the immediate ancestor of George III, Henry Augustus I, with a white hair set The face is round, the eyes are long and narrow, and the expression is very serious. In the eyes of Klein, there is an incomprehensible closeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a 5 pound note! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equal to the salary of Banson for nearly four weeks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the 1 pound note is the father of George III, the former king William Augustus VI, the "strong" has a thick beard and perseverance The eyes, during his reign, the kingdom of Luen got rid of the old bondage and once again reached the top of the countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a "good king"... Klein vaguely smells the heart-warming ink of the banknotes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, if it’s not the night rushers, I’m the sixth victim.” Mrs. Oliana’s tone still hides a trace of fear. Even if this matter has passed for more than a decade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds like the serial killer, no, butcher, is it an extraordinary person?" Klein carefully folded the notes, placed them in the pockets on the inside and then continued nearby. I touched it a few times to confirm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No wonder there are different internal organs... Sorry, madam, let you remember the bad things," Klein said sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olianna chuckled: "I haven't been afraid... I was at the business school to read the accountant, then I came here, OK. Don't delay you, you have to go to the old Neil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goodbye, madam." Klein took off his hat, left the office, and stepped down the stairs. Before, I couldn't help but touch the inside pocket and confirmed that the 12-pound banknote was still there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned at the crossroads and headed to the right side, not long after seeing a half-covered iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚,咚,咚. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the knock on the door, there is an old voice inside:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pushed the iron door and found it to be a narrow room with only one table and two chairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the room, there is a tightly locked iron door, and behind the table, an old man with a white hair wearing a classical black robe is just around the table. The light of the gas lamp reads a few yellow pages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and looked at the door:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Klein Moretti Just now, Rosanne said that you are very polite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Rosanne is really a friendly person, good afternoon, Mr. Neil." Klein took off his hat. Greetings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit down." Neil pointed to the inlaid silver tin can on the table. "Would you like a cup of coffee?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrinkles in his eyes and mouth are very deep, and a pair of dark red scorpions are slightly turbid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't seem to drink?" Kline was keenly aware that Neil's ceramic cup was clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, this is my habit, don't drink coffee after 3 pm." Neil smiled and explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Klein asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neil smiles at Klein’s eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am afraid that sleep is bad at night Then, I will hear some inexplicable whispers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Klein didn’t know what to say, and instead asked:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Neil, what documents and books should I read?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he would be Dunn Smith The "strip" written was taken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"History-related, complex, piecemeal, to be honest, I have been trying to learn, but I can only master the initial, the other is too much trouble, what? People's diaries, popular books, epitaphs, etc., etc.," Neil complained. "For example, I need more detailed historical records to infer specific content."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Klein heard a bit confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neil pointed to a few yellow pages in front of him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Rose The diary lost by Gustav before his death, he kept it with the strange symbols he invented for confidentiality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell? Passerby predecessors? Klein groaned and immediately listened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because many people believe that he has not really died, but has become a hidden god, so there have been cults who worship him to hold various rituals, trying to get Power, we occasionally encounter such things, get a few original or copybook notes." Neil shook his head and said, "Today, no one can interpret the true symbol of those special symbols, so 'Holy Church' Allow us to keep a copy of the research and hope that there will be unexpected surprises."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
