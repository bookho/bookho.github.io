			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange, distorted, vague volatility flashed away, and Klein almost doubted that he had an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If his mastery of inspiration is already proficient, it is highly likely that this anomaly will be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the sister upstairs, Klein frowned, clenched his cane, bypassed the bathroom, and turned to the ladder of Wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hurried up, according to the inspiration of the residual traces, came to the living room door near the balcony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be here... Klein whispers, raising his hand and tapping his eyebrows twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One "air field" occupies his eyes through walls and wooden gates, most of which are normal in color and blurred in outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one of them, the surface is swaying with the evil black green, slowly darkening the black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a problem." Klein's expression became very serious, stretching his right hand to solve the silver chain wrapped around his left wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His left hand holds the silver chain so that the citrine pendant hangs naturally in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the swing subsides, he outlines the ball of light and meditates in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My body There is a danger in the former room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Normally, the "spiritual spelling" is only suitable for divination and its own, and within a small range The objective situation, therefore, Klein's description is quite stressful: "Danger" will cause itself to be affected, and "room" is in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a danger in the room in front of me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and over again, after seven full trips, Klein blinked and saw the citrine pendant in a clockwise rotation, and the speed was quite fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This indicates that there is indeed an extraordinary danger in the room, and the degree of danger is not low! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina is a sinister lover, she took a friend to play a ceremony to play a big problem? How to do this? Klein rubbed his brow and re-wrapped the citrine pendant, reaching out and ringing the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked three times in a rhythm, with a kind smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the door opened, and Melissa, wearing a new dress, appeared in front of Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein, is there anything?" The girl didn't expect her brother to come over, and was quite surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein replied with a sullen smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard you playing very well Happy, a little curious at the moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I’m having a fight." Melissa bowed her head and apologized. "We are playing magic mirror divination, match." Linna knows a lot and is very fun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic divination...Sister, why don’t you play the pen fairy? Klein shook his head in a good and funny way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes crossed Melissa, looking into the living room, and saw Selena, who had a smile and a deep dimple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in his spirit, the burgundy long-haired girl with a silver-plated mirror was more eroded by the evil black and green. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts are sharp, Klein considers the language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I will not bother Your game, ah, Elizabeth? I just talked to her about the grammar of Guvsak, and she said that I have questions to ask me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Elizabeth?" Melissa looked up and down at home with her brother. The tone was eccentric and emphasized, "She is only sixteen years old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, what do you want? Klein immediately explained: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a normal academic discussion, Elizabeth is very interested in history and ancient languages."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa took a deep look at her brother and then said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is inside, I let her out." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Klein stepped back and left the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his sister turned around, he was not too kind and relieved, not for Melissa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just waited for a dozen seconds, and a confused Elizabeth walked out and wondered:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Moretti, what exactly do you have? I have not said that I am interested in history and ancient languages..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is here At the time, her words were interrupted by Kline's serious and solemn expression. The whole person was very tight and seemed to smell something bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein walked a few steps, indicating that Elizabeth had come halfway behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl with a cute baby fat on her cheek was affected by the dignified atmosphere that suddenly came, and she did not consciously follow it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know, I am a occult enthusiast." Klein stopped and turned to the body and said straightforwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth gently daggers response:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I even think you are a occult expert ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am just a fan, but this does not prevent me from discovering that your mirror has a problem with divination." Klein said solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a problem?" Elizabeth almost pulled up the volume and was busy reaching for her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought for a moment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that simple words are hard to convince you You are now returning to the living room, and Selena is not paying attention, and peeks at the front of the mirror that she will never show you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know her? Don't show us the front of the mirror?" Elizabeth blurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the internal data of our night-timers, more than 90% of the "magic mirror divination" cases involving evil will have a similar situation... Ryan smiled slightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Common sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for doubt and fear, Elizabeth re-entered The room, his calm and calm smile disappeared, his face was full of worries:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in the North District, but from Fania Street to Zouteland Street At least 15 minutes of public carriages, one after another, waiting for the captains to come over, things may have deteriorated to be unable to clean up... If Benson and Melissa are not here, but I can’t deal with those secrets. There is no way to stop it... Is there any way to temporarily curb it... Yes, Selena is a occultist, and her room should not lack items such as pure dew, essential oils and herbs...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein tried to think about countermeasures, Elizabeth randomly found a Excuse to discuss the matter, he sat down next to Selena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When can I meet a romantic, handsome gentleman when I am divining?" A girl from the opposite side drank a wine and was ridiculous. In the sight, blushing, said with courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina coughed twice, rubbing the back of the mirror in a serious way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mirror mirror tells me, when will the gentleman in the eyes of Unina appear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three times, she picked up the mirror and leaned in In front of yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grab this opportunity, Elizabeth jerked sideways and looked at the probe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As expected, she felt that she would see Selena's face in the mirror and see her half face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, only Selena was caught in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only Selina in the small mirror, and Selena is still in the whole body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a darkness in the mirror, and the center is standing with a cold expression of Selena! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth trembled, hurried back, leaning against the back of the sofa, and forgot the breath for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t resist the trepidation, refused to make excuses, slammed up, ran to the door, and dared not look back at the smiling smile. Selena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gentleman of Elena will appear on the second week of the week after half a year..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the voice of laughter, Elizabeth opened the door and saw Klein in a tuxedo and a half-high silk hat standing in the shadow of the wall lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Moretti, me, I..." She stuttered and couldn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein calmly laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not disturb the ladies and ladies inside." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infected by his smile, Elizabeth calmed a little, stretched out the door and walked quickly to the wall lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I saw it, I saw Selena in the mirror, the devil-like Selena..." she said in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough... Klein drank a little more, and asked in a deep voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Do you know where Selena’s bedroom is? Do you know where her occult items are?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Where, mystery items are there too "Elizabeth did not hesitate to point to the diagonally opposite room." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took a cane, walked over, unscrewed the wooden door without anti-locking, opened the valve with the light of the streetlight outside the window and the bright red moonlight, lit up Gas lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint glow shone, he swept over, saw a bottle of pure dew, flower essence, saw a box of herbal powder, and a root Candles, one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These items are either placed on a desk or neatly arranged in a shelf, labeled with a label giving the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirmation, Klein said to Elizabeth behind him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to save the game Lina?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Think!” Elizabeth nodded and asked again, “Dangerous?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a certain danger, after all, I am just a occult lover." Klein calmly replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A certain danger..." Elizabeth clenched her lips for a few seconds. "What do I need to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiles gently to appease:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to be nervous, you only need to pretend that everything has not happened to return to the living room, back Next to Selena, after five minutes, remember, after five minutes, you used the excuse of giving Selena a surprise, take her here, tap the door, one long and two short, then, um, then Give it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth recalled it silently and solemnly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her returning to the living room, Klein looked at the pocket watch, closed the door of the Selina bedroom, and quickly cleared the desk with her hands and feet. Come out and pick the items you need to pick them up on the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he picked up two lightly scented candles, placed in the upper left and upper right corners of the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
