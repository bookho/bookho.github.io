			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before leaving the house, Klein threw a coin and asked if it was not good for the "Brave Bar" today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting a negative answer, he looked around and whispered into the air:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Is anyone monitoring me today?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds of silence, the illusion of the bodyguard’s illusion suddenly came from behind his back:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked back and couldn’t find the bodyguard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His attention quickly shifted to the answer, and he couldn’t help but sigh in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The military situation is not here, I did not put me in the suspect list! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that Rosago had never looked for me, he completely left me aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel so honoured, or do you think you have been insulted? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, a detective who is busy looking for cats and traitors can’t be associated with assassination of a country’s ambassador, killing the top 5 and other things...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the military situation has more or less monitored me for a while, my panic, my helplessness, my hard-working self-help, they are seen in their eyes Obviously, the ambassador could not cause substantial harm...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thoughts were mixed, Klein wore a half-height silk hat, put on a black silver cane, and walked out At 15 Minsk Street, spend 2 Sule, and take the rental carriage to the "Brave Bar" on the Iron Gate Street in the Beckland Bridge area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is familiar with it, passing through the crowds who are cheering around the boxing ring, come to the bar and knock down the table:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A cup of Southwell beer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender looked up at him and shouted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caspars is in the 3rd card room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein smiles and poses 5 1p Copper coins were pushed to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he put on a wooden cup and drank the foamy white and delicate Nanweier beer, bypassing the two most competing and lively and most sweaty , knocked on the door of the No. 3 card room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspars is playing a limited number of Texas with a group of people, the banknotes in front of them are stacked high, and the yellow coins are so dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noting Klein’s gaze, the black-skinned weapon businessman with a huge scar on his face twitched the big nose of Red Pass, and said casually:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like to use chips, which makes me feel unreal, or the texture of the banknotes and the weight of the coins are intoxicating, just as cool as a woman!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After muttering this sentence, Casper slightly frowned:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not answer directly, and he said to the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! I want to empty them! Shit, I don't follow!" Casper threw the two cards in front of him. Then he limped to the door and said to Klein, "You'd better have enough reasons!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the card room, come to the corner, Klein slammed the voice: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to know when the recent party was the same as the last one."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspars scrupulously examined him: "Is Maricchi not talking to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaspas hesitated and said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a party tonight, the organizer is still the last one, but you have to wait for more than half an hour, I told them in the past that you showed your credibility last time, I don’t think it’s a big problem.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No problem, I will pay you for it.” Klein I touched the banknotes in my pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time only costs 1 pound." Kaspas is a very generous look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's worth it." Klein's mouth on both sides of the mouth is also upturned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After paying the reward, he found a position to sit down and drink the fragrant Nanweier beer while enjoying the contest on the boxing ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can bother both of them at the same time..." Klein quickly reached such a conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, Casper returned to the bar and looked around, pressing down the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"There was promised over there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are half an hour later, the storm is on, I hope you have not forgotten that mask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Klein made a positive response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowed down the speed of drinking, snoring in a small mouth, and spent half an hour to finish the 500 ml large cup of Nanwell beer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is the last road, still the house without lights, Klein wears an iron mask that only covers the upper half of the face, watching Casper rang the door in a rhythmical manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the last time, the knocking on the door has been changing... Klein listened carefully for a while and saw the small planks on the door open and looked at the eyes. come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a process that didn’t differ, he put on his hooded robes and hid the entire face in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still the living room, or a dimly lit candle, Klein casually found a position and sat quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unlike before, he is no longer depressed, no longer tight, and instead looks around leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The cold wind blowing behind his neck made him sure that the bodyguard had followed him, not being noticed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the party here did not have the strongest of the sequence 5, and maybe even the sequence 6 did not... Klein thought thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening for a while, he saw that the sleek "pharmacist" changed his sitting position and seemed to want to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the pharmacist who showed half of his chubby face quickly lifted his hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' The snake seems to have died in the sewer..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The beasts are still plundering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Black Snake" is dead? When he heard the news, Klein was quite upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Snake" is the man who sold him the "listener" and made him "successful" to make the "dirty language", suspected of aurora a member of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not low in strength, but he died in a simple clean-up of the sewer beast mission... Klein wondered and frowned, suddenly remembered one thing:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is when he found Zerel’s body and heard the movements in the depths of the sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he led Ian in the past, Zerrell’s body had been smashed by strange beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s at the bottom of the Iron Street in the Eastern District, and it’s quite far from the Beckland Bridge area. I don’t know if it’s related... Klein didn’t verify it at all. The impulse of this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pharmacist took the hand: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, what should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whispering sound suddenly disappeared, and the silence in the room seemed to solidify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the pharmacist was not afraid of the condemnation of the last time, Klein thought about it and took the initiative to speak:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "If I were you, I thought I would give up the rest of the herbs and never go there again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? They will mature soon The wild beasts hide in the depths of the sewers and generally do not come out." The pharmacist asked hesitantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein deliberately hoarse voices:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There should be an organization behind 'Black Snake' His death will inevitably lead to investigation, I think you should not be willing to deal with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The possession of "listener" does not mean "black snake" It must be a member of the Aurora, but he called the "real creator" as a great existence to confirm this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, this kind of thing would rather be true and not a lucky one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." The pharmacist nodded slightly and seemed to have made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein added a few more sentences:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it were me, I would also anonymously This matter was reported to the police."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Many party members were horrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein's tone is invariably explained:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the beast of the sewer can make 'black The serpent's death means that they are very dangerous, and everyone lives in Bakerland. If it is really a disaster, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not spread to itself."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, the best option is to get the police to pay attention and let the official handle this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can do it without risk It’s not great to enjoy good results?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice just fell, the “eye of wisdom” old gentleman applauded:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great ideas! We are afraid of the extraordinary people of the official, but we can also use them, don't think about anything to deal with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because I am an official extraordinary person, and the idea is definitely different from your pure wildness... Klein laughs with a belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After speaking, he returned to the attitude of watching, listening to others selling or seeking shopping products, materials, looking at a pile of transactions or success or failure, there is no sense Interested things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not hanged out the extraordinary variety of materials he needs, and plans to observe the circle several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, and the "eye of wisdom" old man begins to arrange for people to leave, three minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein went out first, didn’t know what to follow, and now noticed that there are at least five exits, the waiter of the Eye of Wisdom will bring Different people walk different channels, try to open and extend the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, there are three party members left in the living room, except for the "eye of wisdom", the other two are Klein and suspected pharmacists. Man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Eye of Wisdom" looked at Klein, and his voice laughed wildly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It seems that you are lucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recognized that I was the last person to buy the "black snake" ominous item... Klein smiled and said: " Yes, I am gambling to win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
