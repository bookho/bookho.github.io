			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tired Klein lifted the sealed spiritual wall, letting the cool breeze of the night blow on his face with the smell of vegetation, blowing him sober A few points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stunned the classic seal of the palm of his hand, "3—0782", and sighed inwardly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who can think of this badge is a fusion of a god of blood... It is estimated that the strong eternal church members of the church have searched but have not found..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the activity of the lower neck, Klein did not dare to try another idea, wearing the "variant sun emblem" on the inside of the thin trench coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed the chain and pulled out a silver pocket watch with a vine pattern. He glanced openly and glanced at it. He found that the distance from the "collector" Frye was changed. There is more than an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My eyelids need two matches to support... this is the sequela of death!" Klein had no choice but to take a small pocket from a grid. Remove a metal vial, pull out the stopper, and put it to the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of mint and disinfectant mixed together quickly penetrated his nose, stimulating his granules to emerge, the spirit is a vibration, instant Forgotten the sleepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the formula he learned from the "collector" Fry, called "The Crag Oil", which can help people fight the stench of decay and other odors. It has a refreshing effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next hour or so, Klein was suffering, and stood up and walked from time to time, several times being bitten by mosquitoes in the woods. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he saw Frye with a thin nose and a dark blue hair, wearing a thin windbreaker, holding a cane and walking out of the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the other party is still a cold and gloomy as a living corpse, but Klein is like seeing the savior, while yawning and yawning, tears full Hey, while welcoming up, remove the seal "3 - 0782" from the inside of the clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Frye looked at his teammate's pale, ugly face and asked for a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was only observing Chanis Gate last night. I didn’t sleep very well this morning, so it’s very sleepy now.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t mention this thing, he opened the topic: “I am four hours. Later, rotation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Seven hours, the captain does not need to sleep in the middle of the night." Frye took over the "variant sun emblem." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultivating the fairy makes people happy... Klein silently smashed the captain and said goodbye to Frye and went to the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to the hotel along the street, he took out his pocket watch and watched the time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hey, ten minutes earlier than the agreed time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a warm person..." Klein smiled and speeded up Speed, back to the hotel, pushed open the door of the half-cover, walked up the second floor in the eyes of the boss, and entered the room belonging to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lock the door, take off the coat and shoes, he did not clean himself, fell down directly, fell to the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a matter of ten seconds, his nose first became heavier, then long and steady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his sleep, Klein returned to Earth, in front of him, he had not played the game of customs clearance, with iced cola and spicy chicken wings on the left, right side Bitter bamboo shoots soup and rice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not eaten bitter bamboo shoots, but he likes to use it as a soup made of meat and meat. The soup is refreshing and appetizing. It is perfect to have a meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a good dish of food, he can eat a whole bowl of rice than usual! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klein is ready to enjoy the nightingale and play the game crazy, his dream scene changes and reappears as the interior of No. 2 Narcissus Street. pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein suddenly felt alert and knew clearly that he was in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw himself sitting on the side of the table, holding a copy of the Tingen Daily, with tomato oxtail soup and fried lamb chops in front of him. , mashed potatoes and oatmeal bread and other foods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously turned his head and looked at the door position, suddenly saw the living room corresponding to the convex belly window standing outside the shadow of the figure, is quietly staring at the figure inside the house! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was shocked and immediately recognized that it was a gray and faint Dunn, who was half-faced against the window and silently looking at the people inside. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Captain, don’t be scared in your dreams, okay? Is this the way you play nightmares? Klein thought with anger and funny, took out the spoon, took a piece of beef, and put it in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it’s my craft! He secretly sighed and understood why he suddenly became awake in his dreams, and why the scenes of the earth disappeared instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When someone invades his dreams, he will naturally be alert! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Dunn left the position of the belly window and directly pushed the door of Moretti’s house, wearing a black windbreaker, and walked quietly to the gram. The opposite of Ryan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off his hat, gently daggered, sat down, and picked up the knife and fork and ridiculously, and took the table at a very fast speed. Tomato oxtail soup, fried lamb chops, mashed potatoes and oatmeal bread were eaten clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at him in a dull, unclear what the captain wanted to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, Dunn sighed with satisfaction, slid his thumb at Klein, then took out the pipe and the match and took a sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking out of the cloud, he stood up and took the hat, the old school but steadyly took a ritual, and stepped away from Moretti’s house and left the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Klein looked at the captain’s back and couldn’t return to it for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down at the empty plate and subconsciously wanted to reproduce the food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this time, regardless of tomato oxtail soup, or fried lamb chops, mashed potatoes, did not continue to appear in his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be thoroughly swallowed? Is this the ability of 'nightmare'?" Klein twitched his mouth, reluctantly thinking, "So, the captain's The purpose is to make me not have a nightingale in my dreams? This is really a nightmare... This 'nightmare' is really creative..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughs Exit the dream and sleep again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning at 5:30, Klein, who had to get up early, drank coffee, ate toast and bacon, and hurriedly went outside the town to replace it. Dunn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At seven o'clock, they returned to Tingen City on time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undering ten o'clock, they arrived at No. 36 Zouteland Street, and the spirited Diane put the seal "3 - 0782" back to the Chanis Gate Later, Frye sat in front of the mechanical typewriter, and personally wrote yesterday's mission report and corresponding consumable reimbursement application when the civilian staff was not in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein watched for a while and satisfactorily saw that all the materials he had used were included in the list - including the part he used to repel mosquitoes . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not go home immediately, because he had already written a secret letter to Dawster doctor of the madhouse to meet at the scheduled place at one o'clock in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then there are three more Tarot gatherings... Why do I have to live so tired of a hidden organization's BOSS?" Klein silently said that in the night Lying in the lounge for two hours, make up for sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the knowledge and things he got last night, he is not worried about forgetting. This can be recalled by divination. He is afraid that he ignores these. The existence of knowledge and things, even the ideas of divination are lost, so he went through the details in his mind before going to bed to deepen his impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Klein insists on writing a summary every week to sort out the various situations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
