			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the "Sun" Dairik finished speaking, Klein manipulated the "world" and nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "More detailed than I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transaction completed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"World "The voice has not fallen, and Klein has already released the shield of "justice", "downside down" and "magician". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene was quiet for a few seconds, and the "world" looked around in a circle, sullen and laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't have any other needs for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuls, who has roughly figured out the process and characteristics, is eager to try and want to buy the sequence corresponding to the "apprentice" 8 "Master of tricks." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clearly remembers that Mr. Fool said that the reason why he was troubled by the full moon slang was because the level of life was not high enough, the pain would Decreased as the sequence itself increases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Fols anxious to get a follow-up recipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this will expose the extraordinary way I am...and when everyone becomes familiar, knows each other more, the exposure is exposed, it’s not too serious Things, but in recent gatherings, I still have to cover up, lest I be locked up by the party members to lock the reality... Fols thought calmly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I want the formula of 'pharmacist' and 'master of tricks' to trade with money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She deliberately added to her real needs "Pharmacist" formula, in order to interfere with other people's judgment, if any member really has this formula, she will eat as usual, after the increase to sell to the prince of Glaiglin, who has long been waiting for the recipe, she will certainly not And if you suffer, you might make a big profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for money, Fols is not lacking for the time being, not only is the royalties of her own best-selling book still entering her account in a pen, and it’s a lot less. And she has additional benefits, such as the 650 pounds paid from Miss Audrey in the two incidents of Qi Lingus and Intis Ambassador Becker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poorly taking a break, he paid for the family of the two deceased in the Lalhus incident and spent more than two hundred pounds. Will Miss Audrey reimburse her? The note with the name "Mr. Fool" was found in the book mezzanine of the Greelet family. Was one of his ancestors a member of this party? Is this a gathering that has been held for dozens of hundred years? Fols's thoughts suddenly became a little divergent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her only two seats, "Justice" Audrey was only slightly aware of the recipes of the "pharmacists" and "drama masters". At a glance, it accurately grasps the other's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is Fols! 'Master of the Master' is for her own, 'pharmacist' is sold to Grein, and confused Sight, blinding others..." Audrey is not visible to the dagger, and the identity of the "magician" has been determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequence itself is not high, at most 8, at most it is only 9, and I don’t know where Mr. Fool was pulled from, what is special? ... accent with Beckland features, but not necessarily in Beckland... "After hanging people" Alger is also observing new members, initially confirming that the other party will not pose a threat to themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sun" Dairik did not think so much, just speculating that "Magician" Miss belongs to the Silver City area, or Miss "Justice" and others live That world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the "Magician" with pity, and had no hope of her attempt to hide her identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you meet a "reader" who is familiar with you, even if you know the ability of the other person in advance and you are wary, It doesn't necessarily conceal the true idea, let alone you don't know anything... "The Fool" Klein sighed for the "Magician" in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he manipulated the "world" and hoarsely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for the recipe of the master of tricks, I will try my best to find you, but I can't guarantee success."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the "pharmacist" formula to exchange money and use it to train A useful helper is not contradictory, it can be carried out at the same time, so Klein let the "world" preemptively open, so as not to be "upside down" and "sun". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the recipe of "Master of Juggling", he only has some ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, the magical item of "Master Key" has a high probability of being associated with the sequence "Apprentice" corresponding to the "Master of the Master", above the fog. Divination under its source, maybe you can find some clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in fact, the most convenient way is to ask the person who is suspected of "Men", he constantly whispers at the full moon, in addition to asking for help, it is estimated that there is also teaching Formulating and playing the game to make the target strong and complete difficult tasks, but unfortunately, before the goal is strong, there is no way to listen to his slang. When you hear it, it will collapse and there will be signs of loss of control. This will form an infinite loop. ... Klein sighed with emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falth did not rush to respond to the words of the "world", and turned around and found "upside down", "justice" and " The sun does not mean to open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, they don’t know what the recipes for “pharmacists” and “masters of tricks” are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. 'World', I hope you can find the potion formula of the Master of the Master of the Master as soon as possible." Fols silenced for a few seconds, "and the pharmacist 'The formula, I am ready to buy now, how can I pay?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party seems to be a Lun, willing to accept the golden pound... However, Kim The pound has always been more recognized than coins such as Jinhorn, Intiffer, etc. While speaking, Firth is also judging the origin of the "world." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The World" did not care about her, completely said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After you go back, Give the cash sacrifice to Mr. 'Footer', so the transaction is complete."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The specific sacrifice process is..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salute? Can Mr. Fool still accept sacrifices? Has his life level reached this level? No wonder he used that tone to describe the owner of the full moon slang... Fols was shocked and awkward and listened to it, remembering it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the narrative is finished, Klein has a "pharmacist" formula in front of the "world", and the dummy is handed to the "magician" Miss:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The transaction is witnessed by Mr. 'fool', you don't have to worry about being fake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe 'Mr. Fool'." Fols nodded immediately, unfolding the formula and remembering it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, I couldn’t bear to be so hard, "justice" Audrey said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You can ask Mr. Fool's to help you when you sacrifice. You don't need to remember in particular. If you encounter problems, you can pray to Him by mourning your name."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He? Miss "Justice" even used the person who represents the god to call the pronoun "Mr. Fool"! He, He... Is it really ‘hi’? However, why is He willing to help these little things... No, as long as the ritual magic is appropriate, the seven orthodox gods often respond to the believers and complete their requests... Firth sideways to the "justice":<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your reminder, your title is your character."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Audrey suddenly has a bit Mindfulness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately thought of a question and was busy saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Magician Do you know 'playing the law'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"playing the law?" Foers looked at the other side in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's party made me feel like a country girl who just arrived in Beckland... I have participated in so many extraordinary gatherings! Half of the sorrow is half sorrowful and happy to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but write a novel with this feeling of emotion, called "Mr. Wall Dreams Travel". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't seem to be clear." Audrey made a positive judgment based on the reaction of the other party and the performance of peacetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her body and looked at the top of the old long table, the shadow of the person shrouded in thick fog:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Mr. Fool's, can you tell the 'player' to the 'Magician'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If so, what does she need to pay?" The price?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey originally intended to ask directly whether it was in exchange for the new Russell Diary as before, but immediately thought of the extraordinary of Firth The circle of people and their own have a lot of overlap, so that they will lose many opportunities to get a Russell diary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a very important issue, and Fowls will sooner or later know that Mr. Fool needs Russell’s diary, and I will definitely have other extraordinary circles. However, she knows that I have a few pages of Russell's diary. If I want to collect it, the first one I am looking for is definitely me, but my diaries, Mr. Fool, have seen it... After this party, I have to Looking for an opportunity to tell Fols, saying that those Russell diaries were accidentally lost... "Justice" Audrey deduced a chain reaction, trying to show his fears to the "fool" in body language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does Miss Justice mean? Well, she and Fols know, but don't want to reveal her identity, that is, she doesn't want my rewards to cause trouble in this area... Klein chuckled thoughtfully:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You decide, you explain, I don't want to repeat similar topics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is respect for the goddess ... he added a sentence in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same "Mr." "Justice" Audrey's heart is full of enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She straightens her back and slightly lifts her chin, trying to look at the "magician" in the same way as usual:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Playing the law' is a way to speed up the mastery of the potion and minimize the risk of losing control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there another way? true or false? Such a high-level figure of "Mr. Fool" will certainly not deceive in such a small matter! Folsic’s eyes were slightly lazy and he licked his lips:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Think!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As long as it is extraordinary, there is no need to know similar methods! Fols suddenly got a little excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audrey seriously thought about the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two requirements, one is not getting The permission of Mr. 'fool' cannot tell the 'playing law' to others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second is to pay 200 pounds."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her original intention was to use the Russell Diary discount. When she and the "downside man" used how many page diaries to repay, they were converted into the corresponding price, but in reality, Russell Because the diary can't be cracked, it sells very cheaply, and in many cases, the true and false can't be determined. The total price converted is somewhat sorry for "playing the law", so she added some extras on this basis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well... If Mr. Fool’s family is no longer short of money, then I will accept the £200 and then look for the diary to Mr. Debt... Audrey has already thought about the follow-up transaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200 pounds? Can I reduce the risk of losing control by 200 pounds? This is too, too cheap, right? Fright and happy, Fols feared the other party's remorse and said without hesitation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
