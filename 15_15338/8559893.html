			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danizi held the copper knife and made a few strokes on the back of his left hand, hesitating that there was no force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his head and squeezed his smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although there have been many injuries, The pain still makes me afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking." Klein responded indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniz smiled and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, it’s a bit scary."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice just fell, his right hand has already made a force, using a copper knife to draw a hole on the back of the hand, just now the words seem to just divert attention, to relieve the mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood quickly overflowed, and Daniz was busy putting down the knife, using his right hand finger to pick up the blood and smearing it on the dark brown cover of Grosser's Travels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing this step, he held his breath and waited for change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, there was a goose-sized snowflake in front of his eyes, and a whistling wind in his ear, followed by a bitter cold madness into his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Daniz has been psychologically prepared, but at this moment is still amazed, instinct will look around and determine where. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that he did not know when he had left the Captain’s Room of the Golden Dream and was in a frosty land covered by snowstorms because of the extremely harsh environment. I can't see the distance at all, I can't even judge whether I am on the mountain or the plain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really entered a strange world...the captain is here too? Daniz raised his hand in front of his face, afraid of being blinded by the wind and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmed down, remembered the explanation of German Sparrow, and took the stack of squared papers from his trouser pocket, carefully Unfolding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, he is afraid of accidents, causing the paper to be broken or blown away, which will make him lose all hope. Fortunately, That didn't happen, he saw what Gelman Sparrow wrote:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use Hermes, preferably Old Hermes, 诵Read the following names:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fools who do not belong to this era;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"above the fog Mysterious master; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The king of yellow and black who is in good luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After reading, burn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...this is a god-level secret presence? Because of the strict teaching of Ai Wenna, the iceberg Lieutenant, Daniz is not illiterate in the field of occult, and even has a good foundation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the paper in hand Article, he subconsciously took a cold breath, inhaled the biting cold wind and cold snow, suddenly coughing, distorted expression.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can now confirm the previous one Guessing: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German.Sparo really belongs to a very powerful and very secret organization, and that organization believes in a god called "fool" Level exists!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, such a powerful and crazy guy will not have no origin, not just casually in the ground... Danizla Pulling the neckline, tightening the clothes, looking at the note that danced in the wind, there was a clear hesitation on his face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very clear about his mourning It’s a dangerous thing that I don’t know the hidden existence of good and evil, which may lead to more terrible than death. The ending!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain is also trapped here, and there is no way to go out... Daniz has a fist in front of his mouth.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Golden Dream", the captain's interior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein witnessed Daniz first to become illusory without reason, and then disappeared, no doubt about the way to enter the "Grossel Travels" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patience waited for a while, his ears screamed in a phantom stack of prayers, and apparently from men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, it seems that "Grossel Travels" can't cut off the fog, the world in the book can still connect the mysterious space... this way, Even if I follow, I don't have no cards in the back... Klein sighed with no disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to confirm, he once again reversed four steps, mourning the mantra, entering the fog, and seeing the spot representing Deniz in the high back of the fool. A circle around the chair swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the body that enters with the soul... The world in the book is very solid and can't be broken by pulling the spirit... Also, if you can, the previous divination There is a corresponding revelation... 'Poseidon's scepter' is too dangerous, and directly 'given' to Daniz, will only let him die quickly..." Klein half-closed his eyes, spread out of spirituality, sensed for a while, and reached many conclusions. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not delay, immediately returned to the real world, picked up the copper knife and wiped the Daniz blood from the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fold the paper and put it in your pocket, he starts thinking about what to do next:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It seems that you have to smear the blood and go straight in, so you don't have to worry about your body accidents, and you can solve the problem quickly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it can't be careless and negligent, you have to guard against another Danger, um... If there is a problem with the ship, after I enter the "Grossel Travels", I will look for an opportunity to sneak into the captain's room and sacrifice the book to the 'real creator', 'original witch' or 'hidden sage ', then I am in trouble, I am sure that life is better than death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Most of the crew of the 'Golden Dream' seem to admire the 'Iceberg Lieutenant', Anderson's previous superficial provocation can be effective enough to explain a lot The problem, therefore, telling them that the relationship 'the iceberg lieutenant' lives, let them supervise each other, no one can enter, can be assured.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anderson, he is the strongest hunter, more powerful than any other person on board, and is good at ambushing and sneaking. There is no small possibility to avoid the supervision of others and sneak into the captain's room... his origins are not too clear. Can't make me really believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to find a way for him to enter the "Grossel Travels" with me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thinking, Klein turned over the old book of the tan-colored parchment and found that there was no more content at this time. The story also lacked the traces of Daniz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, you must survive successfully, meet the protagonist, can you really become part of the story, and make the number of books appear more?" Klein Initially made a judgment, once again went to the door and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Successful?" "Flower Bow Tie" Jederson and others asked in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein shook his head and said calmly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There will be a long ritual <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one can come in and bother, or it will cause Edwina Edwards to disappear forever or die directly." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After explaining the main matters, he looked around and said it straightforwardly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I doubt Who among you has a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, you supervise each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Foodies" Bruce Wols I had to habitually refute, and suddenly I saw that the captain’s room was empty and I had disappeared from Daniz, who had just entered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be responsible for this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And they will supervise me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn't look at it and turned to Anderson Hood on the opposite wall:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"You come in. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson lifted the right corner of his mouth and snorted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know Thought that I am your subordinate, your attitude is simply a model of provocative. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He groaned, his body still straightened, taking a slow pace and stepping into the captain's room.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After closing the door and unlocking it, Klein turned to face Anderson: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there any interest in participating in a rare adventure? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may be able to achieve the achievements of the hunting dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to these observations, He believes that Anderson Hood is a hunter who combines curiosity and adventurous spirit. He is very happy to see new things and experience the excitement that has never happened before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson stared at the face of German Sparrow, carefully looked for a few seconds, then smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No interest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head resolutely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, he grabbed before Klein spoke again, smirking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I" Smell 'to the dangerous atmosphere, a self-sufficient crazy powerful adventurer actually invited me to take risks, what does this mean? It shows that things are very troublesome and very dangerous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I thought you would be interested, this is not the same as your usual performance, really can put it in.... Well, try the intimidation method again. If you can’t, throw this guy on the desert island and let “Gold "Dream" drove away, and then came back to pick him up. As a hunter, it would be hard for him to survive on a desert island... Klein quickly decided that the lithography would turn cold and watch Anderson: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't leave a hidden danger to myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson stayed for a second and quickly piled up with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, just kidding, I am very interested in the title of Dragon Hunter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;......You become too fast...you can stick to it and you can enjoy the treatment that you can eat.... Klein nodded and walked back to the desk position, and followed Anderson Hood: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not use too much to apply the cover of this book with your blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Smudge it?" Anderson looked at the "Grossel Travels" curiously, and then looked around. "Adewenna's disappearance is related to it? The disappearance of the failed hunter is also? Ah, yes,' Flame 'Daniz, almost forgot his name, but fortunately he now has a higher bounty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein’s mouth fretting, replied calmly: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Somewhat..." Anderson glanced at the desk and picked up the Putting a copper knife in a careless manner, he made a hole in his hand and made blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he carefully lowered the knives and applied the blood to the dark brown cover of Grosser's Travels. Observed for a few seconds, Anderson was about to pick up a copper knife and wipe off the remaining blood, which was suddenly covered by a raging storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Anderson and Daniz disappeared, Klein picked up a piece of paper and wiped the blood from the copper knife and folded it. Pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
