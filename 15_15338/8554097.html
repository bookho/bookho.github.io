			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western District, 2 King's Road, Kingdom Museum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is not a weekend, when Klein arrived, there was a long queue at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the descriptions of newspapers and magazines, he knows that the world’s middle class has less entertainment, reading newspapers, reading novels, listening to opera concerts, playing tennis and Outside the squash, watching a variety of plays, holding or attending banquet dances, there are only three options for visiting the park, watching the exhibition and going out for vacation. Due to the influence of Russell the Great, annual leave is a common phenomenon in this class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After nine o'clock, wearing a half-high silk hat, a black cane, and a double-breasted long dress, Klein took the ticket and followed the people in front. Step by step into the museum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a diversion here, and different interpreters each lead some visitors to embark on different channels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and a dozen or twenty people followed behind a well-dressed woman, listening to her introduction to Russell's life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is meaningless to Klein, who is a half historian, so he bored the position of the wallet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Because of the surge in wealth, it reached 952 pounds, only one step away from 1,000 pounds, so his wallet can not hold so much cash, only They can selectively carry some of them, and the rest of them, Klein does not care that they stay at home without protection, so they are all thrown into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on, they entered the first exhibition hall, the female commentator said excitedly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, here are the daily necessities of Russell the Great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look, that's the velvet quilt he covers, that It is the gold-plated glassware he used to drink wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the toilet he used, the first toilet in the modern sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used toilets have been used for exhibitions? Klein suddenly had a little sympathy for Russell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he looked at the toilet behind the glass wall and found it was shining golden, the surface seemed to have a layer of gold foil and carved with exaggerated and artistic sense. Pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a luxury... Klein no longer sympathizes with Russell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a layer of glass in the toilet. It is Russell’s daily clothing, including cuffs and pleated shirts at the neckline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the female commentator is quite appreciative of the clothing culture of Intis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the "Exhibition Hall", it is the manuscript of the important documents promulgated by Russell, including the high-value historical relics such as the Civil Code. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the female commentator pointed to a showcase:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is one of the notes left by Russell the Great. It uses his original mysterious symbol that has not been cracked yet. Many historians and archaeologists believe that these notes should be recorded by Russell the Great. The least known secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a romantic person, I also have my own guess, perhaps this is Russell and his beloved The symbol that the woman agreed, they recorded each other, but they could never really be together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are very suitable for writing novels... Klein’s mouth is pumping, The line of sight then turned to the note that was spread out in the showcase. The above is the simplified Chinese that he is familiar with: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"March 6th, Mommy, here I am quick and constipated by food!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On March 22, it was time to choose the faith, one side is the eternal pilgrimage church, and the other side is the artisan church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My choice is nothing Doubt, praise you, the god of all things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One day, I want the craftsman church to be called mechanical god."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Sure enough romantic... Romantic constipation... This should be Russell’s crossing the early diary, no valuable information... his words are ugly than I am... Klein regained his gaze and sighed a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he only saw the two pages that were spread out, and what else remains, is not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how the guards here are doing, are there any chances to sneak in and read it again... Klein looks around and finds the security guards on the face It is quite a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be extraordinary people in the church of steam and machinery...he swears, follows the female commentator, mixes among a group of people, and enters the next The exhibition hall, called "Rose Rose". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the first love letter written by Russell the Great, this is his first love poem, 'When you are old'..." Women The interpreter pointed his way to the manuscript road in the showcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shameless! Yeats' coffin board can't hold it anymore! Klein couldn't help but whisper in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is his own bracelet... This is the manuscript of the novel he wrote..." The female commentator introduced it in an unusually adoring tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein tried not to change his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he also believes that Russell the Great in the profession of "artisans" must have a strong manual ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is his basic education textbook for educating his children. Every word has a corresponding picture... This is a small game he invented for his children. Similar to Intis chess, but I don’t know why, the law has not been circulated... This is the building block toy he invented, and it is also for his children...” The female commentator unknowingly brought a few warm feelings . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This TM is not just a chess game...and, Lego wants you to collect royalties! Klein can only tilt his mouth to cover up other emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swept over and found a woman with a height of more than one meter seven in front of the showcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lady has a chestnut hair with a long waist and a waist. The body is very good, neither fat nor thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was wearing a girlish yellow cake skirt, but wearing a black old-fashioned soft hat, fine gauze hanging down, covering her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood in front of the showcase and kept staring at the items inside, for a long time without leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they went to the next showroom with Klein, she still hadn’t changed her posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several exhibition halls, the female commentator pointed to the front:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What you will see next is the restored study of Russell the Great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, only part of it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the talking room, Klein and others entered the exhibition hall and opened their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has almost become a library, surrounded by rows of bookshelves, up to two-story bookshelves, with stairs below them, with access to each other. Formed a three-dimensional book park. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is conceivable that the owner here climbed up and down the stairs to find the book he wanted to read..." The presenter described a vivid Picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Russell will definitely let the servant look for it, not personally... Klein silently refutes one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a glance, Klein found a stack of manuscripts with a yellow-colored manuscript. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stack of manuscripts is not spread out, so people can only see the contents of the homepage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above depicts a rectangular item with detailed instructions:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is The portable miniaturization application of the telegraph machine can be connected to people who hold the same items, send and receive messages that they want to exchange, and even talk directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This requires better positioning. I think we can boldly turn our attention to the sky, where there is no obstacle and we can better spread the signal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater, you don’t even let the phone go... Kline couldn’t help but reach out and lick his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the interpreter introduced the stack of manuscripts:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;".........there are records It is the whimsy of Russell the Great, which records the invention that he has not yet had time to turn into reality, and records the brilliance of our human civilization!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Klein didn't listen to the words of the tout, and looked at something else at random. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he found a bookmark on a hard-shell book on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exposed part of the bookmark depicts the child's hand-drawn image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell is not good at drawing... Klein just sneered in his heart and suddenly remembered one thing:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell once disguised a "Big Card" as a bookmark and caught it in a book! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will this be this? Klein observed it for a few seconds without any trace, but found no clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the Emperor said that the "Golden Card" anti-predition anti-prophecy, under normal circumstances, can not find its special ... if so simple can be identified, steam The church with the god of machinery must have been taken away... Klein moved his eyes and looked at other books, and found that many books were sandwiched with a bookmark, and these bookmarks were different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He indulged, using the ability of the "clown" to control the facial muscles, curiously asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Is this a book that Russell has seen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I mean, are these original books? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female commentator must nod.:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, these are the original Luo Items in Serge's study, including but not limited to books, manuscripts, bookmarks, light stands, ink bottles... However, more things have been destroyed in several conflicts."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein gently decapitated and reviewed the bookmarks again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell mentioned in his diary that he wants to put the "card of shackles" in a valuable book for everyone I don't think the most valuable thing in that book is actually a humble bookmark... Well, which books are valuable? Klein recalled the details of the diary and used it to exclude it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glorious Age", unlike...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The History of the Kingdom of Intis", no Like...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northern Geographical Geography, this is possible, but not high...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Improvement Principles of Steam Machinery", ibid....<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein swept over and his eyes suddenly stopped on the first stack of manuscripts he saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are records of earth objects that Russell wanted to invent but did not conditionally invent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
