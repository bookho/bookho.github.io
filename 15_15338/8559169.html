			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein had some curiosity about the results of the exploration, no more questions, crossed the captain’s room and went down the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps, his throat was itchy, and he couldn’t help but put his fist in front of his mouth and coughed twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Klein is not surprised, because this is inevitable, and he took the "biotoxin bottle" last night. After two hours, until the night was quiet, confirming that the "on the star" side did not attack the intention, the magical item was transferred to the black suitcase, and it was tragically ill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, his time to carry the "biotoxin bottle" is not too long, the body is not in a weak state, the condition is relatively mild, just a simple sore throat . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slow-paced Jia De Li Ya saw this scene, but did not feel any problems, but thought it was normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical items must have negative effects that are learned by the extraordinary people who know, and they also learn the seven churches, the negative effects are very serious, difficult to long-term Carry the type of seal that is often used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Jia De Li Ya sells or redeems many magical items in the middle and lower levels is because they want to be stronger and improve their survivability. It is a kind of negative effect that is too much trouble. It is often circumvented. It can't be avoided. Even some negative effects will overlap each other, producing one plus one and two effects. For the extraordinary, the disadvantage is greater than the benefit. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found that after the magical objects, extraordinary weapons, and spiritual spells were armed to the teeth, she was already guessing the other side. What kind of negative impact will it bear? Today, it seems that it is simply a disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps came to the deck calmly, and Klein saw Frank Lee at a glance. He still had a white shirt with a pair of bibs, his cuffs were high and his arms were stained. With the sludge, it seems that there is no fear of the cold wind blowing under the clear sky. "Good morning, German." Frank waved enthusiastically. "Come, check out my latest achievements. Things!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said while lifting the other hand up, holding a wide variety of sea fish in the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I don't want to know what "monsters" you made out... Klein stopped and looked indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franke Lee did not notice that his attitude was wrong, took a dagger from his waist, brushed the ground into the sea fish, and then opened a hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood flowed out and fell into the large beer mug on the deck, but there was no rumor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smell it? What an intoxicating scent!" Frank Lee said with a half-closed eyes, "This is a red wine." The blood of the fish, the wine also carries a lot of nutrients!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein found himself unable to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank looked at the sailors around with excitement and said to German Sparrow:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what we are most troubled at sea? That is when the wine is finished and not yet docked! As long as the fish can quickly reproduce and become the main product of the sea, no matter where we are, There will be no shortage of wine, yes, they will have a variety of varieties, some produce strong anger, some produce Nipos, some produce red wine, some produce beer, beer must use sharks with whales, otherwise not enough to drink !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most troublesome thing is not water shortage? Of course, most of the time you take beer instead of water, because it is less prone to spoilage... Poor fish... Klein is wondering how to respond to Frank, "Star above" Jia Delia also came to the deck. Cross him and ask his mate:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is Nina ready?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, she has already drunk a bottle of Nebos!" Frank pointed to a shadow made by the sail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called preparation is to drink a bottle of Visa special Nipos, where you can draw a match on Nipos? Klein suddenly felt that the lady named Nina mentioned by Mr. Grande should have the pedigree of Fossac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, I hope more is a bottle of Sunia blood wine!" The shadow slowly stood up and walked out of a female figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is over 1 meter tall, and her blond hair is arbitrarily tied into a high ponytail. The facial features are not outstanding, but there are obvious Fossack features, white eyes. light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lady named Nina is wearing black skinny clothing made of fish skin, and it seems that she is all in one, and her hot body is completely finished. All outlined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style itself is quite sexy, Nina’s chest is more than the limit of fouls, and the pirates around me have what it means. And know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was a bit too uncomfortable and wanted to look away, but thought that Gilman Sparo was definitely not such a green person, so he had to be slightly emptied. Look, looking at Nina's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"German, this is our sailor, Nina! She is also the deputy of the sailor, haha, her serial name is called 'voyager' "Frank Lee is still unreservedly introduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "toxin expert" is very simple outside the study of hybrids... I remember, this lady Nina bounty is 3,600 pounds, nickname "Undersea killer", hey, look at the wanted order too much, and some can't recall it... Kline looked at Nina's eyes and nodded plainly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, madam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nina smiled and looked at Klein from top to bottom:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, Mr. Sparo.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am curious, 'Immune will' is not like in the rumor charming? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a female pirate who has been in the middle and lower levels for a long time, she has always been straightforward in men and women, and she did not want to ask Galman directly. Is Sparrow alone not attractive enough, or whether the other party is a cold type, so he completely ignored it, and there is no reaction, but considering that there is a strong guy standing in front of him, a dangerous hunting "sickness lieutenant" succeeds. The adventurer, a madman who might shoot a gun at any time, retracted the ridiculous words and rushed back to ask the "sickness of the disease."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;......This makes me answer you? Klein is silent: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her bounty is very attractive. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nina stunned for a second, didn't know how to pick up this topic, but turned to look at the "star above":<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, do you start now? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cardella, who had inexplicably flashed his bounty in his mind, turned his head to Nina:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Start. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice just fell, Nina strode to the edge of the ship's side, her right hand, jumped directly into the sea, like a big black fish, going downstream At the same time, several sailors followed and made a certain response.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...the beginning of the beginning, there is no room for buffering... This lady is very temperamental of the storm church, and it is worthy of being a "sailor" approach... Klein looks out of the boat, I couldn't help but cough again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is I sick? Frank Lee asked directly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein indifferent dagger:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank thought about it, didn't say hello, and ran back to the cabin, not knowing where to go.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Next to the "Star above" Jia De Liya pushed down his heavy glasses, smiling slightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frank is a 'toxin expert' It is also an excellent doctor. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really is the "cultivator" approach... Klein didn't ask much, stood there, waiting for Nina to complete the initial exploration.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
