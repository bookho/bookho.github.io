			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the herbs wrapped in yellow-brown paper, Bogda fainted away from the “Rossen Folk Herbal Shop”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he waited for the public carriage, he woke up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full 10 pounds Have you bought such a package? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is close to your monthly salary! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t believe in Anna and Joyce, you can’t bring so much cash to the Divination Club! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't just charge 8 pence for divination, is it to work with the black-hearted boss of Rosen Herbs to earn more? This is very similar to the classic fraud case in the newspaper! Before and after Bogda's association, he was a bit suspicious of Klein and even suspected Joyce and Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public carriage stopped. He looked at the herbs in his hand and eventually failed to return with a thick face. He could only enter the compartment with a heavy heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rossen's folk herbalist shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss looked at the back of Bogda and went back to the back door where the herbs were stacked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Shelmin, don't start buying herbal medicines today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? Teacher, why?" A handsome boy with messy hair Got out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the 16th because of my fame. The customer, continue this way, I think the night, the punisher and the mechanical heart will notice me, it is time to consider going to other cities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this shop needing to be transferred?" Shermin nodded and asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss sighed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to stay, you can do this The owner of the store, in terms of distinguishing herbs and formulating pharmacy, your ability is enough. Of course, 50% of your monthly profit is remembered to be deposited into my unregistered account at Beckland Bank."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, I haven't learned what you really are good at." Shelmin is tired of a city that can't live for a year, and is quite reluctant to teach the teacher's magical formula. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss sat on the lounge chair and swayed leisurely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is not to learn You can learn..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cup of black and green boiling liquid appears In front of Bogda, the stinky smell, the color that makes people want to vomit, makes him deeply doubtful about today's every move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the cock that just flowed out was dripped into the potion, and Bogda’s father looked at his son with anxiety:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think surgery is the best choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not much cock blood tumbling in boiling liquid for a few times, disappeared, Bogda took a deep breath: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this drug does not work, I will consider surgery."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord will bless you." Bogda's father painted a triangular emblem on his chest,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waiting boiling liquid change Cool, Bogda holds the idea that he can't waste 10 pounds of money, his right hand is lifted, his eyes are closed, his head is raised, and he will drink all the medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening, Bogda found that he had eaten his stomach and went to the bathroom six times. When the moon of blush was about to disappear, he fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, he suddenly woke up because he dreamed of the company’s boss’s reprimand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, fortunately, I have been invited for three days of annual leave, don't have to rush to the company." Bogda breathed a sigh of relief and suddenly found that his spirit was quite it is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in stark contrast to the low state of the past few weeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bogda subconsciously reached out and pressed the right side of the abdomen, only to feel a little bit of pain before the painful to intolerable area became normal, only ordinary Pressing pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't it really effective? The pharmacist is obviously fooling people..." Bogda turned and fell out of bed, surprised and puzzled. The activity starts from the body, and I feel that the long-lost health is back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He meditated for a long time, talking to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the pharmacist’s instructions, I have to drink the medicine twice. When I finish drinking, I will go to the hospital and find a doctor to take a look..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pharmacist did not seem to say Drink a few times a day..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I still think he is a bit like a liar..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the office of the Blackthorn Security Company’s civilian staff, Klein pleaded in advance to obtain an undisturbed environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the knives and shouted spirituality, seriously carving the spells and symbols on the two silver ornaments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the esoteric symbol that symbolizes the goddess of the night and symbolizes the Empress and the Queen of Fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, Klein also added the goddess corresponding to the number of "7" and related magic signs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, both sides of the spell and the amulet must be engraved, and which symbols, which spells, and which marks are placed on each side, where they occupy each position, What special format belongs to the advanced category of occultism, which is full of fallacies between ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Klein has a lot of sculpted materials on his right hand side - through repeated practice to confirm that he is proficient, he dares to Brother Banson and sister Melissa make amulets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spiritual precipitation, spirituality from the tip of his knives, and the number of "7" is outlined on the surface of the silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the silver mantra and symbols, he has carved, waiting for this side to finish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last knife fell, all the spirituality was connected together, and Klein suddenly felt the strange, majestic, horrible power in the room. move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surging quickly disappeared, and the two sides of the silver mantra were completely combined into a whole in Klein’s “Lingshi”, emitting a quiet and peaceful black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put down his knives and rubbed the silver ornaments of "circle" and "vertical", only to feel the touch of warmth with a bit of coolness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay!" He was pleased to give the previously produced amulet to the newly acquired pocket of the clothes, and he planned to give the opportunity to his brother Benson and Sister Melissa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——This amulet made by the extraordinary has a certain effect, which allows the wearer to unknowingly avoid a considerable degree of difficulty, but not too much Exaggeration, and, spirituality will be lost a little, unless high-level ritual magic is used, praying for complete solidification, otherwise the one-year use period is the limit, and high-order ritual magic has terrible requirements for spirituality, non-Klein Currently able to bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then re-use the spirituality to outline it again... Klein nodded thoughtfully and began to clean up the messy table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing the finishing work, Klein just stepped out of the civilian staff office and prepared to hand over the scrapped materials. He saw Captain Dunn coming over with a black trench coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash of Dunn’s sorrow is swept away, and the corners of his mouth are swayed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klein, The church has been approved, you are our full member."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? This is great!" Klein showed a surprise. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dune smiles and nods:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can now pay for this week's salary 3 pounds, then 4.5 pounds a week, until the advance payment is paid off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, have I mentioned the ceremony for the night?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every official night-time person must go to a task independently, and only then can he be recognized by his peers. Considering your outstanding performance before, I think it can be used. Instead of being entrusted with ordinary tasks, I will officially introduce you to all the night people in Tingen City at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein replied without hesitation: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 pounds plus reimbursement of 7 pounds, plus a set of formal wear There is no problem at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is quite a lot left! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I don’t know when I can wait until the task...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s Wait until Sunday, and wait until Selena’s birthday dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change the dress and clean the half-height silk hat with a brush and handkerchief Klein looked in the mirror and walked into the first floor with great satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Melissa is looking up and down Benson’s clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a problem?" Banson raised his cane and was stunned by his sister's gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has self-examined himself and felt that he had no problems and he was dressed well enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa retracted her eyes and said with a serious expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Banson, you are Very old dress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today's birthday party has a lot of outstanding ladies and ladies to attend, I think that you are wearing this dress is not for them. Respect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was full of doubts, and after hearing the emphasis of Melissa, she suddenly woke up and smiled and went up:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am similar to Benson's body, he can wear my other tuxedo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already My brother and sister accounted for a new purchase of a formal dress, saying that when checking some cultural relics, the clothes were stabbed and broken, so the company generously compensated. Of course, he concealed the "promotion and salary increase". The thing, afraid to scare Melissa and Benson, I plan to wait until half a year to tell them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This explanation is very enviable to Benson and Melissa, and feels that Blackthorn Security is really an unsightly employer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't this necessary?" Banson still asked the situation without clearing the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it is very necessary." Kline pushed Benson's shoulder to the stairs. "My tuxedo is hung on the coat rack. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After watching Benson’s face stunned, Klein turned and smiled at Melissa:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Do you want Benson to take advantage of the Selena birthday dinner to start a good relationship with a young lady?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
