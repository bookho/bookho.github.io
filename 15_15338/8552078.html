			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having had dinner, chatting for a while, Klein sat down on the single sofa in the living room, picked up the Akhova Evening News, which was just sent, and laid back leisurely. Read on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson bitterly faces, sitting opposite his sister, in front of Bella is a very clean table, grammar books, classical literature, accounting tutorials and Pen paper, similar to him, there are also textbooks and stationery in front of Melissa, including but not limited to pens, paper, rulers, compasses and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This makes me seem to have returned more than a decade ago, when I was a student at the school on Sunday." Benson complained, but still Lower your head and study hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this kind of scene makes me feel a sense of accomplishment for parents... Klein smiled and laughed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Knowledge changes fate, and strives to create brilliant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter half is what I just compiled, I don’t know if Russell has said ... He secretly groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room quickly became quiet, leaving only the tip of the pen across the paper and the sound of the book being flipped. Bella had already cleaned the tableware and finished the kitchen. She arrived at the bedroom on the first floor, which is the original small room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein read the newspaper, and occasionally took a cup of Xibo black tea, and chatted with his brother and sister a few words, very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the gas lamps in the living room and dining room are dimmed at the same time, as if they have lost enough fuel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson and Melissa lifted their heads indefinitely, looking at the lamps, trying to find the reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein also cast his sights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he felt something touched his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides him, there is something in the living room without a living person touching his arm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hair was raging, Klein’s arm shrank, turned his head and saw five tiny, pale fingers that grew on the top of the red tongue and below One more irregular fangs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein first explored the pocket, where there were "sad" and "soul" spells, and immediately saw the five babies with the same fingers A piece of paper that is folded neatly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;信......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courier! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein sighed with relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the five pale fingers holding the paper touched his arm lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked to Melissa, who was about to stand up to check the gas lamp, grabbed the left hand lightly, grabbed the letterhead, then flew back and hid under the newspaper. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the corner of his eye, the pale fingers, the red tongue and the irregular fangs instantly disappeared and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart, Klein scorned the left tooth and quietly opened the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the five small to abnormal fingers, saw the long red tongue with white fangs, and saw them retracted on the ground. No eyes and no nose in the transparent face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a second, the face was drilled into the ground, and the gas light in the living room and dining room returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Weird..." Melissa muttered, carefully checking for a long time and found no problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is our family responsible for this kind of thing, and the man is watching... Klein shakes his head and laughs, closing the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the spiritual creatures are willing to be seen and have the corresponding abilities, ordinary people can also find them. Just now is an example. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking to each other about the gas lamp, Moretti’s family became quiet again, and Banson and Melissa once again invested in the ocean of knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein used the cover of the newspaper to spread the stationery with one hand and clip it on the inner page to read the reply from the "Death Instructor" Dai Li:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... I have to emphasize it again, I prefer the title of 'Psychic'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you asked, I give a positive answer, yes,' Psychic can also be used on living creatures, remember, not just living humans..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this can be quite troublesome, too No small danger. The soul of the deceased remains pure, without too much impurities, without chaotic thoughts, can communicate without hindrance, ask questions, get answers, of course, you can also add the skills of 'dream divination' in this step. , directly see the corresponding picture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With a living human being, his own will still exists, resisting the unprotected spirit and spirit. Communicate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing here, Klein’s mouth twitches slightly Confirm that the respondent is Dai Li himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unprotected communication...It’s the style of her speech...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; looked up at my sister and brother, Klein continued to look at the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the face of this situation, we only have two ways, First, relying on its own powerful spirituality and profound psychic skills to overcome the will of the other party and communicate rudely. Second, with the aid of some drugs, let the other party relax. The most common ones I use are 'Amanda' and the 'Ling. Eyes 'Pills, huh, I believe you will definitely not have no impression."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After entering the formal psychic, you must pay attention to, different from and the deceased Remaining soul communication, this time, you are also in the spirit state, in simple terms, your spirituality has entered the spiritual world of each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For professional 'psychics', there is no lack of self-protection skills in this state, but you are not Even if the skills I master tell you, you can't learn, or use them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you must keep enough lucidity enough reason, Only in this way, you can resist the storm of mixed thinking of the other side, come to his spirit and communicate with him. Well, this time, it is the communication of the 'mental body' level. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this session, you also have two choices. One is to use skills to forcefully read each other's memories, but you must be very careful because you I can't know if the things I read are what you want to know, and if a person's huge memory is received without discrimination, it is very likely to crush your spirit, and this will seriously damage or even destroy the soul of the target. For non-professional 'psychics', I do not recommend this approach. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The second option is to gently communicate with each other's 'mental body', whether it is using rude means or using drugs, target this Time is bound to be in a state of paralysis, it is almost impossible to lie, no, you can not recall your experience! Although I know you can't remember it! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, Ms. Dai Li, I was sober at the time... Klein laughed in his heart, looking down and looking at the back of the letter:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of communication will give you a real answer, but not necessarily all the real answers. You should understand what I mean, as long as you have been exposed to journalism, I have heard the famous saying of Russell the Great. I don’t remember the specific content. The main point is to tell the truth, to tell the truth, to tell the truth, in short, the spirit does not necessarily remember everything. Because a lot of memory is in his subconscious, even in the collective subconscious, hey, I should not mention this, Dunn called it the evil theory of the psychological alchemy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, you must understand induction, be good at designing problems, do you understand? The specific skills are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The above are normal situations. For a mad, extraordinary person, what should we pay attention to when we are psychic? ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is still enough to be sensible enough, not to be a little embarrassed, because the extraordinary person is very spiritual, because the spirit of the madman is also full of confusion. Let me give you an example. The consciousness of a normal person is an island. The subconscious is the part of the island hidden under the sea. The collective subconscious is the surrounding sea. The sky belongs to the spiritual world. There is an active volcano above the 'island'. On the 'Island' of the madman, the volcano is erupting, shaking the 'bottom' and polluting the 'sea area'.
