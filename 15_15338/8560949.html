			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. X is looking for someone with bad luck? Above the fog, Klein pondered the information provided by Miss "Magic" and tried to analyze useful information from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking for a while, without inspiration, he decided to think differently, that is, to recall the people who are not lucky around him, to see if there is any inner existence. contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm...Anderson Hood, the strongest hunter in the foggy sea, counts one...Doctor Allen Chris is a...hey, they are all One of the influences of the "Snake of Destiny"... "Angel of Destiny" Uluos is one of the founders of the Redeemer Rose. This secret organization supports and believes in the "real Creator"... The Aurora will be equivalent to the "real Creator" The church... A series of situations emerged in Klein’s mind and quickly formed a conclusion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the 'destination angel' Ulous is looking for 'Silver Snake' Will. Anthony!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is driving members of the Aurora to help him find 'Silver Snake' Will. Ting! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this means that behind Mr. X, there is a king of angels somewhere in Beckland!<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, I am going to assassinate Mr. X is equal to death... No wonder Mr. X does not care about Beckland’s speciality... The official power is at most there is a saint behind him, um In the official file, the top of the Aurora meeting is only five saints, so that it will deal with the mistakes... After Klein has judged, the first idea is to push down the commission of Miss Magic, and warn The other party should not provoke Mr. X.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not the "alarm", it will involve the "Silver Snake" Will Anthony, and the extraordinary event of the Goddess Church There is a clear record of the luck of Dr. Alan Kreis in the file, and Klein wants the "Magician" to report the "destination angel" Ulos and Mr. X to a church!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmly thought for a few more seconds, with the appearance of the "world" of German Sparrow, let him In fog prayed: <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "...... I confirm the situation, give a reply tomorrow. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not directly refuse, because he intends to ask the "Silver Snake" Will Anthony!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he returned to the real world, carefully removed the already fragile paper crane from the wallet's mezzanine, and gently unfolded it.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein is not in a hurry to write the content, but first thinks about what problems need to be consulted, carefully drafted the draft, and then turned out the pencil, sharply cut with a knife.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Active under the muscles, Klein wrote: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aurora members are looking for luck Normal person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't know if you know how to make a spell with 'bugs'?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is the cord blood the blood of a mythical creature? If you count, and I want to get a drop, what is the price? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein would have liked to ask why Will Anthony was so sensible. After all, the church materials showed that there was no public belief in the "snake of destiny". But he eventually restrained himself, and Will Ansethes, who was afraid of the unborn fetus, would not answer very seriously: "When did you have the illusion of my reason?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, he didn't know whether he thought the other person was joking or telling the truth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, although there is no organization that believes in the "Snake of Destiny", the existence of "Lucky God" is still there in some areas, and it belongs to traditional customs... Perhaps they are Will Unsetin or The vest of Ulloth... Klein silently sighed a few words, exhausted the ability of the "clown", and finally folded the thousand paper cranes and put them under the pillow.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, he is free to calculate how much cash he has now.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately took a sip of water, lay down on the bed, covered with a light and warm quilt, and entered the dream a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Klein suddenly woke up and saw the ridiculous black plain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way into the dark minaret in the middle of the plain, through the chaotic layout, he came to the depths of the tower, here as usual, sprinkling a circle of towers Luo card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no silver word on the raised floor in the middle of the tarot card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will. Onsetin didn't answer... Why did you pull me into this dream? Klein was puzzled and suddenly saw a black stroller slipping out of the shadows, lying inside a baby who couldn’t see it, wrapped in silver silk! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."Mr. Snake of Destiny?" Klein asked politely and cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby then makes a clear voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you sure Mr.?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this not based on your name? Don't care about this detail! Klein whispered a few words, and relaxed a lot because of the casual attitude:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do I call you?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baby's Wil. Onsetin "Hmm", said in a distressed way:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not decided yet... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know, oh, you don't know, every time I start again, I try to make myself a little different, in order to maintain a good mental state, the child stage It should look like a child. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein heard the heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the 'monster' way to stay sane, Against crazy methods? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will. Onsetin, lying in a black pram, replied briskly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, every time you start again, you will wash away the madness. However, this still requires a certain belief position, otherwise I can't maintain the state of Sequence 1 for too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, you know more and more than before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, in addition to the belief position, there are other ways to fight against madness, but the “restart” is obviously the ability to belong to the “monster” route sequence 1 “Snake of Destiny”. Other extraordinary ways cannot be imitated... Mr. Azick Is there a sense of this in the state of constantly losing memory and constantly recovering? Klein took a thoughtful look and asked for time: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suspect that Ulobus is looking for you through the members of the Aurora." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will. Onsetin snorted: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been playing with him for a long time Hide and seek, He is not good at this kind of thing. It can be seen that he has no childhood. Every time he restarts, he grows up beside the 'real creator'. He lacks different stages of psychological state experience, which leads him to be crazy sometimes. Of course, He doesn't care.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have told Rejoed to let him use certain 'probability' in some places to leave a certain mark, this Will confuse Ulos' judgment, and he will soon leave Beckland again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, there is still a chance to assassinate Mr. X... Well, when it comes to divination under the fog, Klein does not continue. This topic, instead, asks: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know how to use the 'bugs' to make spells? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will Anthony in the stroller did not answer directly, and asked a question:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Where did you get the 'bugs from time' from Pales Soloas? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
