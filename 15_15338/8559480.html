			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the upward movement of the line of sight, Klein roughly observed the owner of the footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a lady, wearing a pair of beige trousers that are easy to move, wearing a pair of short black leather boots, but the upper body is covered with a light brown The knee-length skirt, the skirt is slanting and scattered, showing a bit of unsatisfactory and chic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of wearing and matching instantly gives Klein a feeling of returning to the earth, because whether it is Lun, or Intis, or even Fossac, Fenerbo Special countries such as Te, Rumburg, Ma Xi, and East and West, have not popularized similar styles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked up faster and finally saw the opposite lady:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has The chestnut long hair that is naturally covered with the head, the straight eyebrows are just right, the eyes are blue and deep, as if condensed a sea. She has outstanding beauty, but it is not the most eye-catching but not the point. Even more impressive, Klein even wants to bury his head and avoid the line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she is very tall, and my state is similar to Klein Moretti... Klein has made up for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thoroughly digesting the "No Face" potion, he increasingly realized that the self is a combination of personality, experience, cognition and various interpersonal relationships, appearance and The figure is a type that can be changed at will, so as long as you clearly know who you are, he does not mind using the word "state" to describe the physical characteristics of each previous identity. Any change in "no face" can be Fixed, no need for extra maintenance, that is, even if there is no corresponding extraordinary ability, he can still maintain the shape of German Sparrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, he can completely make Klein Moretti really grow taller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒,哒,哒, the lady who gave the look down step by step to the opposite of Klein, opened the chair and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We met again." The lady said in a soft but uninteresting tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way this voice speaks, some familiar... Klein’s flash of light flashes the source of familiarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene from the other side immediately echoed in his mind, and finally settled in the black leather boots! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...is her! Klein Horan recalled the relevant scene: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sneaked into the Kingdom Museum in a spiritual state, and took the "Black Emperor" card when he met a person at the scene. Demigod, the other side sits on the top of the wooden staircase between the tall bookshelves, the feet wearing black leather boots hang down, hanging in the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He changed back to Sherlock. Moriarty, after being chased by the devil dog, he met the green pea vines on the way. The forest road, forced to follow the carriage, all the way to the air, saw a hammock-like seat with a pea-vine and a pair of black leather boots! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s her! How could she appear in this dream world and appear in this sea area? Moreover, and also said that "again" met, I am now Gelman Sparrow! Between the thoughts, Klein responded indifferently to each other:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have not seen each other before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the demigod? As long as it is not an angel, in this dream world, I can use the "Poseidon Scepter" to fight against one or two! Klein silently sighed at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman with long eyebrows sits opposite, slightly lifts her chin and stares at Klein for two seconds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? Grand Theft Auto 'Mr. Black Emperor'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang, Klein’s thoughts are like being directly hit by the Thunder , fried into countless small pieces, messy, mixed, can not find the focus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She recognized that I was the spirit that stole the card in the Kingdom Museum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, how is this possible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, why does she directly call me the Grand Theft Auto "Black Emperor", if I change to "Sherlock. Moriarty", I will be even more shocked, even difficult Concealing the change of expression...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One by one thought flashed, Klein instinctively controlled the muscles of the face, calmly said:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand what you are talking about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady who wears something different from the current trend style does not repeat her own words. I did not explain anything, but instead said in a flat and straightforward tone: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the identity of Gilman Sparo, which I provide." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Klein’s scalp is numb, and he feels that he has no secret in front of the other person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German.Sparo is the identity that Miss Sharon has forged through her channel... This lady is her channel? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, Miss Sharon mentioned that some of her circles are investigating the true identity of the Grand Theft Auto "Black Emperor" and promised to meet the reasonable requirements of the Completion. The material limitation is the high sequence below...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Miss Sharon’s description, the principal’s image is more than 1 meter, the body proportion is very good, and the chestnut color is long. Hair, love to wear black leather boots, hey, isn't that the opposite?... I suspected that she was the half-god I met in the Kingdom Museum, and she knew that I was taking the "Black Emperor." "牌......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thought flashed quickly, and Klein didn't know how to speak for a short time, so he had to keep silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman whose chin is not sharp and has a slight curvature does not continue the problem of the identity of German Spalo, and looks at the dusk-like road outside the eyes: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nast Solomon's 'Black Emperor' also appeared in the sea during your time in the Rothde Islands.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think you should know what it means, Grand Theft Auto. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the other party not only revealed his identity, but also gave ideas and evidence, Klein had to move his mouth:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The extraordinary feature aggregation law. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of the woman opposite him was softened a bit, as if with a little smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You really are Grand Theft Auto 'Black Emperor'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......I don't know for sure...you just listed the clues and showed a confident attitude... How could she be so sure? She also There is no evidence to show it? Klein was annoyed and confused.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-time high-ranking lady did not say so much, looking to the bookshelf: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You found out through his diary that the bookmark was a 'black emperor' brand? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diary... This lady also knows that the so-called Russell notes are diaries... Klein stunned and did not answer.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't take the note just because you noticed something?" "The lady asked again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...Kline suddenly wanted to understand something, decided not to ask questions, and made himself no longer passive, no longer He can only follow the rhythm of the other party.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks at the opposite lady’s deep blue eyes and speaks directly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the mysterious person who secretly peeped at me on the 'future'? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful but incomprehensible lady replied bluntly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this period of observation, combined with the previous information, she can basically be sure that I am a "no face" and a "magician"... From her tone, she and the "star above" are very familiar... The top of the "Moss Assassination Society", or the "mysterious queen"? Klein clicked on the head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady lifted again Chin, the corner of the mouth is slightly squished:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The normal 'clown', there is no such a dangerous premonition, even if it has sequence 5."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was discovered by her a little special...this...what she knows about the "Divination" approach... Sure enough, it has a little influence on the power of the fog, Can I have an intuitive premonition in a non-hazardous situation? Klein didn't give the other person a chance to speak again. He asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anderson Hood heard the opening of the door and the footsteps in the depths of the mural hall. Belong to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean the doom-ridden hunter?" the opposite lady asked thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Klein nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really me." The opposite woman paused for a second, "telling the hunter a prophecy, the most deadly danger is often hidden in the most common life." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean? Klein saw the other side's unexplained meaning, and asked and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The person who made me appear in the dream of the "Black Saint" is you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite woman has a long, maroon hair, and the voice is soft but indifferent:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's not hard to guess.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After this dream, I confirm that you took the relics of the captive sea snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also appeared in a spirited state like the last time, taking the item in front of Yann Courtman and disappearing directly? Well, you still carry The 'Black Emperor' card."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not respond to this topic and instead asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You are the 'mysterious queen'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot of people call me that." The opposite woman's expression answered plainly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really... This lady’s bounty is as high as 650,000 pounds, only one country in Lun! Klein silently took a breath: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. What are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The "Mysterious Queen" watched him for a few seconds with a blue eyes, and then said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that you will create the words that Russell's own creation. The way of interpretation is shared with me, I can satisfy most of your requirements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not admit it and did not deny it, hehe smiled: < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you give me the corresponding high-sequence potion formula?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mysterious Queen" The momentum is restrained but the temperament is watching him: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your destiny is the main peak of the Hornaces."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... Klein is shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his eyes and thought about the problem, the "mysterious queen" stood up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “When you need some help or a few clues to the 'Big Card', tell me the answer.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned and leaned towards the clean and spacious library Going deep, one step, two steps, the figure is getting weaker and lighter, and disappears quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
