			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon wearing a black court dress slightly licked the bloodless lips, looked at Maric at the side and gently clicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric’s hands clasped, hiding a little madness: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You should know’ prisoners 'Pathway?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I heard about it in extraordinary circles." Klein calmly replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this extraordinary circle refers to the night team and the Tarot... He sighed in his heart and added a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric did not know what was recalled, silenced for more than a dozen seconds, and the sound of the horse wheel rolling over the concrete road was transmitted rhythmically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked his messy brown hair and his face opened slightly twisted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Prisoners refer to those who are locked up in prison, and the oppressors whose spirituality and desire are bound by reason, body, and the world. The extraordinary people in this sequence are strong, sensitive, and often have a silent appearance and crazy. I have a lot of criminal skills in my heart, and I am good at killing anyone with anything I can get."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It corresponds to the sequence 8 called 'crazy', I miss you and It’s not clear, because even the orthodox extraordinary institutions of the Seven Great Churches don’t know enough about them. The secret organization’s mastery of the members is beyond your imagination. Those who are almost distorted, like the body and the soul, are like being tied. It’s hard to get useful information from them simply by psychic and divination.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I and Sharon have been patient for a long time, waiting for a long time before I found Understand the method of 'binding', successfully escape "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the extraordinary people in this path have the characteristics of being cursed and mad, we don't want to trust the seven churches, it will completely lose freedom, a little There is no more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out to be the case... No wonder the contents of the internal data recorded by the night are not many, even the sequence 8 and sequence 7 corresponding to the "Prisoner" None, this is part of what I was able to know at the time... Klein replied in vain: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really don't know what happened after 'Prisoner' "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric nodded, looking at Klein with a brown eye, continued: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Compared with the 'Prisoner', the biggest characteristic of the 'madman' is that he can sacrifice his own reason and initiative, and explode his desires, in exchange for strength, and all aspects of improvement, except that the mind will become less awake during that time. There are not too many problems, and even the extraordinary thoughts that affect the spirit The powerful resistance of force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, I will kill myself first, you can't kill me anymore...Klein can't help it. Abdominal swearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From this sequence, the curse gradually appeared, and the ‘madman’ was easily out of control.” Maric’s face twitched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn’t this obvious? If a person's mental state is running low in the long run, or frequent abnormalities, the probability of losing control is not higher than other extraordinary people! Klein had his own understanding of this, and looked at Miss Sharon sideways and felt that it was difficult for him to imagine the appearance of the "Prisoner" and "Crazy" stages, and Sharon still maintained the kind of ghostly swaying. status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric saw that he did not say anything, and slowly vomited: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sequence 7 is, 'Werewolf'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting dissimilation? However, the "prisoner" in front of the heart and the "madman" who is easy to lose reason are in fact similar to the aliens in the eyes of ordinary people... Well, "Werewolf" actually sequenced 7, which is lower than I expected... Klein The thoughts suddenly spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric didn't realize that he was embarrassed and said to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Wolfman' Already a complete cursed person, every time the red moon is rounded, most of the reason will be lost, and the black hair will grow, and the killing and bloodthirsty desires will reach its peak..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice gradually became erratic, and it seemed to recall the experience of suffering and patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The werewolf has a strong self-recovery ability, as well as the power, agility and speed of terror. His hands and teeth are not worse than the extraordinary weapons of the same sequence. He also knows some dark spells, such as controlling the target of being immersed in the body by the werewolf for a period of time, and transforming the other into a subordinate, turning into a monster like a werewolf, and the life of the monster is often very Short..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Maric, Klein made a pertinent evaluation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At the level of Sequence 7, in terms of actual combat ability, "Werewolf" is considered moderate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'wolfwolves' who are unable to suppress the killing and bloodthirsty desires on the full moon night will become more and more cold, more and more distorted, and gradually lose normal humans. Some feelings." Maric added, a little bit of pride in the tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Mr. Azke’s description of the different species... Klein subconsciously looked at Miss Sharon’s instinct and instinctively imagined the state of the other’s “wolfman” The result was almost chilled by the cold eyes, and he hurriedly turned back to his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric unconsciously licked his lower lip with his tongue, not the kind of female temptation, but the type that gives people a very dangerous feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze seems to have lost focus for a short time, I don’t know what to think back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, he reopened:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the corresponding sequence 6, 'Live corpse'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live corps...The appearance is really like... It’s no wonder that often playing with a bunch of similar cards... It turns out to be a different kind, really alive. The dead body... Klein thought about it: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard Casper said, you are not afraid of bullets?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric nodded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My body can be as hard as steel, even if you use a revolver against me The brain is emitting, and I also have the most dizziness. It is possible to break my defense by hitting the same position at least five times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And even if it breaks, For 'live corpse', as long as the head is not broken, other injuries are not fatal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My strength is based on the 'wolfman' Certainly improved, and mastered some death-like spells It is easy to wake up dead bodies, control ghosts, drive them, and skillfully use the power of cold and decay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heterogeneous pathway is also characteristic of each sequence. Not the same, the progressive changes are rare... Klein has indulged in the following: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, the curse of the 'living corpse'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric bites the lower teeth very little:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will long for human warmth Blood and fresh flesh and blood, this state is especially serious at the full moon. The only thing that is gratifying is that the curse of 'live corpse' replaces the curse of the 'wolf' and the curse of 'the madman'. They don't exist at the same time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whenever the red moon is rounded, I will be very painful. If I don't give up my self-control, I will be painful to lose the ability to fight, and if I indulge myself, It will also become less and less like human beings, and the risk of getting out of control is high."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even even in normal times I also moments against the desire of the heart, against a strong malice. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, compared to the extraordinary people in this way, the others are much better, except for the 'Abyss' and 'Witches'... Klein Out of this idea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maric paused and glanced at Sharon wearing a black cap and a soft cap.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon opens his lips, and his voice says illusory:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sequence 5, 'Resentment'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resentment? And this sequence? It really is a different way... Klein was slightly surprised, and immediately thought it was in line with the physical and spiritual Features that can be easily converted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
