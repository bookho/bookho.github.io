			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the greetings of Miss Justice, the "hidden" Jia Delia, as before, kept a calm and spectator attitude, without excessive investment, it still seems to be The outsider of this party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Miss "Justice" and "Magician" each took out the Russell Diary, repaid the debts owed before, and then did not dare Carefully aiming at the "fool" Mr., but still can not see through the strange gray fog, the dark purple eye can only reflect the clothes that are absolutely ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the three pages of Russell’s diary, Klein didn’t wait to read as usual, after all, he had touched and used the “0” seal. I saw the "uniqueness" of an extraordinary path and what it looked like, and effectively intimidated this artifact. I thought that it would be difficult for him to be too shocked, no matter what Russell the Great wrote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless he was given a 'wow blessing' by a powerful individual, he became a woman for a short time..." Klein made a joke in his heart, interested The place looked around the bronze long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咦, Ms. "Hidden" Ms. Curious and "Justice" Miss They are not the same. Do you seem to pay special attention to the Russell Diary? Klein took back his gaze, took note of the findings, and then read the yellow-brown parchment in his hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"April 22, We are going to enter there and explore the abyss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On April 23, we walked through the dark ocean, through the liquid mist, and arrived at that kind Like a monster's mountain, behind it is a boundless black mist, they seem to cover a continent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, if you go to the bottom of the mountain, but it will I felt that there was no end, there was no limit. I jokingly told Edwards that if I jumped here and jumped on the cliff, I might never fall to the ground, but I would always fall. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Klein almost frowned. It is hard to believe that Russell, after seeing the abyss, dared to organize his own knights and sailors to explore the border." Region.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is not afraid of death? It is rumored that it is a place that will corrode everything and let all the souls fall! At this stage, Russell certainly did not reach sequence 4, not half-god, at most 5, and maybe not yet... change it to me, definitely turn the bow immediately, report to the church..." This moment, Klein once again Deeply aware of how great the difference between myself and Russell is.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Russell’s description of the “abyss” boundary reminds Klein of Amon The mysterious stone gate in the mausoleum, which appeared in a similar picture after the steam touched the "Doll" of the mechanical church Archbishop Horamick.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what Russell will find there... At least he didn't die because of this exploration, and he still lived very well... Klein moved down and read the rest of the diary of this page:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On April 24th, we went down the mountain and tried to go deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The black fog is cold and smooth, as if it can soak the flesh and soul, haha, fortunately, certain items on the Black Throne can effectively resist this Corrosion, otherwise I suspect that both me and my apocalypse knights will become members of the Flange Dance Group. (Note 1)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is very quiet, We have not found anything. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On April 25th, we saw the devil, but they only had decaying bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behind the black rock of the scorpion, it is difficult to call it under the mud of the road, and there are different devil bodies in various or normal or unimaginable places.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They seem to have suffered the same death at the same time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On April 26, either the body, or the silence, there is never an end in the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The items in the Black Throne began to show signs of corrosion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My recent years I have rarely felt scared, but here, the unknown fear is like an invisible hand, pinching my heart tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened after that? Did Russell Greatly escape the abyssal border very smoothly, or did he encounter something else? What does the change there mean? A fierce war? Klein turned to the second page with a subconscious expectation, and regretted that there was no contact before and after: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May 8th, my lovely Bernard When I was two years old, the longer I was, the more lovable, the young girl who inherited the excellent genes of me and her mother.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to her crisply Dad, looking at her lively figure, I suddenly felt a kind of satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since crossing the world, I have done a lot of things, and some can even say that I can’t see people, but I don’t feel ashamed and I don’t regret it. The reason is because I am a person who is hard to restrain my desires and is easily affected by the surrounding environment. Oh, I must thank the fate. I have never encountered the 'desire apostle' of the 'demon' route. Otherwise, according to the records of the information, I must be The extraordinary person of this sequence is quite restrained and may even suffer spikes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the other hand, I still have a sense of alienation from the world, my life. My father and mother are very good to me. I also try to make them proud. However, I know that my feelings for them are very weak. Similarly, this is my feeling for Matilda, and possessiveness is more than affection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I have to admit that my mentality is like playing a virtual reality role-playing game. Parents, wives, brothers, friends are just NPCs, you can bet A little bit of emotion, but it won't really be in my heart, so I can participate in all kinds of fallen parties without any embarrassment. I can deal with the acquaintances once and for all, just like when I was playing in ancient times, I could kill a village for a chicken. The same.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But Bernardie was born, I found that I have a little more sense of belonging to the world, no longer so alienated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my child, a living child.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe this is called maturity ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without children, I can't understand this feeling, no, not even my girlfriend...but the mentality mentioned in the diary of the Great, I also have Be vigilant... It doesn't exist before, it doesn't mean it won't appear in the future. The higher the sequence, the more divine than the humanity... Kline silently sighed two sentences and turned to the third page diary:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"January 6, the new year, a new beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After "promoting the craftsman", I finally have the ability to do that!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That is the mysterious silver medal in my memory. The big probability is that it caused me to cross! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, after becoming a 'common person', I have completely recalled its appearance, recalling the strange symbols and patterns on its surface, but that At the time, I can clearly perceive that I can't imitate similar items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On January 9th, after several failures, I finally succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With this silver medal full of strange symbols and patterns, I tried to infuse spirituality and try to inspire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that there is a boundless gray mist in front of me, but nothing happened after that.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The reason for the material, or the lack of necessary steps? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On January 10th, I reverted to the state of the past in retrospect, and I thought I was no longer missing, but the mysterious The silver medal still only allows me to see the weird fog and can't help me with anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this doesn't work, how did I succeed in the first place?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I temporarily give up I tried to destroy the silver medal I made. Maybe after I became a high-ranking strongman, after I became a demigod, I would have a way to interpret the meaning of those patterns and symbols and figure out the mystery of crossing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I am sure to be a demigod! I am the protagonist of this era!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
