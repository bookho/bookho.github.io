			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday evening, 8 o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein arrived in the home of Mr. Maht, 39 Burk Lund Street, in his own high-end carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sound of the fountain pool reflecting the lights, he buckled the button of the swallowtail dress, walked down the carriage, and slowly walked to the main entrance of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richardson is holding a bottle of beautifully decorated Southville wine, immediately behind the employer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the door, Klein saw Ms. Mori Maht and his wife, Ms. Liana, at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is wearing an olive-green army uniform, wearing an orange-red ankle strap and several medals on the chest - in the kingdom of Lun, active or retired Military officers like to wear military uniforms during the dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter is a yellow non-standing collar long skirt with a ruffled edge on it, rare delicate lace, different from unmarried ladies, but it also shows whiteness Neck and half shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the bottle of Nanwell red wine from the personal maid Richardson and handed it to Mr. Maht, then prayed:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, a few minutes late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually a common situation at the Lun Banquet, guests prefer If you are late for a certain period of time, you can't arrive early, because the host may still be busy preparing for the final banquet. This time is not suitable for entertaining guests. Of course, it is as close as possible to ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Wahana to teach this common sense, Klein would definitely politely come back a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, the dance hasn't officially started yet." Mahett glanced at the Nanwell red wine in his hand and handed it to his close-fitting servant. Smiling and nodding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the high-end social scene of Lun, the first time to participate in the banquet held by the other party, you must send the owner a small gift, of which the most popular alcoholic drinks, but It must be remembered that the first time we have to choose domestically produced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the male owner greeting, Klein looked at Mrs. Liana again, saw her slightly raised her right hand, so she stepped forward and held her palm , bent over and kissed a bit: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your light illuminates the entire dance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Before the banquet, the compliment to the owner is a rare place in Lun’s social occasions that does not need to be subtle. Unlike Intis, Lun’s kiss must be made by the woman first, and the man can Underneath, otherwise it is a serious rude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The same is true of your arrival." Mrs. Liana replied with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the couple led Dawn. Dontes crossed the porch and entered the hall, and the melodious melody had already echoed here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few steps forward, Morrie Macht pointed to a girl wearing a sky-blue dress:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My daughter, Hailuer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the girl and the light suddenly shrank! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows this girl! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurately, he has seen each other’s image! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked Arrods where he could get magical items that could steal other people’s extraordinary abilities. The proud girl of the sewer, and this is Hailuer Maht, a young lady with long dark hair and dark brown eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has the magical item corresponding to "The Pirates of Fire"? How can she fall into the sewer under her family conditions? Is that an adventure that belongs to her? What is she looking for in the sewer or waiting for? Has she become an extraordinary person? How to become an extraordinary person? Is there a grandfather in her body? Will the old grandfather be able to detect the smell of fog like Amon, the god of the gods? Klein, who is dressed in Dawn. Dontes's "skin", immediately thinks of a lot of problems, but the face is quietly and rudely:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, he quietly swept the eyes of Hairouer Macht and found that the girl's expression was dull, her eyes were proud, and she smiled with a courtesy smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Good evening, Mr. Don Tae."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has no abnormal reaction, which means that at least she is not aware of the fog... as for her There was no grandfather's parasitic, and it was still uncertain. I have to continue to observe... Kline raised his body and took a glass of pale gold champagne from the tray next to the waiter and talked to Mr. Murray Maht: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to be a major."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the epaulette from Mr. Maht Look out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other party is a colonel, Klein will doubt that this gentleman is also extraordinary, but the major is hard to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, this is nothing, there is too much opportunity to build merit in East Byron." Mori Maht replied modestly, "Of course, there The climate is also very uncomfortable. I have been advising the upper level of the army, designing special military uniforms for East and West, and removing the traditional dark colors, otherwise the officers will feel like beef on the grill."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the soldiers, they are mostly red and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the climate there is completely different from that in the country, even the Desi Bay is not so hot." Klein seems to have no way to show that he is going After passing through the Southland, I went to one of the things and worships, and confirmed the hunting experience with a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few minutes of chilling, Mr. Maht apologized and took his wife, Liana, to the stairs and went up to the second floor, facing the gate. At the fence, raise the cup with red wine:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for participating in this dance. First, let us praise the gods. This is all good. Source."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Mrs. Liana immediately clicked on the chest, whispering the goddess, and the guests also praised themselves in a corresponding way. The god of faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Maht still holds the cup, does not let go, continues with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Secondly, praise the kingdom, this is the cornerstone of stability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Praise the kingdom." Klein raised the glass of champagne, and said to the surrounding guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Mr. Maht looked around and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last, we What do you like to praise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought, and laughed loudly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like Baker Rand’s air is getting better.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Maht stunned and couldn’t contain a smile and responded with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Very good, this proposal is very good.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us praise Beckland's air for improvement, this is a symbol of our better life, cheers! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treatment of air pollution is the political philosophy of his lower house of parliament. He has always promoted the development of the corresponding bills on various occasions and played a role in environmental improvement." It’s no small role, so praising Beckland’s air is better than praising him, and it’s more subtle and brighter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guests responded enthusiastically He drank the alcoholic drink in his hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Mr. Maht took the hand of Mrs. Liana and went down to the lobby on the first floor. The soft melody jumped into the opening dance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men present started looking for the partner they wanted the first invitation, and Klein regained a glass of champagne. Take a leisurely look at the guests.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
