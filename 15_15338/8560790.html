			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday evening, 8 o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein arrived in the home of Mr. Maht, 39 Burk Lund Street, in his own high-end carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sound of the fountain pool reflecting the lights, he buckled the button of the swallowtail dress, walked down the carriage, and slowly walked to the main entrance of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richardson is holding a bottle of beautifully decorated Southville wine, immediately behind the employer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the door, Klein saw Ms. Mori Maht and his wife, Ms. Liana, at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is wearing an olive-green army uniform, wearing an orange-red ankle strap and several medals on the chest - in the kingdom of Lun, active or retired Military officers like to wear military uniforms during the dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter is a yellow non-standing collar long skirt with a ruffled edge on it, rare delicate lace, different from unmarried ladies, but it also shows whiteness Neck and half shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein took the bottle of Nanwell red wine from the personal maid Richardson and handed it to Mr. Maht, then prayed:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, a few minutes late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually a common situation at the Lun Banquet, guests prefer If you are late for a certain period of time, you can't arrive early, because the host may still be busy preparing for the final banquet. This time is not suitable for entertaining guests. Of course, it is as close as possible to ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Wahana to teach this common sense, Klein would definitely politely come back a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, the dance hasn't officially started yet." Mahett glanced at the Nanwell red wine in his hand and handed it to his close-fitting servant. Smiling and nodding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the high-end social scene of Lun, the first time to participate in the banquet held by the other party, you must send the owner a small gift, of which the most popular alcoholic drinks, but It must be remembered that the first time we have to choose domestically produced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After greeting the male owner, Klein looked at Mrs. Liana again and saw her slightly raised her right hand, so she stepped forward and held her palm, bent over and kissed her: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your light illuminates the entire dance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the banquet begins, the compliment to the host is in the social scene of Lun Rarely does not need to be subtle, and unlike Intis, Lun's kiss hand must be made by the woman, the man can proceed, otherwise it is a serious rude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The same is true of your arrival." Mrs. Liana replied with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the couple led Dawn. Dontes crossed the porch and entered the hall, and the melodious melody had already echoed here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few steps forward, Morrie Macht pointed to a girl wearing a sky-blue dress:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My daughter, Hailuer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein looked at the girl and the light suddenly shrank! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows this girl! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurately, he has seen each other’s image! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked Arrods where he could get magical items that could steal other people’s extraordinary abilities. The proud girl of the sewer, and this is Hailuer Maht, a young lady with long dark hair and dark brown eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has the magical item corresponding to "The Pirates of Fire"? How can she fall into the sewer under her family conditions? Is that an adventure that belongs to her? What is she looking for in the sewer or waiting for? Has she become an extraordinary person? How to become an extraordinary person? Is there a grandfather in her body? Will the old grandfather be able to detect the smell of fog like Amon, the god of the gods? Klein, who is dressed in Dawn. Dontes's "skin", immediately thinks of a lot of problems, but on the surface, he does not swear by the chest: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ok, Miss Hayer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, he quietly swept the eyes of Hairouer Macht and found that the girl's expression was dull, her eyes were proud, and she smiled with a courtesy smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Good evening, Mr. Don Tae."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has no abnormal reaction, which means that at least she is not aware of the fog... as for her There was no grandfather's parasitic, and it was still uncertain. I have to continue to observe... Kline raised his body and took a glass of pale gold champagne from the tray next to the waiter and talked to Mr. Murray Maht: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to be a major."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the epaulette from Mr. Maht Look out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other party is a colonel, Klein will doubt that this gentleman is also extraordinary, but the major is hard to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, this is nothing, there is too much opportunity to build merit in East Byron." Mori Maht replied modestly, "Of course, there The climate is also very uncomfortable. I have been advising the upper level of the army, designing special military uniforms for East and West, and removing the traditional dark colors, otherwise the officers will feel like beef on the grill."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the soldiers, they are mostly red and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the climate there is completely different from that in the country, even the Desi Bay is not so hot." Klein seems to have no way to show that he is going After passing through the Southland, I went to one of the things and worships, and confirmed the hunting experience with a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few minutes of chilling, Mr. Maht apologized and took his wife, Liana, to the stairs and went up to the second floor, facing the gate. At the fence, raise the cup with red wine:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for participating in this dance. First, let us praise the gods. This is all good. Source."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Mrs. Liana immediately clicked on the chest, whispering the goddess, and the guests also praised themselves in a corresponding way. The god of faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Maht still holds the cup, does not let go, continues with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Secondly, praise the kingdom, this is the cornerstone of stability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Praise the kingdom." Klein raised the glass of champagne, and said to the surrounding guests. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Mr. Maht looked around and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last, we What do you like to praise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein thought, and laughed loudly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like Baker Rand’s air is getting better.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Maht stunned and couldn’t contain a smile and responded with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Very good, this proposal is very good.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us praise Beckland's air for improvement, this is a symbol of our better life, cheers! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treatment of air pollution is the political philosophy of his lower house of parliament. He has always promoted the development of the corresponding bills on various occasions and played a role in environmental improvement." It’s no small role, so praising Beckland’s air is better than praising him, and it’s more subtle and brighter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guests responded enthusiastically He drank the alcoholic drink in his hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Mr. Maht took the hand of Mrs. Liana and went down to the lobby on the first floor. The soft melody jumped into the opening dance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men present started looking for the partner they wanted the first invitation, and Klein regained a glass of champagne. I took a leisurely look at the guests.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咦, Mrs. Mary is also here... He swept over and found an acquaintance: the majority shareholder of Coim. Tens of thousands of pounds, Mrs. Mary, who had commissioned Sherlock Moratti to rape.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She It’s a member of the Air Pollution Investigation Committee, and it’s normal to get close to the next member who supports this... Klein didn’t try to invite the other person to dance because he’s now Dawne Dontes, who doesn’t even know the neighborhood. Lady.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He regained his gaze and looked at other places. He saw Hailuer. Maht carrying a glass of white wine, standing on the edge of the edge, with a slightly alienated smile, watching the men lock their objects and prepare to dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady looks very good, very atmospheric and feminine, it should be the star of the dance, everyone is vying to invite the object of dancing, but she is carrying The arrogant attitude of condescending, let a man who turned his attention to her have shifted their goals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of look, I have seen it in some extraordinary people, they think that it is not a common custom, when faced with ordinary people, there will be a strong sense of superiority... ...hehe, this shows that the great probability of Miss Hailuer is extraordinary. Also, if it is not an extraordinary person, how dare she squat in the sewer... Is she a "stealer" way? However, how does this arrogant look like "the thief" and "fraudster"? It's hard to imagine... Klein sees the opening dance of the couple's husband and wife coming to an end, and he begins to seriously consider which lady to invite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn. Dontes is in his early forties, and the first dance invites a girl, not very appropriate, unless it is a definite junior, and the husband’s A dance should be given to her husband... Well, the familiar person or the owner of the ball should be invited... Klein’s gaze sweeps the dance floor, only to find a lady who is familiar to Dawn. Etiquette teacher Vahana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invite her? No, before the secret help, she should already know that when she invites her to dance the first dance, it is easy for her to misunderstand, which may affect the relationship between her husband and wife, and give the identity of Daun Dontes. There are many unnecessary troubles... I am not a great emperor, I like a wife, no, he has a hobby. In short, the suspicion has to avoid suspicion... Klein’s sight shifts, the music has changed, and it has become soft. brisk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a popular music in the middle of the village of Lun, loved by the nobility, often used to match the first dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the changes in the melody, the men went to the selected lady or lady, and Klein noticed that no one went to Hailuer. near. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is one of the masters of the ball...and can take a closer look...hehe, if she is really the "stealer" path, it means gray The fog has a certain "cohesion" on the similar approach of "the divination"... Kline, with a gentle smile, unhurriedly walked toward the proud girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
