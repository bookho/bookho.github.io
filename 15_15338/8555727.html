			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West District, 9 Hope Street, Prime Minister's official residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agusid Nigan stood behind a large table and looked at the opposite Earl of Hall:#br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Secretary, my secretary should have told you what happened, you are the first aristocrat I thought of at this moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The Conservative Party is a big-name, the current Prime Minister of the Cabinet. It’s a few years old. The tall and thin figure seems to be somewhat unbearable and slightly tilted forward, so that it is necessary to hold the table with both hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his eyes are still sharp and his attitude is still calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hall Earl, who has two beautiful moustaches, sighs:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very shocked by this news. I am thinking of visiting the Duke in recent days to discuss the bills that we are all concerned about. Who knows that he has been attacked..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was deeply sorrowful, grief and empathy when he was ruined by the deep decrees and blessings. He then convinced his emotions:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Duke of the Lord has died. We need to be more cautious and calm than weeping and anger. Only in this way can we handle the follow-up and prevent the kingdom from carrying a heavy steam train out of orbit."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is why I was looking for you in the first place. Other nobles will only shout the gods, fear of being trembling, and said that they are unacceptable. They are required to immediately punish the murderer and find behind the scenes. The ambassador, in their view, the Duke under heavy protection will be assassinated, not to mention "Ahemiah Prime Minister Shen Sheng said, "This is a very normal and understandable reaction, but it is not the reaction we need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hall The count turned his head and asked: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the murderer? What is the motivation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "A demon disguised as a banker for more than a decade, the real devil, yes, your Bavut Bank has just acquired his estate." Aguchi German gas stated nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Patrick Jason?" Earl Hall immediately remembered the other's name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This acquisition involving the bank was approved by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Agusid did not blame the other party, thinking and saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has sequence 5 However, he suddenly sold the industry, discarded the identity that had been in business for more than a decade, and risked the assassination of my brother. According to this, we can make a strong guess that he was instructed by someone or a certain force. It is a pity that he was killed on the way to escape, and even the spirits were taken away. According to the night reporter, it was the Grand Thefter 'Black Emperor'."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Involved in an extremely secret organization, and we can't find out about it in a short time?" Earl asked one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the trace of the so-called Grand Theft Auto has not been left. We can only start with people who have contacted Jason in the past few months. It will take a lot of time and may not have results.” Agusid gave a definite answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Hall has taken two steps:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the attitude of His Majesty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sad, but no specific thoughts." Agusid replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hall Earl frowned and thought:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this case, the important thing is no longer Who is behind the scenes, but what we want to achieve by this matter, if you want war, want to restart the colonial battle, then tell the people, instruct Patrick Jason to be the Fossac Empire, and give them Compiling a detailed process and showing some evidence that seems to be the case. In the past hundreds of thousands of years, our neighbor in the north has always played a similar role. I think everyone should be used to it, no doubt. It is very, very, very normal for barbarians to do this kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the people are afraid of them." Prime Minister Aguhid’s no smile I’m going to make a series of changes. We are going to make a series of changes, and we will be able to stabilize in the second half of next year and have the ability to wage war.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl Hall said indulgently: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is to find an object that everyone can accept, Grand Theft Auto 'Black Emperor' is too mysterious, the hidden organization behind him is So, if you publish it in this way, it will definitely cause great panic. People are always afraid of things that are not known enough.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, 'Aurora" how about it? They had assassinated the sex madness of Intis a few months ago, and it was not surprising to do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their reputation is bad enough, their situation has been repeated several times in newspapers and magazines, and even became the horror element and classic villain of many novels, and, This can effectively dispel other people's doubts about us. Some people think that the previous assassination was done by us to entrust the 'Aurora'.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organize the opportunity of illegal organization, clean up Beckland, and hide too many dangerous guys here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agusid "Hmm": "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Aurora" is a good Objects...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, aim at them, and wait until next year, we are ready, and then publish the results of the investigation, accusing the drive of the 'Aurora' is Fossa The empire, I don’t think anyone would care about the excuses of terrorist organizations and northern barbarians.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Hall stunned:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a step further than my thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aguhid no longer said, stand up straight:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to meet with His Majesty now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said here, he looked at Earl of Hall At a glance: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to pay attention to safety. We haven't figured out the motives of the gang to assassinate my brother. Hey, the Storm Church has agreed to replace the Beckland Parish. Archbishop, Sneek is always late at a critical time The believers in the storm are always so violent, irritable, stubborn, arrogant, and easily mobilized!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not have prejudice, such as Luermi It’s very wise.” Earl Hall first smirked and immediately clicked on his chest. “Thank you, the goddess will bless me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twilight Hermit... It sounds very powerful..." Klein, who returned to the real world, got up and pressed the mechanical button of the toilet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sound of flowing water, he walked out of the bathroom and thought about the information he had obtained from the "Psychic". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suspects that the "Twilight Hermit" is the ancient organization with the second slate that Russell joined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the so-called historical process, choosing to find someone to assassinate the Duke of Nigan, it sounds ridiculous, but it seems to make sense... their goal is to resurrection or Said to wake up the original Creator? This is somewhat close to the idea of ​​Silver City. The little "sun" never believes that the Lord who created everything has passed away. He only accepts the idea that he abandoned the area and has been trying to get a response... Klein paced back and forth and dispersed himself. Thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, he suddenly heard the sound of knocking on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside is not the waiter or maid of the Cragg Club, but a member of the "Mechanical Heart" that Klein had seen before, Carlson wearing heavy glasses . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you get in?" Klein asked, deliberately blurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson sees that he is indeed in the room, his expression is obviously relaxed, seeing no one around, smirking and laughing:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As an extraordinary person, there are always various ways."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He received the deacon from Iconser The news, knowing the death of the "desire apostle", and then confirming my situation, and my performance is still successful, "big change" is not exposed, successfully concealed the past... Kline's heart micro-motion: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your expression tells me, is there good news?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Patrick Jason Beria has been killed, you are safe, no need to accept our protection." Carlson said truthfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such feedback, Klein felt that the potion in the body seemed to speed up the digestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked in amazement and joy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"OK?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"OK." Carlson gave a positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is great!" Klein said with delight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlson glanced at him and said with sincerity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your detective intuition and logic Thinking gave us the most important help. The deacon said in the letter that after the event, you will be given a bounty, about 1,000 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1000 pounds... ...not bad, very generous! However, even if the banknotes under the Jason suitcase are 5 pounds, the type of 1 pound denomination, even if his jewelry is not too expensive, the total is almost 50,000 pounds... Mary of the Air Pollution Investigation Committee Madame, counting the value of Coim’s shares, and at most such a net worth...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Jason’s draped human skin is responsible for the “God” Most of the singers' accomplices have taken away some of them. The rest is estimated to be 20,000 to 30,000 pounds, but this is still unmatched by 1,000 pounds. It is really regrettable... I can’t think so, maybe Jason’s accomplices took them in advance. All the belongings... Klein lost a burst of joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "Mechanical Heart" rewards the bounty more proving the success of his performance during this time, let him feel that his distance completely digested the "magician" There is only one step left in the potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what I should do. After all, the person being threatened is me." Klein piled up with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not worried that Jason’s associates will retaliate, because this revenge is only a blind man, and more importantly, he must have sequenced by then. 6 now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlson pushed his glasses and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlock, you are also a god Believers, we hope to establish a good relationship with you. If you have any problems in the future, you can tell us what information you have collected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Develop the thread who is the "mechanical heart"... I have another channel for reimbursement... Klein draws a triangular emblem on the chest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer being "heart of machinery" "Protected Klein, after dinner in the Craig Club, then took the carriage and slowly returned to No. 15 Minsk Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He habitually opened the letter box and saw a new letter, a letter without a stamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter was left after the unsuccessful visit of Essinger Stanton’s detective in the afternoon. He wrote:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I heard about the advice you gave from the heart of the machine. Your sensitivity and rigor are shocking. If you have not become an extraordinary person, I even think that the 'reader' It is the best way for you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the young man I have ever known to be good at reasoning! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein stood in the living room and watched the light of the gas wall lamp The letter left by Essinger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no novelty in this performance, step by step, before repeating, not even playing a big role... but winning The audience was enough, and the audience was around me, so I got the feedback directly... Klein took the stationery and suddenly felt it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He half When I close my eyes, I feel that something in the body is disintegrating and dissipating. I feel that there are many illusory stars around me, and I feel that those cockroaches have a very weak attraction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
