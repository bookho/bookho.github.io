			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Klein smashed his forehead and slowly calmed down his emotions and found that this matter had little to do with himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no power to blend, no matter whether the Lun army has found Turani von Helmo Xiu, he does not care because he The Kingdom of Lun lacks a sense of belonging. The things that have been done in the past simply hope that the society will be stable and the people will not be harmed by accidents. If it is possible, he is willing to promote change and let the lower classes live at least as individuals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect to come to this world, I am more like an internationalist..." He laughed and returned to the real world, ready to go out and sleep, let alone The waves are undulating outside and the storm is plundering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, his eyes flashed to the largest item in the debris pile - the radio ticker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking, what is the power that controls Turanie von Hermosyn? If it is the 'mysterious queen' Bernard The person, nothing, she is a person who keeps 'doing what I want, but don't hurt' the motto, will not do too much.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the top of the rose school, it’s not very good. Except for the internal temperate sect, the 'dead gods' or the 'desire mother tree' are not as evil as the aurora, let them master The most advanced technology, I am afraid it will bring disaster..." Klein stopped the action of wrapping himself with spirituality, and his fingers tapped the edge of the mottled long table.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He quickly got the idea, that is, to get the radio ticker back to the real world, adjust to the corresponding frequency band, see if you can receive the "blood on the top" group of telegrams, and then use the password book in hand to carry out Interpretation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight, the whole city is being investigated, things are quite subtle When important nodes, if they are controlled by Hermosus, the necessary telegram exchanges are likely to occur... in the case that the Governor’s Office, the Lun Army and the Storm Church have not paid attention to or even accepted the technology, This is a very safe way, so, 'the blood will be 'a group of people after the death of the old Quinn, there is no small probability of unchanging frequency bands and passwords... in short, give it a try. After the completion of the scrutiny, Klein did not delay, returned to the real world, busy preparing for the ceremony to receive the gift.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After getting the radio ticker to the room, he did not Direct use, but the ceremonial silver plaque, created the spiritual wall of the sealed room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is in the smell, dispelling the fog "Taste"!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, it is not necessary to determine which side of the control of Hermosyn is not so troublesome, directly relying on the breath of fog, connected Mirror "Arodes, you can get a valid answer, but the problem is that this is too close to the last question and answer, the frequent appearance of the taste may be noticed by the "real creator", "original witch" and other evil spirits, very not Security.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Klein is cautious and intends to rely on himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seven or eight Minutes, after feeling that the "taste" was almost the same, he dismissed the spiritual wall, operated the radio ticker, and began to monitor.<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how long it took, the corresponding frequency suddenly appeared in the wave!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein pressed his inner joy and carefully recorded Then, open the codebook that was previously reproduced by divination and interpret it accordingly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he wrote a line of words on the sticky note: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Pepper Avenue 32, 7am tomorrow morning. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the control of Hermosus is due to the "blood admiral" group, there may be a strong group of rose school behind... Ryan immediately made a judgment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not based on the content of the telegram, but a simple reasoning from the existence of the telegram itself.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——If they don’t have anything to do with “blood above”, they don’t have such a good time to send telegrams about Baiyam’s streets!<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The meaning of this telegram is that it will go to No. 32 Black Pepper Avenue before 7:00 tomorrow morning? Or, Helmouchin and ‘silver venom’ Odell are now hiding there, and are reporting the position to ‘blood on the top’, giving the corresponding time? Klein thought about it and immediately returned to the fog. Combined with the information obtained, he wrote the divination statement:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Turanny von Helmo has been in the current position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With paper, leaning against the back of the chair, Klein repeated in a slang Read the content and enter the dream with meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray world, he saw an underground hall with countless gas wall lamps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge and complex machine in the hall, which consists of a copper column, a joystick, a connecting arm and countless tight gears. Composition, occupying two-thirds of the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old man with a thin, messy hair wrapped in a thick coat, walking back and forth in front of the machine, throwing a candy into his mouth from time to time, biting It is rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it shouldn’t be called a difference machine anymore. It’s a cute guy who can analyze the problem and calculate the answer according to the set process. Yes, it’s The name must be called 'analyzer'!" The old man kept talking to himself, and Klein's perspective stretched up and out of the underground hall to the upper building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a three-story small villa with a garden and lawn, with a house number hanging outside, which reads:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Pepper Avenue 32!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough... Klein opened his eyes and slowly vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he started to struggle for the next question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So a big scientist is useless to me, but it is the source of trouble. It is impossible to always throw him on the fog, so completely There is no need to take it in person and take him away... Well, give the information to the Lun Army or the Storm Church? This can effectively avoid the benefits of the Rose School, but there is a faction in the military that should be foggy with Beckland. There is a connection between the behind-the-scenes of the incident. It is not a good thing for Hermosus to fall into their hands... The Storm Church is a famous impulse. A surprise may cause a big scientist to see the gods of his faith..." Klein After careful consideration, I gradually got a bold idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to put things in the face, let the existence and ownership of Turani von Hermosyn to the Lun army, to the major The church is not a secret, and this can effectively ensure that the power of the great scientist acts on the kingdom of the country, not on the other side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The check and balance is the key... Klein smiled and whispered a word, and took a shot and took the "Poseidon Scepter". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the former, to open the matter, to the bright side, can only carefully send the "flyer" throughout the city, and now, he has more Simple and more effective way! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected a believer who was praying, and Klein took his vision and included the scenes of the nearby five-kilometer range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, with the help of "Poseidon Scepter", he grasped the wind around him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly calm, Klein will sink his mind into the picture, change the voice, and mute the voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Hermoshine at 32 Black Pepper Avenue!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of Baiyam, the wind is fierce, blowing up in all directions, accompanied by a dull but grand voice:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hermoshine at 32 Black Pepper Avenue!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hermoshine at 32 Black Pepper Avenue! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice spreads Baiyam very quickly, just like it is coming The whole city broadcast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver Coin Snake" Odell is wearing a cloak, pretending to be Helmo Xiuin, hiding in the slum area where the crowds of people are mixed, and appearing from time to time, Guide the MI9 and the personnel of the police department under the Governor's Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the wind blew through and poured a voice into his ear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ermo Xiuin at No. 32 Black Pepper Avenue!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
