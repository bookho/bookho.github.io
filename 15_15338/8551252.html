			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein hiding in the shadow of a house dozens of meters away has been looking at the target building in the dark, faintly heard a fierce wind, clearly distinguishing the pong The pong shot was shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the enemy fled to my place, should I pull the gun to look like it, or pretend not to see it?" His body shuddered slightly, his palms sweated. Thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary person who can shorten the life of the dead by various means is absolutely impossible to have only sequence 9 or sequence 8, not his diviner can face confrontation, Even if you sacrifice yourself, you may not be able to delay the other side and create a chance for them to catch up with Dunn and Leonard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the goddess of the night who seems to be in trouble seems to have heard the prayer of his "faithful" guards, and no one has fled to the position where Klein is hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, he heard a flying song from the target building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the ear, carefully distinguishing, Klein confirmed that this is the folklore of Leonard Mitchell, which is full of vulgar statements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, he sighed, holding a gun, a cane, coming out of the shadows and moving closer to the target building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This folk minor tune is exactly the agreement between him and Dunn and others! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just two steps, Klein suddenly paused, leaning his cane against the iron fence next to him and turning his left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he untied the silver chain in his cuff and let the citrine pendant fall naturally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the revolver and the pendulum was exchanged. Klein waited until the citrine was shaking smoothly, and immediately closed his eyes halfway, entered the state of meditation, and silently recited the divination statement: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The song just was an illusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The song just was an illusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven times, he opened his eyes and saw the pendant turning counterclockwise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not an illusion..." Klein put his heart back in place, slammed the spirit, put on his cane, and quickly approached the arch of the target building. The iron fence gate, then handed the silver-plated black cane to the right palm and was taken with the left wheel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just reached out and touched the railing, trying to push it away, and suddenly felt the bitter coolness coming in, just like being unprepared Ice cubes stuffed around the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘶! Klein jerked his hand and licked his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the same as winter..." He fainted the starlight and the streetlights in the distance, looking out at the garden behind the gate of the iron fence, seeing the branches withered The flowers are dying, and many leaves are stained with hoarfrost on the dark brown soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great! Klein secretly sighed, and he slammed his eyebrows twice and opened his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the silver-plated black wooden rod in his left hand and used it against the fence, pushing the open door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sound of the cymbal, he passed sideways and embarked on a stone road that went straight to the gray-blue building, and the two sides were hidden in the dark as if they were ghosts. plant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This picture makes Klein think of a variety of ghost stories and spooky movies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously slowed down his breathing and speeded up his steps. He just walked a few meters and was shot by the left shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compass!噗通! Klein’s heart was first stagnation and then violently beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his right hand, aimed at that direction with the revolver, then slowly turned and looked over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does this scare yourself?" Klein twitched his mouth and waved his cane to knock the branch down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to move forward, and there was a crying, sorrowful sound in his ears, and his eyes reflected a transparent, fuzzy, close Invisible "shadow". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These shadows feel the breath of the living and the warmth of flesh and blood, and they have come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein was shocked and immediately ran up and rushed into the main entrance of the gray-blue house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the captain said about the atmosphere? It’s really more horrible than helping Sir Deville... The resentment is obviously more rigid than the “shadow”, and there is no active attack... He wants to go to the altar in the center of the living room, which is a round table filled with Rough puppets, and three extinguished candles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den Smith is standing in front of the altar, facing Klein, a puppet and a puppet to pick up and watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The corpse" Frye quietly watched the floating "shadows", trying to reach out to appease them, but only through the powerless, and The "shadows" did not attack him, and seemed to regard him as a kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Mitchell sees Klein arrive, the tone changes, the voice becomes low and magnetic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a quiet morning,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is suitable for the more peaceful sorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only heard through the withered autumn leaves"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sound of chestnuts gently landing." (Note 1)<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gentle and quiet poetry sings, Klein seems to have seen a picture On the lake in the moonlight, I saw the red moon hanging quietly at high altitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "shadows" calmed down, no longer chasing the breath of the living and the warmth of flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dun put down the puppet in his hand and turned back to Klein:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is a terrible curse ceremony. Fortunately, we have destroyed it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You first arrange the ceremony, appease the remaining spirituality, and then try to pass Spirit, see if you can get clues from them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Founding that he is no longer cumbersome, Klein immediately raised his head:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Captain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He arrived at the altar two or three steps and reached out to sweep the puppets out of the round table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he has different names and corresponding information on each puppet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, do you find someone you know?" Klein asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the question, he looked at Dunn, and Dunn looked at him again, and both sides fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am stupid... How can I ask questions about the memory of the captain! Klein almost covered his face and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other leaders, I will definitely look for opportunities to wear small shoes for me. Fortunately, fortunately, the captain will forget this thing... I really don't know. This is an advantage, or a shortcoming... He is half lucky and thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, Dunn seems to finally understand the reality and the dream, and said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "There is a person you know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Klein stopped the action of repositioning the candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce Mayer? Anna's fiancé... Klein thinks that Sols, who is in the almshouse, seems to have been instructed to be instructed, and will break out in advance and try to set fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He retracted his right hand and said: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Teacher' Tries?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He made sacrifices with the shortened life of the dead, trying to curse all the survivors of the 'nickname tragedy'? Because he didn't know who found the problem Reported the police..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if Tries directly retaliates, it is unlikely that one can dispose of all the targets scattered in different places at once, at most two After three cases, he will be noticed by the night servants, the punters and the heart of the machine, losing the opportunity to continue committing crimes... Klein almost filled out the idea of ​​why the other side chose so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean first nodded and then shook his head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not all survivors, is Timing All the survivors of the city, his curse ritual can only affect the people in this range."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, the host of the ceremony is a woman, not a tris. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein frowned slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe the spirit will be sent to help Tries The strong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the source of the Gnosis may involve the witch sect, the strong is a woman is normal."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deng smiled and said with awkward voice: "I agree with your judgment, although there is only that woman, there is no Tries, but you can make the necessary guesses, for example, they do not live in Together, for example, Tries is going out to find someone who will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein didn’t say more, put three candles, take out the full moon oil and deep Red sandalwood and other materials , Rapid deployment Well altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the silver enamel to create a sealed wall, he began to pray to the "night goddess, sleeping and silent lord", completely calming the "ghost" inside and outside the house ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, in the follow-up psychic, Klein only saw a small number of pictures of the remaining spiritual life, and did not get useful clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let these "ghosts" really sleep in the darkness, he ended the ceremony, lifted the wall of spirituality, and shook his head to Dunn, Leonard and Frye: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The anti-phasic that was interrupted by the ceremony was severely damaged, and the image of the owner's remains was lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dun did not accidentally point to the stairway:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we go to the second floor and look for it. Try it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Klein and Leonard and others immediately agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three nights follow the steps, all the way to the second floor, and search each room separately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, they would fit into a bedroom with a fragrant floating, seeing the messy skirts and seeing the unfolded boxes one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a cosmetic?" Dunn picked up a box from the dressing table and smelled it. He asked a question <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Accurately, called skin care products, since Russell the Great, they are no longer mixed." Leonard smiled and corrected, "Captain, as a gentleman, necessary Common sense still needs to be understood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein did not join their discussion and turned their attention to the mirror on the dresser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mirror has a distinct crack, with fragments falling on the carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The extraordinary person is a little hasty, the destruction is not thorough enough..." He suddenly said quietly, "maybe you can give it a try."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
